10/28/2017,5.0,"I love coming to this Starbucks downtown either during my lunch break or after work. I don't drink coffee so I come either to get a cup of tea and I get a pound cake too. I have gotten lunch here twice - once I had a Turkey (or Chicken) pesto snadwich that was heated up and another time, I used my Starbucks birthday reward to get a chicken salad. I love this location because it is clean, the staff is friendly, and there is never a long line. There is ample seating inside and outside as well.",2,2,3,Agnes I.,"Lakewood, OH",46,228,85,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Fj2TxzExnThgT5nRVWwFyg
5/1/2017,4.0,"Resident Starbucks Guru is back at it again folks...this time all the way in downtown Cleveland. I like to shake things up. I am cool like that! Although, parking downtown is never fun and the city charges a boatload to park. Even the meters only give you 10 min per quarter. I was afraid to sneeze or fart....because the city might charge me for that too!This Starbucks has a really cool feel to it. It is in one of the older buildings in downtown and I love the charm that brings. The new Starbucks construction is always modern and cool, but the ones put in old buildings have a special charm that you cannot get with new construction.My iced coffee was as yummy as always. Nothing to complain about in the product quality department!The staff here was friendly. I always appreciate a warm smile and human engagement. However, they were a tad bit on the slow side. Not because they were busy though....they were quite chatty amongst themselves. I am chatty myself, so I get it. Just please give me my coffee lol I can get kinda irrational without it :)",2,2,2,Raymond M.,"Ravenna, OH",137,1326,186,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NlNlyQynkyEU3l7TR3LXdg
11/5/2017,4.0,Stopped in to get some work done before a meeting. Associates were nice. Place was clean. The only reason I give it 4/5 is because seating is sparse. I'd hate to order a coffee and then not have anywhere to get work done!,0,0,0,Daniel H.,"Cleveland, OH",77,48,294,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=guPzpFwYAMNpn8p66QmSbQ
8/25/2016,5.0,"After a late lunch at West 3rd Deli, I stopped in here for a brain re-boot - meaning more caffeine!Ordered a Grande cold brew with room for cream. Drink was strong and delicious and hit the spot! Got the ole neurons re-firing!There is a decent amount of seating here to work and/or hang out inside, and a number of tables outside as well.",1,1,3,Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",4338,28629,1166,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A
8/14/2017,4.0,"I love the big bright windows and outdoor seating, and the baristas are always cordial, though I've never had one that is especially friendly. There is a lot of space to spread out and work, and all of the normal Starbucks drinks and treats. The location is excellent and there are a lot of other fun places to explore nearby, as well as good food if you're looking for an after-coffee bite.",0,0,0,Nicole A.,"Roanoke, VA",129,90,79,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RlG8zsrWfYNaMzmT9ILCiA
2/4/2017,5.0,"Typical Starbucks, but the staff is extremely friendly! Although I'm not a regular, they treated me like I was! And for their regulars, on a cold morning, they often had their drinks ready for them before they got in the door. While there's not much seating, the seating that is there is clean and inviting. Also, the hours on here (at least for Saturday) are incorrect. They were open by the time I rolled in around 6:34am, and they regularly open at 6 on Saturday mornings.",1,1,1,Katie F.,"Akron, OH",52,36,23,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KgleK7YUXOWzpFzoWxzxpw
11/18/2016,5.0,"The employees at this location are always super nice and friendly! They gave my dog her first cup of whipped cream and made her so happy! The inside of the store was recently updated and is 10x better than before, although it is a smaller sized store. There is a small sidewalk patio area with around 4 tables, which is popular in the summer. Drinks, food and merchandise is all standard, but they offer a nice variety of snacks for their size.",0,0,0,Karsen E.,"Boston, MA",188,187,212,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Qt2qt95HgYK-qYLlThATBw
8/2/2015,3.0,"The drinks at this Starbucks are always good, but the staff can be really hit or miss! Sometimes they're incredibly friendly, and other times they wear a look of annoyance. I should not have to feel apologetic when I order a venti pike place roast from you, sir!  Anyway, the space itself is quite small. I've gone here a few times and tried to find a place to post up and work, but there have been no seats available. They do have a few tables outside, which is quite lovely if you're able to snag one. Also a good place for people watching (not that I do that or anything...)",0,0,0,Stephanie B.,"Cleveland, OH",83,155,101,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GPXeCXlwepOq8AVccRXZiA
1/7/2016,4.0,"This is a really tiny Sbux, aside from the kiosk variety, this is the smallest one I've been to. There's counter seating, a big table for groups, and two two-top tables - that's it. I personally really liked the counter seats. It feels for some reason like the place one should sit in a real coffee shop. Not the best spot if you are trying to work, but a cool place to pass the time. And the barista can hand your drink right to you instead of you picking it up from the end of the line, which again feels more like what a ""real"" coffee shop experience should try to emulate. Other than that good drinks and friendly staff - your usual Starbucks.",0,0,0,Ben S.,"Cleveland, OH",892,773,265,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RylA6VZUTRuMGBu4nHKbCw
5/22/2013,4.0,"This is an older Starbucks location.  Service is quick and efficient, the store is generally clean and the drinks are well-made.  They have a larger table that is nice for studying, but it is often occupied.  They also have two comfortable lounge chairs near the door that are popular with the paper-reading crowd.They are not quite as good about keeping the non-fat milk in stock out on the floor, but if you ask the barista they will happily oblige.",1,0,1,James P.,"Southfield, MI",37,130,7,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KeQ7VBvYhvMOZ8cJ80C2Lg

12/31/2012,3.0,"It's Starbucks and it gets the job done with an always-working WiFi. However, this location is much smaller than most and there's no good seating away from the door. Since winter is Cleveland's best 9 months of the year, don't expect to come in to warm up.",2,0,0,Derek C.,"Indianapolis, IN",228,104,84,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tN2ml7LWTM2AcZz6JI7ZuQ
1/12/2011,4.0,It's fast....it's overpriced....it's damn good.  I can't complain and while I try different places to get coffee weekly.....this and Caribou seem to be the ones we gravitate towards the most.  We all pretty much know the menu by now.....,0,1,0,Craig L.,"Cleveland, OH",182,930,402,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8v1rpTH0d8YjjGWA892l1Q
5/11/2011,3.0,"Love the staff...hate the interior design.  It's just not a comfortable place to hang out like other Starbucks locations.  But since they have longer hours than Phoenix, I spend more time here.",0,0,0,Jen M.,"Cleveland, OH",2029,16,553,https://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-cleveland-25?osq=starbucks,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Xxvz5g67eaCr3emnkY5M6w
