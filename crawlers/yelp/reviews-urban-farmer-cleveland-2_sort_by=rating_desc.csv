10/27/2017,4.0,"Most of the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The Ohio Ribeye was delicious and I should've paired it with the asparagus (as the server had recommended) because the bok choy just wasn't so great. When my server (Nancee) returned to ask how I liked everything and I said I wasn't a big fan of the bok choy, she quickly offered to replace it with the asparagus which was indeed much better and has a kick. Be sure to strike up a conversation with Mike in their Charcuterie -- not only is he a wealth of knowledge but he will excited they share it with you. He told me that their manual retro-looking meat slicer cost as much as his brand new Kia. The very sweet hostess let me choose a different table than where she had originally taken me with a can-do attitude while also accommodating my iPhone charging as it was down to 1%. Without hesitation or frustration she simply unplugged her company iPad at the hostess stand and charged my phone over the next 30 minutes or so (Only after first taking a lap around the restaurant to see if she could seat me near an outlet). Another server who'd just flipped around from having delivered someone's check, offered to walk me around (guide me) towards the restroom... Instead of just pointing like most people do today. There was only one exception to this but nearly all staff members delivered just the right balance of friendliness and professionalism. It's a beautiful place with great food - albeit "" steakhouse-pricey"" - and dependable service.",5,0,0,Steve D.,"Gaithersburg, MD",45,1,24,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xGspXiibbKyAPCw5TWEh3Q
11/16/2017,3.0,"Urban Farmer is your stereotypical upper class bar and restaurant. On this visit, we went for drinks. The drinks were all extremely strong and lacked the extra oomph to make the strength enjoyable. With an Apple cider whiskey drink a little spice to round the drink out would have been nice to take the sharpness of the whiskey out. We also had their seasonal drink, a Cafe Cleveland, though it was altered to accommodate food allergies. Overall a fun drink to get with table-side fire and theatrics, the actual drink was a little lackluster. It tasted strongly on straight vodka with an almost burnt, bitter coffee follow up. Three stars goes for the fact the staff was accommodating and experimental with food allergies. This alone makes the restaurant worthwhile though their drinks need a little more finessing to compete with expanding craft cocktail market in Cleveland.As for food, they do use latex gloves in their preparation, so I was unable to try anything as they did not have a latex free option. Here's hoping they move to latex free in the future!",2,1,1,Kayla G.,"Cleveland, OH",23,18,30,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=raEdyz_mL8Gic4n3ZRFoGw
10/20/2017,1.0,"Well, i would have loved to tell everyone about the beautiful food and drink at Urban Farmer, except I never got any because our server never appeared.  Actually, that's not fair, he did appear, about six times, near our table and even made eye contact but never decided to stop by. I'm trying to decide if going back there is worth the price. One would think that to operate a restaurant that boasts such an impressive menu one would also have an equally impressive service staff.",3,0,0,Alyse F.,"Tampa, FL",2,0,185,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZhE9dMRuDpdkjFnnqJY6KQ
12/4/2017,5.0,My first time here and I visited for brunch. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and specific details about the items we had questions about. All the meals were exceptionally delicious and well worth the upscale prices. I like the decor that fit perfectly with the theme. They even gave us corn seed packets with our bill. Cute touch! Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items and check out the dinner menu!,1,0,0,Meredith W.,"Tremont, Cleveland, OH",78,44,203,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jZeIY0sxS5J5vt-Tl6uzzw
10/20/2017,3.0,"I was staying at the Westin Cleveland Downtown hotel for a few days for work - the Urban Farmer is attached to the hotel.I had breakfast in here two mornings, plus dinner one evening, and cocktails a couple of times.The breakfasts were very good - and very expensive. The first breakfast was around $30+ dollars. The next morning, I ordered one that was less expensive - around $18 or so. The food was very good.One evening, I had a bowl of soup and then a burger, sans bun (low carb). The soup, I believe it was an Oxtail soup - was rather ordinary, it lacked richness, complexity, and seasoning. The burger was pretty good - served with add ons of bacon and avocado.Service was hit or miss. Service during breakfast was very good. At dinner - when my soup was served - it was brought out with no soup spoon or - silverware. I had to wait for a server to come by (not mine) and request a spoon. I was brought a spoon - that WAS NOT a soup spoon - and the spoon was dirty. I set it aside and waited - another waiter came by - and I showed him the spoon, asked if it was a soup spoon, it was not - he brought me a soup spoon and silverwear roll (napkin and eating utensils).One evening - our work completed for the week, we visited for cocktails. I ordered their version of a Manhattan - not a fan of their style. We also sampled the 14 year old Oban and 16 year old Lagavulin single malt scotch. We ordered most of our cocktails at the bar and brought them back to our table since our server was hard to find.#UrbanFarmer",2,0,0,Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",4338,28629,1166,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A
9/11/2017,4.0,The everlasting search to experience great brunch spots around Cleveland ended up taking me here on an almost autumn Saturday morning. This is one of those places I've passed numerous times but just never came around to visiting. But this time I'm glad I did.  The brunch menu was quite extensive with multiple choices. Additionally the make your own mimosa bar was a nice touch as well. The champagne is brought to your table in a separate glass and you take your wine glass to the bar and add your choice of fruit/juices for your drink.This visit i ordered the French toast along with the chicken sausage. Both were very good and I recommend both options. Also i suggest asking for extra syrup on the side. Also I must give an honorable mention to the crispy breakfast potato. It was the perfect blend of crispness and flavor. Do yourself a favor and get one on the side!,2,0,0,Craighton Y.,"Cleveland, OH",71,103,67,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=McPdGlOf-Mv58CLMofj7HA
8/5/2017,5.0,"Just when we gave up hope of Cleveland having any decent restaurants we had our last dinner in town here and it was amazing. You can give Michael Symon's place a big old skip and come here instead if you want impressive service and even more impressive food.The restaurant is clean and the decor is a modern farm to table vibe. It's awesome. It's definitely on the spendy side but also totally worth it. We started with the cheese service which is wheeled over on a cart and we were given samples of each cheese we could choose from to build our cheese plate. With each sample we were given the region, the aging process, and the methods used on how the particular flavors were developed. It was a fun, informative, delicious experience. We then chose six cheeses to build our board. All of them were incredible. For dinner we all ordered steaks. These were all prime examples of what beef should be. The cook was absolutely perfect and the meat was delicious. So much better than the grease ball called ribeye you'd get at Lola's. Seriously, if you want good steak, come here. They list each cut of beef and then you can choose the weight, region, and type (corn fed, grass fed). It's phenomenal. The sides were all equally tasty and big enough to share with the table. The cocktails were also incredibly creative and delicious. I had a cocktail (ok, three) with pickled beet juice that were amazing.After all the let downs in Cleveland's dining scene, this place is a rockstar and competes with some of the best restaurants I've been to in the country. Go here. You won't be disappointed, especially if you're a carnivore.",6,0,4,Amanda K.,"Gainesville, FL",141,69,36,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Z5j9Xw_G0c7M2b1-iS67wg
12/5/2017,5.0,"Best steakhouse in Cleveland. Highly recommend the New York Steak Tasting, in which you get 3 different 6oz. steaks (grass-fed, prime corn-fed and 21 day dry aged) Throw in the Waigu to complete the tasting for a few bucks more. It's fascinating how the same steak can taste SO different, and fun to share as a group and discuss favorites. Baked Mac n' Cheese and Creamed Spinach Gratin make nice shareable​ sides to go with the steaks. Sunday Brunch is a hit as well.",0,0,0,Moe B.,"Cleveland, OH",23,0,85,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=et2aBoZ50-LFuTPLc7-FZQ
11/15/2017,5.0,"Really love the atmosphere here. It's fun, servers are nice and food is always really great. Their biscuits are amazing here. They also had a really phenomenal Bloody Mary bar, something I can't wait to share with other people. The only things that I'm not a huge fan of is 1. They only really advertised their mimosa bar, nothing else from a drink perspective. 2. It was actually pretty chilly in the restaurant. I would have made sure guests were comfortable! Definitely will be back, they support a lot of local non profits, which matters a lot to me.",1,0,0,Daniel H.,"Cleveland, OH",77,48,294,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=guPzpFwYAMNpn8p66QmSbQ

                Previous review",3.0,"Urban Farmer is unique compared to other local steak houses as it serves meat from cows that have been been grass fed, corn fed then grain finished or completely corn fed. The steaks are not my favorite. I find even the corn fed steaks to be a bit tougher and drier than what other local steakhouses serve. To see for yourself though you can get a steak sampler and try side-by-side the various types of steaks. Steaks aside I do like the seasonal rotation of ingredients that find their way into the salads and sides. This keeps the sides interesting and updated frequently. I enjoyed the squash gratin. The dish contained thin sliced squash, just a little bit of cheese and a good serving of sausage mixed in.   The appetizer list is a bit limited when it comes to sharing a dish. My best recommendation would be the tartare. The tartare is served with a deviled egg and mixed with fennel and parmesan and is excellent. I'd say it is one of the things Urban Farmer is known for. If you are not a raw beef fan, the charcuterie or the cheese boards are good options. Some evenings there is a cheesemonger on duty that wheels around a cart with the night's selection of cheeses providing samples and information on the offerings whether or not you purchase a cheese board. For dessert I enjoyed the butterscotch sundae. Served in a jar, this dessert had a nice crunchy bottom layer (a blondie) and is topped with ice cream.Compared to other steakhouses I prefer Urban Farmer for it's appetizer and desserts. Since that isn't the main attraction at a steakhouse I was slightly disappointed. But not to worry, there are fish options on the menu as well. The cocktail menu is good as well. While a bit gin heavy, there are good options that the bartenders themselves have created.",1422,11,3,Ben S.,"Cleveland, OH",892,773,265,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RylA6VZUTRuMGBu4nHKbCw
9/6/2017,3.0,"Strolled into Urban Farmer for lunch and decided to sit around the bar since I was flying solo today. I was greeted pretty quickly with a glass of water. First glance at the menu, this place is pretty pricey. After some debate, I decided to go with the Beef Tenderloin Chili Mac. One, I'm a carb lover. Two, I love chili. This dish was yummy. The beef tenderloin was so... dare I say it? Tender. The chili was the perfect amount of savory. It could maybe use a bit more kick or spice, but that's just me. It was the perfect portion to be satisfied and not overstuffed. I don't know if I'll stroll into Urban Farmer again, but at least this visit wasn't disappointing.",1,1,1,Michelle L.,"Houston, TX",101,75,331,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=L3OpE2GTvELy4CVcoATStg
5/21/2017,3.0,"The food here is very mediocre and over priced. The service is also very slow. Came here because we had a company event in the hotel so we had to eat here a few days in a row. The first night I ordered the local greens salad and oxtail soup. The salad was very boring and a very small portion for the price. The oxtail soup hardly had any meat in it, it wasn't filling at all and it didn't taste very good either. My coworker ordered a burger and they accidentally left the paper that separates the patties on on it. He had a mouth full of paper in his first bite. After he told them they apologized and took it off our bill. The next day we had breakfast there and the service was incredibly slow. I ordered an omelette and side of fruit. It was pretty good but the portions seemed really small.",1,2,0,Joanne C.,"Northridge, CA",183,321,70,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RwVMtlo9TTH9i6A08V71bg
9/17/2017,4.0,"This is a really nice upscale downtown restaurant with a lot of unique drink options and high end liquors and wines. I brought some clients for a night out before a ball game and had a great experience. They have many grass fed, grain fed, dry aged or American Wagyu options. It was nice that Wagyu came in various cuts. Many high end places only give one option. I tried the ribeye and really enjoyed it. Great marveling and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Everyone else in my group got the steak sampler. Which gave 3 - 6 oz. ny Strip steaks with an option to add a 4th Wagyu option. Everyone in my group other than myself got this. It has grass fed, grain fed, 21 day dry aged grain fed and the adder of Wagyu. Massive amount of food. The grass fed was the least favorite option which makes sense but great to get to see what everyone truly likes best. Great scientific research. We also got the cheese charcuterie which was a good selection of various cheeses and honey. We also got the beef tartar which I had never had before. Visually it isn't appealing and not sure how it could be with raw meat in it but the taste was great. Definitely a place I would return to and a place to impress. The setup inside was very well thought out and very visually appealing. I liked how the menu also showed the farms and the states where the beef came from. Very cool that there were some local options. Try it out, be very hungry and just get the Wagyu you'll be glad you did.",0,0,0,Jamin F.,"Charleston, WV",73,71,61,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tuWfuUu3P0Wu_k4E4BjXgw
9/5/2017,5.0,"An other excellent meal at The Urban Farmer this last weekend! The first time we visited was for Sunday brunch and we immediately decided that we needed to come back for dinner. We arrived Saturday evening and noted a positive vibe in the dinning room, couples to small groups enjoying a night out on the town. The decor is nice, clean and not your typical wood and leather steak house look, pictures of local food suppliers on the wall and a beautiful display of preserved food making up a room divide. Seated right away in a nice booth and menus where brought out quickly. Well rounded drink menu with a extensive selection of whiskey, tequila, cordials and wines that sound meet most dinners wants. We started with a dozen oysters on the half shell, a mix of east and west coast, that were fresh and cleanly shucked. Our main course selection was a local sourced steak from Madison, Oh. Mine was served up a perfect rare plus while my wife's was on the temperature mark of medium. Both steaks were tasty, properly cooked and seasoned just right. We split side dishes of mushrooms and a seasonal blistered beans. I would happily order these sides again. We ended the meal with a selection of cheeses that were served up table side. It was nice to be able to sample the varieties before making the final selection and having a enthusiastic server helping on the selection process.",0,0,0,Thomas W.,"Bay Village, OH",52,0,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9pVyVvwwBEi0xv-OgCnlag
12/1/2017,5.0,"I ate here recently and had a great experience.   The service was very attentive and kind.   Our meal was so enjoyable.   Here's what we had, bone marrow, steak tartar, squid, 24 ounce steak, cheese plate appetizer, potatoes, and mushrooms.   To drink we had a bourbon (great selection) and bottle of Malbec.    There is nothing we would have changed.   The bill for our meal was not cheap but it was worth it.   Try this place if you've never been.  Enjoy!  Btw, there was four of us.",0,0,0,John G.,"Brecksville, OH",2,2,0,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hgcqbQ9br5Rn5WoFl3mEjA
3/20/2017,4.0,"While visiting my girlfriends family in Cleveland we decided on Urban Farmer for brunch after 8am Mass.  The space is beautiful with nice banquettes and booths throughout the restaurant. We were seated and greeted promptly by our waiter.  After perusing the menu I decided on the Sirloin eggs Benedict and added a crispy potato cake on the side.  The eggs on the benedict were perfectly poached, the hollandaise nice and flavorful, the sirloin was cut super thin like how roast beef is sliced on a deli slicer. The housemade english muffin was good, however I thought it was too dense. The potato cake was delicious and it soaked up my runny yolk from the poached eggs. Overall a good experience  and I will be back.",3,1,3,Bill E.,"Delaware, OH",422,643,140,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=z1UrbSoWK5-h4nOfMpoliw
2/25/2017,4.0,"Had a nice relaxed Saturday lunch last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is laid back casual and trendy with huge glass windows looking out two sides on a downtown corner. It is attached to the Westin Hotel. The service was attentive without being overbearing and the suggestions made were spot on for what we were there for. They cook from scratch and use locally sourced fresh ingredients, which always excites me. They make their own English muffins that they also serve their burger on. This sounded interesting and we had to try it! We ordered the burger medium and it came out pink, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The muffin was delicious but a bit dense, thick and a tad over powering for the burger. I wish it had had more aioli on it as well, it was lost under the rest of the burger. We were planning to split it and they kindly cut it and served it on two plates with two small bowls of fries... so thoughtful and appreciated! It also came with pickled vegetables which in my opinion were a home run. They nicely cut the rich fats of the burger. So Good! They had a Bloody Mary bar, and I had to have one. I liked the garnishes I chose, especially the chunks of bacon and pickled green tomatoes. The prices were a bit high. I do understand that it's attached to a hotel which tends to bump prices a bit, this just still seemed a little out of typical range. I would definitely recommend a visit and will likely return!",5,3,1,Kristen M.,"Mentor, OH",163,396,9,https://www.yelp.com/biz/urban-farmer-cleveland-2,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EtxsD-Jbyxh7TsaWHtGCew
2/12/2017,5.0,"I don't always give 5 stars but this place killed it! Sunday brunch started with the mimosa bar- to note there is also a Bloody Mary bar, but we decided to go the champagne route. Selection of juices, purees (get the strawberry) and fruit to go along with it!For the starters we ordered the smoked fish which was salmon. Absolutely amazing and the add ins it came with were great. I think there were onions soaked on beer juice if I was correct for one of the items which was so different! We shared with 4 people but I easily could've gotten this for myself as a main meal and been overly satisfied.Next let's talk about the Benedicts- HUGE!!!! Easily the size of a bagel in diameter per piece. I had the avocado and my boyfriend had the sirloin steak which was loaded with meat that was sliced thin and cooked perfectly. We also ordered steak and eggs which was good, came with sausage gravy which was the lighter color with chunks that i prefer over the darker ones. The ""breakfast potatoes"" was a hash brown type as you would get at mcdonalds, but wayyy better and perfectly crispy on the outside.We also got the French toast to share which I thought was good but I'm not a huge sweets with breakfast person (with hazelnut and blueberries). Again 4 HUGE pieces. My dad also (we eat a lot haha) got the duck confit and could not stop raving about the duck.This place will not be a ""one and done"" wouldLove to try dinner or lunch!The inside was had very neat decor and a bar that looked stocked with an extensive whiskey selection.

7/23/2017,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic! We were in town, for a work event, and needed some good food/experience to start the night off properly! This did not disappoint, and delivered an amazing experience for both my employee and me. The cheese plate was an unexpected compliment to a fabulous dinner service. I need to find out where they get that brie with the custom made rind... as it was perfectly balanced and one of the best cheeses I've had in a while. Oh yeah - the cornbread in a can - knocks it out of the park! Ask for it right away, when you sit down :)I ordered the scallop dish, and it was well balanced with fat/acid/crunch/softness/chew, etc. Brilliant dish! Scallops are too often taken for granted, and the accompanying salad and sauce made them shine! Good plate chef, thank you. My tech got the walleye and it was cooked to perfection, and seasoned properly too. Everything we had was spot on, and I don't think our water glass got below half full, before they filled it each and every time. We also tried the oyster app, and the Chevre Toast app... which started off the flavorful experience right!
