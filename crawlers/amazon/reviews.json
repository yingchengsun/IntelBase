Well they had me read the serial number and Part number on the box and it did not match what was on the phone, they also said if you know the last four numbers of the original owners phone number we may help you, I was mad I said oh really how would I know that you told me the phone is stolen now adding salt to injury they then suspended my account thinking I stoled the phone. Well I went down to the Apple store to see what they could do for me since it is a Apple product. 1) they said iPhone 5 is not available (New) it is only refurbished and 2) they also confirmed that it was (stolen) and there was nothing I could do. Mean while I spent a good part of Mother's Day trying to convince At&t that I am a victim here, that I did not steel the phone and pleaded with At&t to re-enstate my account with them, which they finally did.

Some things were better and some were not. While my family has had many Android and iOS devices, the iOS devices cost more but generally get (much) more use, plus they hold their value better. My favorite Android device (which has gotten a lot of use) has been my phone (an LG G2, then G4, then G5). UPDATE: I ended up returning the iPhone 8 Plus and getting a Pixel 2. There was just too much missing from iOS and the iPhone that Android had plus I was disappointed with the camera. I think the iPhone 8 is a decent phone but it's not for me (even though I use iPads). Read below for more. TIP: Don't buy mobile phones from Best Buy as they charge restocking fees. Hardware comparisons: * The G5 was much cheaper than the iPhone. * The G5 has a user replaceable battery and microSD slot. * The G5 is not waterproof but the iPhone is. * The G5 has dual cameras and one is a wide angle lens... I will miss the wide angle lens. * The G5 has fast charging and includes the needed cable and power adapter to do so. The iPhone 8 supposedly also has fast charging, but it will cost you $$$ to buy the needed cable and power adapter. * The G5 has a small color charge/notification LED which is nice. The iPhone can use the flash for alerts (General->Accessibility->LED Flash for Alerts). * The G5 photo aspect ratio is 16:9 and the iPhone's is 4:3. I *MUCH* prefer 16:9. Disappointed. * My G5 developed a focusing problem with the main camera where photos would often be blurry, which is what prompted me to start researching new phones. * The iPhone 8 Plus also has dual cameras, but no wide-angle camera... however, you get a 2X optical zoom camera and portrait mode photos which I am looking forward to. * The iPhone 8 has (slow) wireless charging but the G5 does not. * The iPhone 8 has 3D Touch but the G5 does not. * The iPhone feels like high end hardware, has a great IPS screen, and has great build quality but it's a little on the heavy side. The G5 is good too but doesn't seem quite up to the iPhone. * The glass back worries me but Consumer Reports says it is a rugged phone and survived their \"tough 100 drops in the tumbler with just some minor scratches\". iOS/iPhone negatives: * Speech recognition is not as advanced but it's not terrible either. * Speech recognition does not give you options to choose from a list of phrases of what you might have said. * I found it virtually impossible to place the cursor in the middle of a word when editing text. Very annoying. * Sometimes when I tap something it doesn't respond and I have to tap it again. This seems to happen mostly on small buttons. I didn't have this issue on the G5. * No always on display feature to show time and notifications. Many Android phones have had this for awhile, including the G5. Hopefully Apple will add this in an update as it's a very useful and convenient feature. * Can't configure bottom row of touch buttons. On Android, I had a button to quickly show and hide notifications. I found it better and faster than having to swipe down. * It seems Apple does not allow custom keyboards to access voice dictation... which means you have to switch keyboards to the standard one in order to access voice dictation. I use voice dictation a lot on my Android. * Home screen is not as configurable. Cannot control icon layout as much. * Some of my favorite apps (frequently used) are not available on iOS, like NOAA Weather and ColorNote. * You can turn on 'Reduce Motion' to limit animations that slow things down, but there are still some fades and other effects that you can't turn off. Android lets you turn off all (or almost all) \"eye candy\" animations for a faster phone. * Sharing photos to Google Drive made me always select the same folder (it didn't remember the selected folder). iOS/iPhone positives: * Frequent iOS updates. This is a big deal compared to most Android phones. * Easier to communicate with other people who also have iPhones (and there are a lot of them). * Can say \"Hey Siri\" to access Siri even when phone is laying down idle and without touching it. * Better security (so I've read). * Good integration across iPhones and iPads. * I like the way that news is integrated. So I returned the iPhone and bought a Pixel 2 because I like Android better when it comes to phones (although for tablets I use iPads). I really like the Pixel 2 but the LG G5 was great too although it did have some significant disadvantages (like updates). Pixel 2 notes: * It was very easy to connect my LG G5 to the Pixel 2 using the included cable to transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. There's also an included adapter in case you need it. Unfortunately I was disappointed that my alarms did not transfer and I had to re-enter them manually. I also had to re-arrange the icons the way I wanted. * The Pixel 2 screen and phone itself are a little smaller than my G5. I'd like a little larger screen like the G5 has but then the phone would be larger and weigh more so it's a trade-off. * No bloatware or crapware (especially the type you can't uninstall)!!! YEAH! And guaranteed 3 years of updates! These are BIG advantages of having Google phones. * So far the camera is impressing me. It's definitely better than the iPhone 8 Plus camera. I will still miss the wide angle camera on the G5 and the native 16:9 aspect ratio but portrait mode and the overall photo quality makes it much easier to forget. UPDATE: I noticed a quirk in portrait mode processing that didn't apply the blur properly around someone's hair... hopefully that will be improved/fixed. * Can turn off animations - I like to do this to make the phone feel even faster: https://lifehacker.com/disable-animations-on-android-to-improve-performance-1583554900 * The phone seems very fast, even when it was installing a bunch of apps in the background. It's the fastest and smoothest phone I've ever used. * The sound form the front-firing stereo speakers is best I've heard from a mobile phone. * I wasn't too happy there was no headphone jack, but I was pleasantly surprised that the headphone adapter seemed to be less intrusive than I anticipated and I am pretty certain that the sound quality through the adapter (which has a DAC in it) sounds better than my LG G5. I'll probably pick up an extra adapter or 2 (they are only $9 each) but are out of stock right now in the Google Store. Good audio video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pi_SykMCsI * The always on display looks great with OLED, and this is a really nice feature that you don't get on iPhone. * I like that you can change icon shapes (square, circle, \"squircle\", etc.). * I found out my mobile data wasn't working. After a few hours researching and messing with stuff, I ended up having to use a new Tracfone SIM and getting my service transferred to the new SIM. * The Pixel 2 has a 'Now Playing' feature that listens to any music that's playing nearby and tells you the name and artist (even on the always-on display), but I'm not sure how practical it is. By the way, it works without mobile data and WiFi and without sending audio to Google. UPDATE: I went to Target and my phone was identifying the background music Target was playing. Pretty cool, especially if you've ever wondered what a song is that was playing. * Fast charging is great (especially when you need it), and the Pixel 2 includes a beefy fast charger. * I really like that Google increased the warranty to 2 years. With the extra 24 months I get with my credit card, that gives me a 4 year warranty. Too bad it doesn't cover accidental damage though. * The Google Assistant is tops when it comes to brains (smarts), and can be activated with a squeeze or by saying 'hey Google' or 'OK Google'. Pixel 2 Android disappointments (could be rectified with Android updates): * No battery life indicator on the 'always on' display (my G5 had this and it was useful). * My LG lets you customize the navigation bar but the Pixel 2 doesn't without a little \"hacking\" it seems. I really liked that I could add an extra button to pull down the notifications. Maybe they will add this in Oreo 8.1. * There is a double-tap feature to check your phone but unfortunately you can't double tap it to turn the screen back off (my G5 had this too)... this one is kind of nitpicky though.", "review_comment_count": "", "review_rating": "4.0 ", "review_posted_date": "31 Oct 2017"}, {"review_header": "amazing phone seller overpriced!", "review_id": "R3MFZ9YP291CCA", "review_author": " Luke Milner", "review_text": "Amazing phone but the seller charges $30 more than the Apple store just go there to get it plus the warranty is better and you can always add Apple care if you choose! make sure to follow if you find reviews like this helpful!", "review_comment_count": "", "review_rating": "4.0 ", "review_posted_date": "06 Oct 2017"}, {"review_header": "Dead phone after 30 days.

If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). The price: There seems to be this running idea that a $1,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phone's are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly $2/ a day on a contract with Verizon. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was $850. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there. What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.", "review_comment_count": "", "review_rating": "5.0 ", "review_posted_date": "07 Nov 2017"}, {"review_header": "Iphone X: A complete re-design and leap forward for Apple.", "review_id": "R1ENG94TAPGZ3N", "review_author": " V12 Vantage", "review_text": "Everyone reading this is probably familiar with the Apple phone line up so I am going to focus on the differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 7 plus specifically. First off, the set-up process has been significantly streamlined. When setting up your new iPhone X setup will ask you if your old iPhone is nearby, select yes, and you can wireless transfer all your apps, settings, backgrounds, passwords, etc. to your new phone in a few clicks. I really appreciated this streamlined process and it was incredibly quick and easy to transfer all my settings to my new iPhone X. The other main features that have been upgraded are as follows: New screen (5.8\u201d OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple) - Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. (See comparison images attached of the iPhone X versus iPhone 7 Plus). - OLED Screen offers deeper blacks and brighter whites resulting in greater color reproduction. - Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly. - The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. I thought this would be annoying but Apple has cleverly used the screen real estate on both sides to include the time, date, battery indicators, etc. Farewell Touch-ID, Hello Face-ID - Face-ID is Apples new facial recognition technology which has replaced the finger printer reader and home button in order to free up additional screen real-estate. This is new and only available on the iPhone X. - Apples facial recognition is light years ahead of Samsung or any other carrier. I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom. - I was worried this feature would be inconsistent or frustrating but it has worked really well. The only time it is a bit more inconvenient is if the phone is sitting on your desk or a flat surface you kind of have to lean over a bit or angle the phone towards you to unlock it. - This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything. - This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background. Additional noteworthy features and changes: - The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions. - Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images. - Increased audio quality and volume - Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market. - Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design. - Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing. - In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone). Bottom line, the iPhone X is another smash hit from Apple. Every feature people were concerned about turned out to work flawlessly as usual. I have only had the iPhone for about 24 hours so it is early to leave a long-term focused review but so far the new iPhone X has lived up to the hype. The iPhone X may not revolutionize the smart phone industry but it is a welcome upgrade to the iPhone which designs were getting a bit dated. I am excited about Apples new strategy to release a flagship model and allow the new features to trickle down to next generation\u2019s phones. If you have the money to spare you won\u2019t likely be disappointed. My only complaint is the phone only comes in 64GB or 256GB basically forcing users to pay an extra $150 to get decent storage. Further, the beautiful glass back on the screen feels fantastic and has a great weight to it. However, a replacement screen will cost you $275+ and the back glass replacement is rumored to cost around $400. Essentially a single drop could result in a $700 repair bill. Unfortunately this means most phones will be shielded in a case and will not be enjoyed.", "review_comment_count": "", "review_rating": "5.0 ", "review_posted_date": "06 Nov 2017"}]}, {"asin": "B01MQHADBT", "name": "Lenovo Premium Built High Performance 15.6 inch HD Laptop (Intel Celeron Processor 4GB RAM 500GB HDD, DVD RW, Bluetooth, Webcam, WiFi, HDMI, Windows 10 ) - Black", "ratings": {"2 star": "8%", "1 star": "26%", "4 star": "13%", "3 star": "11%", "5 star": "42%"}, "url": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQHADBT", "price": "$298.00", "reviews": [{"review_header": "I'm satisfied.", "review_id": "R2INQTIJTXIYYL", "review_author": " LooziAnna", "review_text": "I've had this laptop for a few months now.

It\u2019s only about $150 to buy, runs a full copy of Windows 10, hardly weighs anything, and has a nice keyboard \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t exactly have the highest-end specs. The Lenovo IdeaPad 110s is the budget follow-up to last year\u2019s 100s. This time they\u2019ve upgraded from an Intel Atom processor to a full Celeron, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard flash storage. You still have the basic plastic shell body, 11.6\u201d 1366x768 TN screen with poor viewing angles, but decent quality straight on, and the full fold-out-to-flat hinges. But this time you get lower battery life, which is kind of a bummer. This is a laptop that\u2019s perfect for a super budget school or travel writing laptop, but nothing more. The Intel Celeron processor, while likely to handle multitasking a little better, doesn\u2019t really bring any new performance over last year\u2019s model. In fact, the laptop scored lower on Google\u2019s Octane benchmark than the 100s! It is worth noting that Octane is being retired by Google. Also last year\u2019s model only came with N wifi, which is much slower than the current generation AC wireless standard. The new 110s has AC, though it\u2019s only a 1x1 antenna. The 110s has a responsive and comfortable keyboard for long typing sessions. No numpad, but keys are appropriately arranged and spaced out for its size. Very easy to use. The screen is still nice and crisp for working in word, Google docs, or web browsing. But you won\u2019t get a ton more out of this machine. No Photoshop design work, no video editing, nothing like that. The webcam is trash. The speakers are on the bottom. They\u2019re stereo this time, instead of last year\u2019s mono, but they\u2019re not great. This time, the whole computer is just white. This is, theoretically, a more aesthetically neutral position to be in, but the solid white keyboard and hand rest are bound to start turning colors and looking pretty gross after a few months. I would not look forward to that. As far as media consumption goes, this is actually a pretty good machine. Via USB 3.0 external hard drive, I was able to smoothly play back 4k 60fps video files, 1080p 60fps video files, and a full raw BluRay rip MKV in the native Windows 10 Movies app with no hiccups. 8k proved to be a bit much for it, though. On YouTube, I was able to play back 1080p60, 1440p, and 4K with no dropped frames. But there are still plenty of moments when the computer becomes unresponsive or just downright sluggish to use. It\u2019s a little Celeron with a mere 2GB of RAM - and that can only do so much. Now, you do have a full copy of Windows 10 on here, which adds a little flexibility over something like a Chromebook or something, and I feel it may be one of the last of its kind with Windows 10 S coming soon. If you\u2019re looking for a sub-$200 laptop for basic office work, web browsing, and media consumption - the Lenovo 110s might be for you.

It's wireless works well: youtube videos played quite well even with another program running in the background. Downloaded programs installed quickly as did programs installed from DVD. Speakers are adequate yet audio quality was better than average using good headphones connected to the headphone/microphone jack. Unit runs cool; battery life is decent (3+ hrs?)--and the battery is replaceable. A SSD would further increase run time on battery power. The mouse pad is decent. What's not to like about this entry-level model for so little $?! Sure, I'd have liked a lighted keyboard and more stylish case, but I can hardly expect these features at this price point. All-in-all, so far I'm impressed with this laptop's value, features, respectable performance for everyday tasks for such low cost.

I hadn't even thought about buying it online but it hit me one day to look on Amazon and I am SO glad that I did. The pricing for the exact same product here in store (and without tax!) is CHEAPER. I saved SO much money buying this Macbook here on Amazon and I do NOT regret this purchase one bit! I DID think about it a lot and read every last review and looked at all the product pictures (which were all good) and I'm glad to say that I also got a BRAND NEW PACKAGED BY APPLE MACBOOK AIR 13.3 INCH LAPTOP! It was sealed shut in the original Apple packaging brand new! Everything is running smoothly, no problems whatsoever (though I am VERY nervous of leaving a scratch or something on it so I bought a rubberized case & carrying case to keep it safe & looking new!) NOW, though the product title DOES say that it comes preinstalled with EL CAPTAIN (or whatever), mine already came with the SIERRA update. It had Sierra Version 10.12.3 and in the app store, you can update it (FOR FREE) with the May 2017 recent Sierra 10.12.5 update! IF yours comes in with EL CAPTAIN, you can update it FOR FREE to the 2017 Sierra update - do not worry! Lol. Now I don't see any CONS to this laptop (for ME anyway) but here are my PROS: - Editing is smooth -Battery life is AMAZING. It also charges fast! - Love the simplicity off this laptop! -Everything runs smooth and is simple to access (unless you're coming from windows,etc) - The design - The backlight on the keyboard & apple on back - The screen (which a lot of people complain about but there's nothing wrong with it? Pst picky people!) - Loading screens are quick - Love how it connects to my phone and i can facetime and imessage - Size is perfect - Love how slim and thin it is though I'm sometimes afraid I might drop it lol - Usb ports/sd card slot (This laptop will forever be Apples BEST laptop. Why did they take basically ALL of the ports off of the Pro's?) - Light gaming runs VERY well (for hours) with no problems or restarting & resolution is perfect (I play Sims 4) - There's enough space - Continues to get the latest updates - Magnetic charger (also love how the charger light indicates if it's charged or not) Anyways, there's A LOT that I love about this laptop.

I ordered this for school purposes. I have used mac products before and I am impressed with this one. I am not a computer guru, but I know my way around both mac and windows. Pros: -Brilliant display. It's very bright. The keyboard is lit so that helps with late night homework. - Easy to learn and navigate. Even with non-apple products. I downloaded word and it works great on this mac, as does PowerPoint. - Lightweight. This thing is so easy to carry. In my undergrad I had a traditional laptop, and it was so heavy to carry on campus. I have this one in a small sleeve and it is very easy to transport back and forth. - Quiet - this thing does not make a lot of noise when typing. The key stroke isn't as deep, so the click isn't as loud, which is nice when you're in class taking notes. - Excellent sound system - its speakers are clear and LOUD. Great for when you just have to have an impromptu dance party while making dinner with your kids :) - Good battery life - I use this thing daily, and have to charge it about once a week, maybe twice a week depending on how much late night surfing I'm doing. - Fast - it has great processing time. I'm constantly taking pictures on my phone and airdropping them to the MacBook Air (what can I say, my cloud is already full!). It takes literally seconds for this thing to download 35+ pictures. - it has a USB port still. The newer MacBook Pro does not, which would drive me nuts! Cons I will say it can be a bit cumbersome to use the pad. I like a traditional mouse better, but this is easily resolved by attaching a wireless mouse (which I have for this computer - thank you USB port!)

But, having regretted getting the first gen MacBook Air, I decided to wait. I was concerned about two things: the relatively slow core m processor, and the lack of ports. Before you complain that a lack of ports on a very portable machine shouldn't be a problem, I agree, and it wouldn't be except for one thing: Apple's SuperDrive, which is one of the better outboard optical drives in build quality and performance, hogs USB ports. That is, it won't work through any vendor's USB hub. It only works when plugged directly into a USB-A port on the computer, or when plugged into the single USB-A port on any of the adapters that Apple sells for MacBooks with USB-C ports. It has nothing to do with power (though it does require more power than many hubs supply); it's actually a restriction that Apple support has confirmed to me. So if you like your SuperDrive and want to plug it into your MacBook, no other USB device can be plugged in at the same time. This is a fairly serious restriction. At least the recent MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports, but the 12\" MacBook still only has one. And it's not even a Thunderbolt port, so say goodbye all of your Thunderbolt and Firewire peripherals, no way to use them with this computer (which has always been the case with the 12\" MacBook). BTW, other optical drives work fine on a USB hub, so the port-hogging nature of the SuperDrive shouldn't be a deal-breaker for anyone. Other than that annoyance, I ordered the BTO/CTO version of this MacBook directly from Apple with 16GB memory and the core i7 processor to upgrade from my mid-2014 MacBook Pro with a core i7. I'm very pleased to say that the performance of this new computer is very snappy - I haven't been able to notice any difference between this and the MacBook Pro. I'll be running some performance tests with Xbench and will report back if/when I have a chance, but if you were waiting until a fast enough MacBook 12-inch notebook showed up, this is the one (provided you shell out the extra cash for the core i7). Oh, and don't forget to order that $69 USB-C AV Multiport Adapter. Update 2017-07-05 (see new update - \"glitch\" caused by sleeve!): Beware hardware glitches! After using this for a few weeks, I've discovered a couple of annoying features, one of which might cause me to remove another star, but I'm not ready to do that just yet. The first thing is that this new MacBook, like the latest MacBook Pro models, no longer has the famous Apple \"loud zen\" chime on startup. It's totally silent. This is because it boots (or wakes) automatically when you open the lid, so, for whatever reason, Apple considered that there was no point in having the startup chime. This is mostly not a problem unless, for example, you're trying to reset PRAM (now called NVRAM), where you'd like to hear a chime or two before releasing the magic keys. But the second thing is much more serious, which is that on my unit, the internal switch that detects that the lid has been opened (to boot or wake it) is faulty, and doesn't always work. You can open and close the lid all you want and press the power button 'til the cows come home, but it's not going to work. I found that if I tap it just right, it will free up the switch and work fine. I'm currently traveling and brought it to a Genius Bar and they couldn't find any fix, even after completely reinstalling Mac OS. When I get home, I'm going to open another problem case and ask to have it replaced. I'll report back here if there's anything noteworthy to report on. Update 2017-08-28: After a lot of testing, I finally determined that the \"flakey lid switch\" was being caused by the protective sleeve that I use when traveling: Incase ICON Sleeve with TENSAERLITE for 12\" MacBook - Heather Gray/Black - CL60649 . This sleeve has a magnetic closure that somehow causes the magnetic reed switch in the lid and base to stick in the \"closed\" position. If you tap the MacBook just right, it will free up. As long as I don't put it in the sleeve, it always works fine. I need to do more testing to see if the direction that I insert the MacBook in the sleeve will have any effect, but reed switches are like this, and it's not a defect in the MacBook. Even though there doesn't seem to be any problem, I still feel that this computer really needs more expansion capability and a Thunderbolt 3 port would've been a much better choice than simply a USB 3.0 type-C port. So I'm not going to give it five stars, yet. Maybe, as components get smaller, a future MacBook will have that, at which point this will be a near-perfect product.", "review_comment_count": "", "review_rating": "4.0 ", "review_posted_date": "15 Jun 2017"}, {"review_header": "Huge bang for the buck", "review_id": "R3EEGRWTGX7KPQ", "review_author": " Ken Warner", "review_text": "I bought this for my wife for her birthday to replace her old, clunky laptop.
