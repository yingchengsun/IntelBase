So yesterday I had an appointment to go over the results from an EMG test I had a week ago.  The doctor wasted no time telling me that the results were not good.  He said I fall in the severe category and said that we would need to perform carpal tunnel release surgery.  I use a manual wheelchair and my hands are everything, so he&amp;#39;s recommending we do one hand at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need some advice.  Have any of you had this surgery?  It&amp;#39;s a minor surgery for most people, but not for wheelchair users like myself.  After a few days your average person can return to work with restrictions and not applying more than 5 pounds of pressure with your hands.  Good friggin luck with that if you&amp;#39;re in a wheelchair.  I can&amp;#39;t even get out of bed, get dressed, and go to the bathroom without applying more than 5 pounds of pressure.  My biggest concern and question revolves around recovery time.  I have almost 5 weeks of vacation and sick time saved up at work.  BUT I&amp;#39;ve been saving that time for when my girlfriend gives birth to our child which is going to be any day now.  I saved this time off for our baby, I don&amp;#39;t want to burn through it recovering from surgery.  Blunt question: is it realistic to hope that I can take 10 days off and do the absolute minimal amount of activity possible to give my hand 10 full days of rest and then expect to start applying some more pressure so that I can perform my daily duties?  Or is that beyond realistic?  How was your recovery?  How long was it before you could start to use your hands in a normal manner?  These are my biggest questions.  If I can take it easy for 10 days or so and expect to start doing some normal activities, I can swing that.  I realize my hand is not going to be 100%, I&amp;#39;m not dumb.  I just need something more than 5 pounds of pressure.  If I&amp;#39;m looking at 3 weeks of not being able to use my hand, I&amp;#39;m boned.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very independent.  I&amp;#39;m a paraplegic and I use a manual chair.  I work full time, drive myself, and do lots of other activities throughout the day.  I also live in the northern part of the united states where we already have snow.  Trying to push yourself in a wheelchair through snow and only apply 5 pounds of pressure?!  Forget about it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That, and like I said, my first child is about to be born.  I don&amp;#39;t want to have a bum hand for when my girlfriend goes into labor.  I also want to be able to help her take care of the baby when they&amp;#39;re born.  I want to be able to enjoy it and not be worrying about not being able to perform even the simplest of tasks for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctor said he would recommend having the surgery sooner than later.  He said if I wait too long it can get worse and I risk causing permanent damage to the nerves and muscles.  I asked another surgeon on Reddit and they were surprised that the doctor said this as it can take years for any further damage to be done, if any at all once you reach a certain point.  This opinion varies from person to person.  With so much going on in life right now I&amp;#39;m considering holding off on the surgery.  All of my friends with kids are shouting, &amp;quot;Get it done now so it&amp;#39;s out of the way before your baby gets older and requires more care!&amp;quot;  I just got this news yesterday and my mind as been all over the place.  Get it done?  Wait?  How long is the recovery?  Just all sorts of questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So again, if any of you have had this surgery, can you give me some insight into how your recovery went?  It would be greatly appreciated.

By the end of 1997 she had further been diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease, Osteoporosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia. Despite this, she never once faltered in being the most amazing Mom I&amp;#39;d ever known. Within a year I had been utterly devistated, my Step-Dad said we had to stay with our neighbors while he went to pick our Mom up; he said she had gone to spend a few days with our Aunt. As we saw his car pull up into the driveway, my brother and I couldn&amp;#39;t contain our excitement and took off as fast as our little legs could take us. As a child you can feel the shifts in the air that most adults seem to loose but as a kid, these feelings can be overwhelming. Without knowing why I halted, grabbing my little brother by his arm to stop him too. Our Mom was in the back seat, she didn&amp;#39;t look right and her head bobbed as if it weighed a 100 lbs. My Step-Dad, crouching down, pulled our Mom out of the back seat and an image that forever haunted my nightmares emerged. Both legs were entirely wrapped in ace bandages from her toes to her hips. Whatever had happened left the bandages stained in dark blood and in some spots it dripped in thick globs on the concrete below; the sound was horrific despite being almost inaudible. Our Mom looked up at us from his arms, drained and medicated. Waving and smiling she said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay sweethearts, Mommy will be okay. I will heal. I love you both.&amp;quot; Being the big sister, I&amp;#39;ve always taken my role seriously and I&amp;#39;m very protective of my little brother. Instinctively I picked him up, trying to shield him from what was in front of us. The veins in my Mom&amp;#39;s legs were dying, they had to do an emergency surgery to remove and then replace what they could. By the time they were done she had over 600 dissolvable stitches on the inside and over 755 on the outside - yes that was per leg! When my Mom found out that my Step-Dad had lied to us after she told him not to, she was infuriated because she saw the devastation and fear on our faces. Shortly after this, for us kids, what seemed out of nowhere, we were looking for another place to live and my Step-Dad wasn&amp;#39;t coming with us. Our home had been built from scratch, my Mom designed its interior and now we weren&amp;#39;t allowed to live in it anymore. Confused, our Mom told us that things weren&amp;#39;t working out between them and they were getting a divorce. I can&amp;#39;t recall once hearing them argue and neither can my brother but at the time, we believed that it was mutual and accepted our fate. Years later I found out my Step-Dad had actually filed for divorce before the surgery on her legs but since she wouldn&amp;#39;t have insurance once the divorce was finalized, he agreed to hold off but he barely waited for her legs to heal before he packed our bags for us. I came home from school to find my birthday present, a Golden Retriever named Bandit, and our family cats, missing; he told me they ran away because I left the back door open as well as the side gate but the truth was he had gotten rid of them. Less than 3 days later my Mom&amp;#39;s good friend and her 2 children were living in our home while we were hoping to find somewhere to live, meanwhile we were living in our car. Still to this day my brother has no idea that his Dad had cheated on our Mom or that his explanation for doing so was, as he put it, &amp;quot;because he didn&amp;#39;t marry her for her to become broken goods.&amp;quot; My Mom, throughout all of this, didn&amp;#39;t want to tarnish her son&amp;#39;s relationship with his Dad. Despite all efforts though, his Dad neglected him anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our Mom never once showed the heartache she felt as a woman or the fear she had as a Mom. Instead, regardless of the daily agonizing pain surging through her body, she found a job at a local small casino, got us an apartment and made sure her work schedule allowed her to never miss a moment of our lives. When she got home from work, we were just waking up for school. She&amp;#39;d make us breakfast and as we ate she&amp;#39;d make our sack lunches. She always took us to school as she always picked us up. After school my Mom had a 30 min cool off rule. For 30 mins we could do whatever we wanted, it was her way of giving our brains a break but not a big enough break that we&amp;#39;d grow lazy, unable to restart our brains for homework. Throughout the week she&amp;#39;d take us swimming, to the park or on an adventure. Then she&amp;#39;d help us with our homework, make dinner and get us ready for bed, spending alone time with each of us. Roughly 2 hours after we&amp;#39;d go to bed, she would head into work and start all over again when she got off. In general that&amp;#39;s amazing enough but to do all this without ever showing her children just how much pain she was in, fighting daily against her body that showed signs of slowing, in my opinion, is 1 in a Billion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over 10 yrs ago I became my Mom&amp;#39;s full time caregiver and I have no regrets with my decision. By doing this I not only prevent a stranger caring for her but I&amp;#39;ve also allowed my brother to have a normal life, one where he doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about his Mom&amp;#39;s needs being fulfilled. In the last few yrs my Mom&amp;#39;s health has deteriorated for the worse, progressed by the constant harassment, discrimination and verbal attacks of our previous landlord who made it very clear of their disdain for disabled people. According to them, &amp;quot;Disable people are the vermin of humanity and should be treated as such.&amp;quot; For nearly 3 yrs we received 5 Day Pay or Quits although we had never been late on rent, requests for multiple months of rent at a time, multiple eviction threats, bogus complaints for impossible things we could never have done. We were denied lease renewals, service dogs, all animals in general, reasonable accommodations, maintenance requests for over one year. Every time we fought back our landlord retaliated - they threw away her medial documents and then threatened eviction if we didn&amp;#39;t replace them by their deadline for breech of contract, they placed a 23 y.o. drummer above us and in exchange for playing as often, as loud and as long as he could in hopes of making us move - his rent was lower over $80.00 while ours was raised an additional $71.00. Whenever they felt like it they illegally entered our apartment, would call to slander my abilities to care for my Mom, ignored the police and refused to help us even when it meant endangerment to my Mom&amp;#39;s health. The result was her first seizure which lead to countless more and now her brain is permanently damaged. Her back locks up for hours at a time, leaving her incapable of moving or being touched. Her body spasms so badly you can physically see the muscle quivering under the skin and tightening into knots. Her insomnia lasts for days at a time now and when she does sleep, the pain is so bad she&amp;#39;ll sleep for less than 2 hours at a time. Never having depression before, she now crys uncontrollably at times that don&amp;#39;t make sense. Anxiety and stress have weakened her defenses. While sleeping, she now has what the doctors call Stressed Induced Self Mutilation meaning her arms are now covered in horrific scars, scars she&amp;#39;s so embarrassed about that she stopped wearing her favorite clothes. The deterioration of her muscles and bones mixed with the undeniable damage caused by their neglect has left my Mom in a constant state of agony and to make matters worse, with her illnesses and medication she has lost all of her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Mom is the most beautiful person this world has ever known and it kills me that because of what&amp;#39;s happened she doesn&amp;#39;t smile like she use to, her laughter is seldom and when it does occur, it&amp;#39;s cut short from the pain it causes. Her day consists of laying in bed surrounded by pillows, cold bottles and hot pads while she endlessly moans, unable to find any relief. I want my Mom back. I know that what&amp;#39;s happened is irreversible but there is a surgery the doctors and her insurance, to an extent, has approved. Unfortunately though I have to come up with a large amount of cash to pay for the co-insurance before the doctors will operate and because I&amp;#39;ve spent the last 10+ yrs taking care of her, I have no friends to support her GoFundMe Campaign. I was hoping someone in here could give me advice on how I can get the campaign funded. Daily I post it on my only social network, Facebook but even then most people ignore it. I&amp;#39;m genuinely afraid if I don&amp;#39;t get this money together and get this surgery for her I&amp;#39;ll never see the Mom I&amp;#39;ve always known again. I&amp;#39;m afraid that the pain will overwhelm her past the point of her seemingly never ending internal strength and one day we&amp;#39;ll loose her all together. I&amp;#39;ve never understood why good people are given such horrible lives while heartless people have more than they&amp;#39;ll know what to do with and refuse to share. My Mom is my hero and I want to be hers too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re wondering why I let my Mom live in a situation where her health was at risk, it wasn&amp;#39;t by choice. I don&amp;#39;t get paid for what I do. My state is the hardest state to get family caregiver pay. Yes the government has programs that offer free outside caregiver assistance but it&amp;#39;s limited and for the time I&amp;#39;d be working, my paychecks would be going to pay for the additional time I would need to make a difference. We survive on less than what an average teenager makes at a minimum wage job at less than full time hours. By the time we&amp;#39;re done paying all of the bills, none of which are for cable, internet or miscellaneous expenses, we have roughly $220 for groceries for the two of us and our two service dogs for 4.5 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please advise me on how I can save my Mom. I&amp;#39;ve called all the organizations that offer any form of assistance and none of them, in my state, can help with this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "In 1996 my Mom was diagnosed with what was once known as Stage 2 Multiple Sclerosis.

My mom is not retired, or disabled, and very much alive, so we are getting a lawyer to help us, but I want to know if anyone in a similar situation has gotten SSDI on a parent's record?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hcwpn", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Has anyone else had success getting SSDI on parent's record?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hcwpn", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/7hcwpn/has_anyone_else_had_success_getting_ssdi_on/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512368843.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/7hcwpn/has_anyone_else_had_success_getting_ssdi_on/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "chronicallyhangry", "created_utc": 1512340043.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;---I am not on SSI/SSDI but i was seen by a doctor at the social services office and he said my mental disabilities (ptsd/depression anxiety) prevent me from working and he signed a medical waiver exempting me from the work program (&lt;em&gt;meaning I am considered disabled for the next 12 months&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My condition is so severe that I am unable to function and do normal things like cook and clean for myself.

This in addition to all the aches &amp; pains that plague me on a daily basis.  \n\nAnyway, my parents do not understand or sympathize AT ALL.

I never posted on reddit before either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suffer from anxiety, gender dysphoria, serious emetophobia, and depression as a result of either my GID or because I was abused in the past, i.e. physically and mentally. I am a happy person most of the time. I don&amp;#39;t lose interest in things. The only times that my depression seems to trigger is when really bad things happen or stressful things, such as feeling overwhelmed by bills and not being able to accomplish anything after trying really hard to do so. I haven&amp;#39;t had a suicidal attack in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had mixed reviews on how to treat my depression. Some of the doctors that looked at me say I should be on medication even though the treatments I had in the past only made me very suicidal, sick, and attempted suicide from said medications. They didn&amp;#39;t bother looking at my ten to twenty years of mental and physical abuse at all or anything else. I felt like that they did not care that the reason why I&amp;#39;m depressed is because I&amp;#39;m poor and suffer from abuse (either irl or online with people calling me a gorilla, an ape, etc.) They felt that my GID was just a &amp;#39;phase&amp;#39; and that I should be admitted in the high risk ward. They felt that my Emetophobia was a joke and that I should get a &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; job. I was admitted once and not only did they transfer me out, but then said nothing was wrong with me because I didn&amp;#39;t start fires or didn&amp;#39;t suffer from something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other doctors say that I should take extensive therapy and eliminate the triggers in my life. That I should get medication as a last resort since a lot of my stress and issues come from my GID along with being physically and mentally abused from my family and other people for years. I had went to therapy and the therapist said the same thing, that most of my issues are coming from my GID and too much stress/not being able to handle stress. She was transfered and I haven&amp;#39;t been back in years. I want to go back but I don&amp;#39;t have any money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My triggers are my family whom think and feel that I&amp;#39;m a girl, constantly put me down, and living in the state I&amp;#39;m in because the person(s) who attacked me are living here. I want to go to another country or go to another place but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to do this. I haven&amp;#39;t had a job in seven years. The only work that I am doing is on call at convention centers (help staff.) I suffer from anxiety not from crowds or working with others but from the sense of failure or letting my boss down. Like today I felt like crying because they were pressuring me to memorize information and I could not do it no matter how hard I tried. I felt like I would fail even though I was asking questions and getting help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no finanical help outside of myself. All of my friends (online only) either have similar or worse problems than me or are all underage/don&amp;#39;t really care in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to work but there are problems. My emetophobia prevents me from getting many jobs (and I get motion sickness and is prescribed medication,) and I get panic attacks/anxiety at the thought of it. To the point of blacking out for minutes to hours. I haven&amp;#39;t had a job in seven years even though I constantly looked for work all those seven years. So there is a gap of nothing outside of my on call job which prevents me from working. I do not have a college degree. I do not have any major skills (trade/etc.) that I excel at. I mostly have good typing skills (not number pad,) persistance (if that is a skill) computer knowledge, and open to learning information and doing things without complaints. That&amp;#39;s it. Outside of barely rusty and bad Japanese/Spanish I do not know any other languages besides bad English.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it easy to live in the UK? To get disability in the UK if I have doctor medical information from the USA?

I am a happy person most of the time. I don't lose interest in things. The only times that my depression seems to trigger is when really bad things happen or stressful things, such as feeling overwhelmed by bills and not being able to accomplish anything after trying really hard to do so. I haven't had a suicidal attack in years.\n\nI had mixed reviews on how to treat my depression. Some of the doctors that looked at me say I should be on medication even though the treatments I had in the past only made me very suicidal, sick, and attempted suicide from said medications. They didn't bother looking at my ten to twenty years of mental and physical abuse at all or anything else. I felt like that they did not care that the reason why I'm depressed is because I'm poor and suffer from abuse (either irl or online with people calling me a gorilla, an ape, etc.) They felt that my GID was just a 'phase' and that I should be admitted in the high risk ward. They felt that my Emetophobia was a joke and that I should get a 'real' job. I was admitted once and not only did they transfer me out, but then said nothing was wrong with me because I didn't start fires or didn't suffer from something more serious. \n\nThe other doctors say that I should take extensive therapy and eliminate the triggers in my life. That I should get medication as a last resort since a lot of my stress and issues come from my GID along with being physically and mentally abused from my family and other people for years. I had went to therapy and the therapist said the same thing, that most of my issues are coming from my GID and too much stress/not being able to handle stress. She was transfered and I haven't been back in years. I want to go back but I don't have any money.\n\nMy triggers are my family whom think and feel that I'm a girl, constantly put me down, and living in the state I'm in because the person(s) who attacked me are living here. I want to go to another country or go to another place but I'm not sure how to do this. I haven't had a job in seven years. The only work that I am doing is on call at convention centers (help staff.) I suffer from anxiety not from crowds or working with others but from the sense of failure or letting my boss down. Like today I felt like crying because they were pressuring me to memorize information and I could not do it no matter how hard I tried. I felt like I would fail even though I was asking questions and getting help. \n\nI have no finanical help outside of myself. All of my friends (online only) either have similar or worse problems than me or are all underage/don't really care in the first place.\n\nI want to work but there are problems. My emetophobia prevents me from getting many jobs (and I get motion sickness and is prescribed medication,) and I get panic attacks/anxiety at the thought of it. To the point of blacking out for minutes to hours. I haven't had a job in seven years even though I constantly looked for work all those seven years. So there is a gap of nothing outside of my on call job which prevents me from working. I do not have a college degree. I do not have any major skills (trade/etc.) that I excel at. I mostly have good typing skills (not number pad,) persistance (if that is a skill) computer knowledge, and open to learning information and doing things without complaints. That's it. Outside of barely rusty and bad Japanese/Spanish I do not know any other languages besides bad English.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nIs it easy to live in the UK? To get disability in the UK if I have doctor medical information from the USA? How would I go about housing?\n\nIs there another country outside of the USA that I can live where disability wouldn't be a problem?\n\nWhat information do I need in order to do this?\n\nSorry if my English is bad.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "7b1dvw", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Need advice on getting disability out of the USA", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1509926746.0, "link_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7b1dvw", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/7b1dvw/need_advice_on_getting_disability_out_of_the_usa/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1509955169.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/7b1dvw/need_advice_on_getting_disability_out_of_the_usa/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Belzoff", "created_utc": 1509926369.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "7azdx6", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I\u2019m 29, disabled and almost exclusively bed-bound.

A lawyer thought I had a &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; at disability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have Graves Disease. It was &amp;quot;anxiety&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tachycardia&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;unexplained weight loss&amp;quot; for years after lots of specialists sort of agreed that was it (no drug use, no eating disorder, no heart/lung problems, no brain disorders, etc). But then my vision suddenly got bad (as I was driving &amp;quot;suddenly&amp;quot;), and I couldn&amp;#39;t see to drive down the street hardly. Saw doctor, and finally was diagnosed Graves (now 5 years ago); labs concurred (in a big way). In fact I have had to have labs way too often (every few weeks some years; at least monthly other times). I tried RAIU for RAI, but halfway through week-long process, they stopped treatment (RAI) because labs suddenly came back &amp;quot;euthyroid&amp;quot;. Insurance said I responded well to medications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a lot of work, I got down to tiny dose of Tapazole with good diet. By then, I had a few other physical issues (must wear Rx dark glasses with bifocals because of first TED, I guess some &amp;quot;eye nerve&amp;quot; damage I don&amp;#39;t understand; I get these Rx eye drops when eye tissue starts getting &amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; to prevent protruing eyeballs/TED; womb issues managed with low dose b.c. and a little Vicodin, 20 Vicodins a year does it because I can&amp;#39;t take opiates that well). Xanax from years ago for anxiety (which was probably Graves, but I was always in ER for panic attacks, and psychiatrist settled on Xanax after many other pills for anxiety. Same dose for years now, and yes I know it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;hated&amp;quot; but it helps quality of life. Been on those since 2008 except self-taper once, and hospital put me back on.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This summer I was working and thought I was doing great, but had completely unexpected thyroid storm. I thought it was heart attack but I wasn&amp;#39;t anxious so no Xanax. At some point, I felt dipped in lava (they put ice blanket on me in hospital, gave me fentanyl in IV and kept increasing it because it hurt really bad and bp was higher than I knew it could get, like 220/180, and I&amp;#39;m a normal 130/70). They couldn&amp;#39;t control my heart rate or bp: tried removing things from IV bag, and alarms went off, so they said &amp;quot;hidden heart attack&amp;quot;. I barely remember it all but I passed out at work and was transported to ER after EMTs did some stuff in ambulance for a long time; I remember that embarrassment but they were nice. At hospital, I was thirsty but they wouldn&amp;#39;t let me drink for hours. I was finally diagnosed with thyroid storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And apparently being around certain chemicals triggered it (or stress; I think it is a big guessing game). But they said I almost died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Endocrinologist and doc both were upset, though my labs had been fine weeks earlier. Endo increased my Tapazole to unheard of levels, and anyway now I can&amp;#39;t get job. I get very far into interview processes (even 3 month background check for some college position), but then suddenly, no contact. Not even nicest people. At first, I thought they found somebody more suitable, but it became a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;; always happened. I started trying to get waitressing jobs then (no experience), and barista, and lots of jobs: I was blackballed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I sort of look sickly: I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;6 (pushing 5&amp;#39;7&amp;quot; hard) and 100lbs, but I try to hide it with clothes. I was model and as kid, &amp;quot;naturally skinny&amp;quot;, but I put on weight after having kids (up to a 20 bmi). Now I&amp;#39;m back down in the 16bmi range. I force feed (on phenergan and now melting zofran so I don&amp;#39;t throw up phenergan so I can force feed). I do easy yoga to not hurt &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; (had done intermediate poses for years, but went to PT for pain, and was told &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; was too strong, causing womb-area pain). I have avoided all surgeries (like fibroid removal) so I wouldn&amp;#39;t need painkillers (or have scars inside: endometriosis? That runs in family, so I want to avoid &amp;quot;cutting&amp;quot; down there.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Graves makes you feel like superwoman. But having hard time controlling this &amp;quot;bout&amp;quot; (that&amp;#39;s been going on since June, though my labs are &amp;quot;hypo&amp;quot; (artificially I think) because endocrinologist overdid Tapazole. My heart rate flies up high even on increased propanolol; I had to get another stronger dark glasses Rx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in 40s. I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; disabled all this time, but today priest said take long hard look at self and see what others see. My CV and resume don&amp;#39;t matter if I get dizzy doing sit-down work at computer with dark glasses, or heart rate goes up doing mild physical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently tried changing doctors too, because old doc (with me since I was healthy) is &amp;quot;too close to situation&amp;quot; and feels guilty about my loss of abilities (unable to put on weight, eat, see well, control heart rate, definitely can&amp;#39;t control labs). But new doc saw &amp;quot;Xanax&amp;quot; on meds list (and probably vicodin) and assumed I was &amp;quot;doctor shopping&amp;quot;. I was not; I&amp;#39;m returning to old doctor now. I changed because old doctor is &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; and I had hard time seeing him feel guilty about missing diagnosis (which is NOT easy diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New doctor seemed like nice lady, but I guess she saw my meds and wasn&amp;#39;t honest about where she was sending me (not to &amp;quot;psychiatrist&amp;quot; to try different anxiety meds &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, but to substance abuse people because she saw &amp;quot;xanax&amp;quot; on meds list. When I called to change schedule, they admitted they weren&amp;#39;t real &amp;quot;psychiatrists&amp;quot;, but rather substance abuse people. I said I had real physical problem, and generally don&amp;#39;t like dishonesty. If lady doc thought I had drug problem, why not say that? I have mounds of paperwork showing doctor visits and all the stuff they tried; I have no &amp;quot;red marks&amp;quot; of even early refills; I follow directions so I can &lt;strong&gt;stay alive.&lt;/strong&gt;) So that new lady doc is gone, and I will go back to old doc. He&amp;#39;s getting new doc in practice anyway who might not feel &amp;quot;guilt&amp;quot; if I have thyroid storm again. (Which I&amp;#39;m trying hard to avoid. My skin still hurts just remembering the physical pain from &amp;quot;dipped in lava&amp;quot; feel of storm this summer.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyway, maybe this last episode (the thyroid storm) took its toll on me. I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m taking two nausea pills twice a day: zofran melty so I don&amp;#39;t throw up phenergan, and phenergan. All so I can force feed a piece of toast or some rice, and anything with protein to put on weight; juice for vitamins. But sometimes just to keep pills down at all, then some soup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am housewife who just started trying to work again (though I got W-2s from husband early in marriage as &amp;quot;exec assistant&amp;quot;). And I feel &lt;strong&gt;real guilt&lt;/strong&gt; for thinking, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot; But really there are times I&amp;#39;m not sure I can even drive (super-dizzy, probably heart rate). Doctors can&amp;#39;t seem to control thyroid, can&amp;#39;t find heart issues, and other options (thyroidectomy), surgeons don&amp;#39;t want to touch either due to weight (I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;really thin&lt;/em&gt;) or they think it could make my vision much worse (which boy, I want to &lt;strong&gt;avoid!&lt;/strong&gt;. I can see &amp;quot;like normal&amp;quot; with dark glasses/bifocals).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Endocrinologist had said she would set me up for RAI attempt #3, but then she gave me too much thyroid blocker and her partner on-call was horrified when labs looked like I needed opposite of Tapazole: Synthroid. That partner helped me a lot because it was night, and I was shivering bad, cycling from hot to cold, and yet still taking meds as prescribed (high doses Tapazole). That partner said stop taking it at all, and walked me through some &amp;quot;unorthodox&amp;quot; steps to feel better that night. My regular endocrinologist went off the grid (never returned calls, even when I said I didn&amp;#39;t know what meds I should be taking), but I see her next week. (Unless she cancels again.) Maybe that was her &amp;quot;unorthodox way&amp;quot; of killing thyroid, but I still have Graves (and symptoms, including stupid high heart rate). And no &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; dose change \u2014 I went back to minute dose so I wouldn&amp;#39;t thyroid storm, because making me &amp;quot;hypo&amp;quot; artificially just hurt my chances of RAI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But bottom line is, I don&amp;#39;t think they can control my thyroid. Best chance I had at RAI (which some doctors don&amp;#39;t like to do at all if you have had TED/eye involvement) was wasted this year (nuclear medicine said my orders for RAIU were &lt;strong&gt;revoked&lt;/strong&gt;, though I have paper from endo saying she ordered RAI). &lt;strong&gt;\u2014And I&amp;#39;m still not suing&lt;/strong&gt; (though endo&amp;#39;s partner suggested it: I don&amp;#39;t think my endo is too popular in her practice).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked to lawyer today about disability a little, and he&amp;#39;s all over it. I&amp;#39;m not, but I do need to plan ahead just even to pay some bills, I guess. It&amp;#39;s been almost a decade with &amp;quot;anxiety&amp;quot; (Graves), and I guess I admit my doctors, even with frequent labs, have a clear struggle keeping my numbers good. (Forget new doctors: that was a huge mistake. I am not drug seeker. I could easily get drugs others can&amp;#39;t, but &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/strong&gt; Last psychiatrist wanted me on more Xanax + Ativan; gynecologist tripled my Vicodin though I still don&amp;#39;t take it. I know I&amp;#39;m physically addicted to Xanax because when I forget it, I wake up in night &amp;quot;anxious&amp;quot;, but I certainly don&amp;#39;t need to &amp;quot;seek&amp;quot; when doctor will &amp;quot;give freely&amp;quot;.) Plus, new doc said she is &amp;quot;uncomfortable&amp;quot; with thyroid disorders. Wish she would have mentioned that sooner, like when I said &amp;quot;I need doc who can help me manage &lt;strong&gt;thyroid&lt;/strong&gt; disorder.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have questions. Like, what if I get better? I know it&amp;#39;s been 10 years and I probably won&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;get better&amp;quot;, but do you pay disability people back? Can I volunteer or do something &amp;quot;limited&amp;quot;, if only to get out of house? I don&amp;#39;t want judge telling me I&amp;#39;m lazy or anything; I&amp;#39;m not. I can&amp;#39;t control heart rate, or labs, or thyroid, ...when I tried using heat pads for paid in lady areas, I got strange burns inside and THAT&amp;#39;S why gynecologist said &amp;quot;take the stupid vicodin&amp;quot;. (I take a part of one for pain, &lt;em&gt;rarely&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, do they even DO disability for Graves &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;? (I was told Graves +anxiety, yes.) I live in Virginia if that helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl/dr: 10 yrs Graves disease, work-related thryoid storm this summer and now I can&amp;#39;t get work; see doctors ALL the time, they can&amp;#39;t control my Graves.&lt;/strong&gt; Surgery and RAI look &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; because they threaten vision worse. Never thought about disability, and IFFY on judge telling me I&amp;#39;m lazy or something. Also docs have had me on Xanax and Vicodin (I barely take pain stuff though) for almost 10 years, before diagnosis. Don&amp;#39;t want to be called drug addict either when it was all legally prescribed. Not even sure how disability works, but am starting to accept I MAY not be able to work &amp;quot;regularly&amp;quot; (if at all, sorry, it&amp;#39;s embarrassing to me because I know people are a lot worse off just looking at thread titles. But lawyer and priest think I should try so I can pay some bills. Sadly, doesn&amp;#39;t look like I&amp;#39;m getting better.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My priest is the one who got me to \"open up\" about this today.

I can't control heart rate, or labs, or thyroid, ...when I tried using heat pads for paid in lady areas, I got strange burns inside and THAT'S why gynecologist said \"take the stupid vicodin\". (I take a part of one for pain, *rarely*.)\n\nAlso, do they even DO disability for Graves *really*? (I was told Graves +anxiety, yes.) I live in Virginia if that helps.\n\n**tl/dr: 10 yrs Graves disease, work-related thryoid storm this summer and now I can't get work; see doctors ALL the time, they can't control my Graves.** Surgery and RAI look \"out\" because they threaten vision worse. Never thought about disability, and IFFY on judge telling me I'm lazy or something. Also docs have had me on Xanax and Vicodin (I barely take pain stuff though) for almost 10 years, before diagnosis. Don't want to be called drug addict either when it was all legally prescribed. Not even sure how disability works, but am starting to accept I MAY not be able to work \"regularly\" (if at all, sorry, it's embarrassing to me because I know people are a lot worse off just looking at thread titles. But lawyer and priest think I should try so I can pay some bills. Sadly, doesn't look like I'm getting better.)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "7a9hlx", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Do I really have a disability?

He&amp;#39;s slowly getting there. He has hypothalamic damage also, which was caused by a mild stroke. He lacks balance and coordination due to it and they tested him for lack of vision, but we see possibility of his vision improving. He can&amp;#39;t regulate temperature as a side effect. His hippocampus has malfunction which leads to problems with short term memory and overall hormonal development. It is the source of growth inside and out, and his does not allow the messengers he needs. Spatial disorders and processing information, look into it, it is very interesting on neural growth and processing. He has an underactive amygdala and has been slow developing reflexes and cannot make choices or process survival.\nThere is much more to it but I don&amp;#39;t want to wall you with text. You can ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Him: There were pregnancy complications and they expected a disability. He was stunted in the womb, then after C section he was very unresponsive. He passed vitals and there was nothing to declare him dead, but he was very shy to sensory stimulation and lacked reflexes. He would not respond to light or touch or sound, seemed lifeless. He started gaining reflexes at 4 years old, they were fully developed at 6. He was fed through Mickey tube and was in a weird state between coma and consciousness. He was hospice ridden and they didn&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d make past 6 but he&amp;#39;d have his moments where he&amp;#39;d wake up or move his eyes and curl his feet and jerk, so we felt horrible about the idea of not giving him a chance and we continued getting treatment for him. He passed two types of APGAR six months ago and his brain was fully conscious, five months ago he actually kept his eyes open deliberately for moments at a time, and four months ago, scans began showing growth in his brain, so they knew he was taking in information. He has the mannerisms of a baby, he has two infant reflexes and he has the need for suckling so he loves his knuckle and Medicpro pacifiers. He uses the NUK size 5 and 6 bottle nipples for formulas. We use the Convaid Cruiser stroller and Carrot carseats, which can upgrade to support him until he is 125 lbs. He is physically stunted, has gastrointestinal and muscular deficiency that he drinks prescribed formulas for, he cannot support his head or limbs so we are very gentle, he has no teeth but has ten calcium spots in his gums so we are praying. But he is a big ball of love, he loves being held close, he doesn&amp;#39;t have hate for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He loves being held over our laps, with his head supported. He loves falling asleep over husband&amp;#39;s chest in my husband&amp;#39;s recliner. He sometimes gets stubborn and won&amp;#39;t go to sleep in his stroller unless we put the hood down and drape a blanket over it. He enjoys fighting sleep and being a pouter just as much as he loves snuggling. He&amp;#39;s an attention hog. He knows he&amp;#39;ll get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now his eyes are open at least 10 hours a day, give or take, which happens in intervals of every couple hours.. the rest of the time he is sleeping or chilling with eyes closed. We&amp;#39;re starting to be able to tell if he is asleep.. when awake or half-there, his eyes will be closed with more seal and his toes will curl or fingers will move a little, but when he is asleep his eyes will be draped shut and his face is more relaxed, and sometimes he&amp;#39;ll make sucking motions right before he starts sleeping. He chills in his special needs seat/lounger with his eyes closed and curling his fingers and toes, it&amp;#39;s his career.

While the condition affects my whole body, most of my fractures have been in my legs.

Puerto Rico. As most of you know we got side swiped by hurricane Irma and completely obliterated by hurricane Maria. Right now over 80% of the island is without electricity and less than 50% have running water, telecommunications are now slowly returning to my area. Im posting this using my neighbor generator and WI-FI The relocation thought has been in my mind for a long time, even before this mess. Many Puerto Ricans have been jumping the pond for decades looking for a better future. People always tell me tell me that I should move, but just the thought and the complexity of starting a new life in a completely unknown place always scared me and my parents away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But things have changed, PR never was big in accessibility even thought its required by law, if they do something they do the bare minimum. Sadly I don&amp;#39;t see things getting better. In the island we don&amp;#39;t have all the benefits that the US have, most notably SSI. And that&amp;#39;s the main reason of this post. I want to be independent and I know I can do it with the right tools, I&amp;#39;ve been reading and goggling for the past few nights and I think I can make it work. Probably.

Talk to your doctor.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have hemaplegic cerebral palsy affecting my right side. I did a type of fasting diet called the Fasting Mimicking Diet and afterwards my cerebral palsy suddenly got a lot better. I did it wrong in April (I drank coffee, which I subsequently learnt is discouraged) and then I think I did it right in May. It was after the May cycle that the sudden improvement in my symptoms took place.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people behind the Fasting Mimicking Diet are Dr Valter Longo and his team in the gerontology lab at USC Davis. (There may be other collaborators I&amp;#39;m unaware of.) They have done a lot of research on fasting after finding many interesting effects in animal models. They developed a five-day diet plan that mimics the effects of fasting while still allowing some food, which is called the Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD). Fasting isn&amp;#39;t risk-free and having some food makes it safer. A lot goes on during fasting. One of the effects they found was an increase in stem cell production.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, it seems likely that the stem cell increase contributed to my sudden and dramatic improvement in May. Of course, I can&amp;#39;t say for certain, but as I said, I have &amp;quot;mild&amp;quot; hemaplegia on my right side and, three days after ending my fast, I realized over the course of a few hours that I was suddenly able to use it to:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;twist the top off a toothpaste tube&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;stand a ruler up on its edge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;pick a crumb off of a table&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;write legibly, when before I could only wedge a pen into a badly made fist&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;hold a mug of water by the handle and carry it about while walking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;tilt the mug to bring the water to its edge without spilling a drop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are examples, none of which was I able to do before. It is too profound a change to be the placebo effect. Or, if it is the placebo effect, it is a new and wonderfully effective placebo, hitherto undreamt of in its usefulness, so in a certain way, who cares?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I have made slow but steady further progress. I have been doing the FMD about once a month, but this rate of progress makes sense if the main bottleneck now is weakness and tightness from years of under-use, rather than something more susceptible to the workings of the diet. So, I don&amp;#39;t know if the palsy is entirely gone or not, but even if everything stayed exactly how it is now, it&amp;#39;d still be far better than before. At any rate, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure by now that it&amp;#39;s not a weird transient phenomenon. More recently, I have started stretching my hand more consistently and I can snap my fingers, although the snap is not reliably crisp.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if everyone (or anyone) with cerebral palsy will see the same effects as I have, but I really want to know. And should it work for cerebral palsy, it may work for other brain injuries. A version of the diet has already seen some success in a trial involving people with multiple sclerosis, so there is potential for autoimmune issues, and mouse models suggest it could be a powerful adjunct to chemotherapy. Furthermore, there are many biomarkers it improves in relatively healthy people. A lot of people might benefit from the diet, if they can do it safely.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this end, there does exist a packaged meal plan for the FMD, called Prolon. Dr Longo was involved in developing Prolon to make it easier for people to use the diet, but I believe he has taken steps to avoid a financial interest in it. I didn&amp;#39;t use Prolon, but the website has information which can answer some questions you might have. He has said that it is possible for a dietitian to devise a form of the diet in consultation with a patient.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, this all originated in research begun with things like starved yeasts, so for me it is a stark example of why basic science is important.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please be very careful in how your approach this.

In February 2016, I dropped out due to a death in the family that led to major depression and eventual admittance into a behavioral health hospital in July 2016. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After not being able to find work for over a year, in January of 2017, I applied for SSI disability for major depression. I then came up with the bright idea that I should join the national guard. When my recruiter asked if I&amp;#39;ve ever been treated for any mental health issues, I told him my story. He then of course told me that it&amp;#39;d be an AD and to lie on my app if I wanted to get in. So I took his advice and made it seem like I was in perfect health. I then went back to the ssi office to have my application removed from the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was flown out for basic training May 2017. I got injured in the 2nd week. I was flown back July 2017 with an uncharacterized discharge. The whole reason I left for the military is because I was going to become homeless soon as my mother was getting rid of the house. Now I am bouncing from house to house, living w people I&amp;#39;ve found on Craigslist. I just got a job 3 weeks ago but the shifts change daily and usually you don&amp;#39;t get more than 20 hours a week. Most I&amp;#39;ve made in a week after taxes is $128 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now that shits hit the fan, I decided to go back to the ssi office and reapply for disability due to depression. However, I only listed my current job because a) they ask if you&amp;#39;ve ever held a job since the condition started (i listed as February 2016) that payed more than $1130/month. Military payed $1400/month but I only received that pay 2 months and my projected salary for 2017 is only $4500, and thats including the job i have now. And b) I don&amp;#39;t know if stating that Ive had major depression since before I enlisted will come back to bite me in the ass somehow... &lt;strong&gt;So should I list my time at basic training on my ssi application, even though I am applying for depression that was occurring prior to my enlistment? If I do, will my application be denied for making too much money during basic training? If the military finds out I lied on my initial entry app, what will happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I am considering applying for an upgrade to my discharge because I received a service related injury that led to my separation while at basic. &lt;strong&gt;But will they ask any questions about if ive previously applied for ssi disability? And even if I upgrade the discharge can I recieve benefits if reason for separation is listed as &amp;quot;condition, not a disability&amp;quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**tl;dr?:** skip to bolded questions at the bottom.

SSDI allows you to live and received benefits outside the USA with the exception of a few countries.\n\nI am aware you can receive SSDI outside of the USA.\n\nTwo factors involved in the consideration of moving are a much lower cost of living,rent food etc and decent health care (lots of older expats in country with health care issues)  I do like the hospital/doctor I recently had an appointment with while in Thailand.  I paid of pocket for a specialist including a 30 day supply of medication and it cost me under $20USD.\n\n If I decide the make the move, I will of course notify SSA immediately. I do wish to continue receive payments into my US bank account.  Its easier for me and not difficult to have access to while outside the USA.\n\nI know there is a yearly questionnaire to complete while outside the USA that is different than a CDR.

I&amp;#39;ve been talking to a girl with cerebral palsy over the past few weeks. She lives with her parents and is unable to work or drive. She is also on disability. It was going well and we were talking about meeting and then poof! She stopped contacting me over a week ago so I contacted her sister and found out that she is grounded from electronics for a month. My suspicion from things that she said is that this is because she hasn&amp;#39;t been &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; on her cp. She has depression and anxiety which has really affected her motivation.

Right now I&amp;#39;m in information gathering mode. I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intend to make a decision based on what people say on the internet, rather I&amp;#39;m looking to get information from those in wheelchairs, and maybe have longer conversations with a few individuals, about a decision we need to make in the future regarding our 7 month old son.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, context: Our son (Hunter) was born with several issues, but the one we&amp;#39;ve just learned more info on, is his bi-lateral hip dysplasia. We found out recently that his legs are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; badly formed that he is going to need to endure years of surgeries, likely across the country from where we, and our supportive family, currently live, and even more years of intensive physical therapies if we want him to ever have the chance to walk. Let me also say here, that he is not currently in any pain or discomfort, I&amp;#39;ve never seen a happier little guy in my life. In addition to this, he has already endured two jaw surgeries for a malformation there, and also has a surgery to repair a cleft-soft pallet coming up. His official condition is Pierre-Robin Sequence, an suspected but unofficial diagnosis of Femoral-Facial syndrome for those interested. That&amp;#39;s all the context, now onto the question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we are faced with the decision: Do we sacrifice of a good portion of his childhood, in the hopes that he may some day walk on his own two legs, (no guarantee either) or do we say he&amp;#39;s better off having a childhood and working with a wheelchair for his life. We have been told so far, that this isn&amp;#39;t something we can put off (looking into that though) and that his growth is essential to the process working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me say, I&amp;#39;m not asking for opinions on the decision itself. What I&amp;#39;m asking is, for people here who have lived their lives in a wheelchair, what are the difficulties, the challenges, and hurdles that life has posed to you? If you had the option of giving up 5-7 years of your childhood, and going through what I&amp;#39;ve talked about to walk would you? If it meant not being close to family? What challenges and problems do you deal with in your daily life that I, as someone who has walked his entire life, could not possibly be aware of? Trying to get outside of ourselves here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we have about a year to a year and a half before the ball really gets rolling, so we are taking our time, and trying to ask the right questions of the right people. We appreciate any insight you might have, either through your own observations, or your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also posted in &lt;a href=\"/r/wheelchairs\"&gt;/r/wheelchairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Good day to everyone, \n\nHopefully I'm in the right place to ask this question, if not please feel free to direct me to another sub, and thanks in advance for your time.\n\nLet me first state that I'm not looking for someone to make this decision for me. Right now I'm in information gathering mode. I do *not* intend to make a decision based on what people say on the internet, rather I'm looking to get information from those in wheelchairs, and maybe have longer conversations with a few individuals, about a decision we need to make in the future regarding our 7 month old son.\n\nFirst, context: Our son (Hunter) was born with several issues, but the one we've just learned more info on, is his bi-lateral hip dysplasia. We found out recently that his legs are *so* badly formed that he is going to need to endure years of surgeries, likely across the country from where we, and our supportive family, currently live, and even more years of intensive physical therapies if we want him to ever have the chance to walk. Let me also say here, that he is not currently in any pain or discomfort, I've never seen a happier little guy in my life. In addition to this, he has already endured two jaw surgeries for a malformation there, and also has a surgery to repair a cleft-soft pallet coming up. His official condition is Pierre-Robin Sequence, an suspected but unofficial diagnosis of Femoral-Facial syndrome for those interested. That's all the context, now onto the question.\n\nSo we are faced with the decision: Do we sacrifice of a good portion of his childhood, in the hopes that he may some day walk on his own two legs, (no guarantee either) or do we say he's better off having a childhood and working with a wheelchair for his life. We have been told so far, that this isn't something we can put off (looking into that though) and that his growth is essential to the process working.\n\nLet me say, I'm not asking for opinions on the decision itself. What I'm asking is, for people here who have lived their lives in a wheelchair, what are the difficulties, the challenges, and hurdles that life has posed to you? If you had the option of giving up 5-7 years of your childhood, and going through what I've talked about to walk would you? If it meant not being close to family? What challenges and problems do you deal with in your daily life that I, as someone who has walked his entire life, could not possibly be aware of? Trying to get outside of ourselves here.\n\nThankfully, we have about a year to a year and a half before the ball really gets rolling, so we are taking our time, and trying to ask the right questions of the right people. We appreciate any insight you might have, either through your own observations, or your experiences.\n\nThanks!\n\nAlso posted in /r/wheelchairs", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "6znse4", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Question - Wheelchair life", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 13, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1505231392.0, "link_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6znse4", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6znse4/question_wheelchair_life/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1505259948.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6znse4/question_wheelchair_life/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "W0lfpack89", "created_utc": 1505231148.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the case for me.

But discrimination the special ed system is something not often discussed. I am a former special ed student at the New York City Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in a self contained classroom full time from kindergarten until 10th grade. For many years NYC didn&amp;#39;t have part time special education classrooms where you spent part of the day in a in a general ed classroom and part of the day in a special ed classroom. You were either in a special ed classroom full time or not at all. My elementary school had 550 students average, and there were 5 teachers per grade. There was one special education teacher per grade. They didn&amp;#39;t have co-teaching classes, or a part time self contained classroom. My diagnosis was &amp;quot;Specific Learning Disability&amp;quot;. The IDEA says students with disabilities must be educated in the &lt;em&gt;least restrictive environment&lt;/em&gt;. This is hardly LRE. I know kids with more extreme issues who are &amp;quot;mainstreamed&amp;quot; (I hate that term).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of 9th grade I went to a general ed class for 1 class for 2 weeks. They wanted to see if I was ready for general ed. In the end of the year they decided I was ready for general ed. At the end of the year the guidance counselor called my mom to ask for permission to put me in general ed. My mom said yes, but isn&amp;#39;t LRE required by law? That&amp;#39;s like asking &amp;quot;can you give us permission not to break federal law?&amp;quot; My mom told me the school wanted to put me in general ed in 6th grade. They said that they will observe me to see if I&amp;#39;m ready for general ed. They didn&amp;#39;t put me in general ed to observe me. I still can&amp;#39;t understand how they decided I wasn&amp;#39;t ready for general ed without putting me in general ed. Moreover every class I had except kindergarten had at least 2-3 paras. Not once were these paraprofessionals used to transition students into general ed classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout elementary and early middle school I had undiagnosed selective mutism. I would not start a conversation at all. I didn&amp;#39;t tell the teacher that the girl behind me was kicking me with her umbrella, never asked to go to the bathroom. In 4th grade I went to a program where you stayed 37 1/2 minutes after school. One time I ran out of loose leaf so I and my teacher went searching for another one. A 5th grade girl instantly ripped a loose leaf from her notebook after hearing I needed a loose leaf. My teacher says &amp;quot;no, I want her to ask for it&amp;quot;. Instantly I was in panic and my heart started beating. I was very afraid to walk up to someone and start a conversation. I thought the teacher would notice I&amp;#39;m shy, but looking back she probably didn&amp;#39;t. in 6th grade I didn&amp;#39;t do work in a group projects all because I was afraid to ask the girl what am I supposed to be doing. The teacher could have amended this by giving us tasks, but didn&amp;#39;t. I always knew I was shy at school but not at home. When I became an adult I found out shy meant something else so I would describe my elementary school years as &amp;quot;extremely shy at school but not at home&amp;quot;. Then my friend told me had autism, selective autism and dyslexia. I heard of selective mutism but googled to find out what it was. I saw a description of myself in the results. I knew I had this problem all along, just didn&amp;#39;t know there was a disorder for it. I had 8 special ed teachers during my selective mutism years and 4 other professionals, none of identified this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In middle school I was given a para and still had one in high school. Towards the end of 10th grade I asked my mom to remove the para. There was an IEP meeting at the end of the year and when my mom said I wanted the para removed and an IEP member replied &amp;quot;the para is there to protect her in case she says something inappropriate&amp;quot; and then went on to say the para is usually not needed, but if a situation arises where I say something inappropriate and everyone starts laughing at me, the para is there to protect me under these circumstances. My mom always said they gave me a para because they were afraid for me and I would not have believed this, but I was there to hear it. I had my mom write a letter to the school saying she wants the para removed. When they called her about the letter she told them I made her write it. After 12 years of having an IEP mom still didn&amp;#39;t know how to advocate for me. Having someone follow me everywhere is embarrassing and this ruined my high school experience. When the para was absent, I would receive a substitute. A stranger following me is worse. One woman followed me everywhere, even in the locker room and wouldn&amp;#39;t leave me alone, like a stalker. However, there were 2 occasions during 11th grade where the para was absent and I was fine all day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my senior year (18 years old), we went to the computer room 2 times a week to do a reading program. Since the program was easy for me, I would finish early and then do other stuff on the computer. Since the principal came to observe, I only did this reading program. I was calm and behaved myself. I always behaved myself in that class, but the principal came to observe, so I must be EXTRA well behaved. The next day in the computer lab my para sat next to me. The principal asked why she wasn&amp;#39;t sitting next to me, even though I was doing fine on my own. Later during my senior year my senior year, my last class teacher was absent, so everyone went home because it was the last class. I too went home while my para went to the bathroom. Then the next day my friends asked me &amp;quot;Where were you? Ms. ZZZ was looking for you.&amp;quot; Then my para told me I was supposed to wait for her to come back to tell her I was leaving, because she is responsible for me and will be in trouble if something happened to me (I was 18). You can argue I shouldn\u2019t have left. But if my classmates were allowed to leave without telling anyone, why shouldn\u2019t I be? Why should I be treated differently because I have a para? During the last day of school, every senior was free to move out and about, while I had to be with my para. I was being treated different than every single senior in the school and had to follow rules &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;no one else had to follow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe these issues were a result of a lack of oversight in the special ed system.

Schools are now required to offer a full range of special education services, including part time special education.

If patterns of recommended programs in a particular school suggest inappropriate recommendations that do not seem in the best interest of students, central teams will conduct a more intensive audit of student IEPs. For recommendations that are not in the best interest of students, regular progressive disciplinary measures for school leaders and IEP teams will apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Disabled people do get discriminated against.

I need the insurance so that I can get the help I need from professionals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I still have a panic attack in my GPs exam room when she suggests I go to a counselor. I was shaking for hours after the call from my disability agent scheduling said evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m terrified of couselors. I&amp;#39;m terrified to even go to that office.

What is the evaluation looking for? (Included in the list of issues applied under is chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorder, tenativly diagnosed by my GP, likely based on the panic attack I had in her exam room.) Do they attempt to diagnose you during the evaluation? Are they able to perscribe\u200b medicine that will turn me into a zombie, and can they force me to take it by withholding my approval?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What might happen in regards to my application if they determine that I don&amp;#39;t actually have chronic depression and general anxiety disorder, but rather those things are symptoms of a larger diagnosis? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one thing I dont doubt is that they will believe me.

VA has me on pain management with morphine, nerve meds and muscle relaxers.  I take Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine for depression and additional sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m tired and just sitting and relaxing various parts of my body will jerk/spasm, sometimes violently.  It&amp;#39;s not constant like a siezure.  It&amp;#39;s more like what happens when they test your reflexes with the hammer.  Then I get a feeling of extreme calm, kind of like when adrenaline wears off.  The VA Dr told me I have RLS(Relestless Leg Syndrome), however, it just happens to affect my entire body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did a sleep study for my apnea and they said there was very little &amp;quot;RLS&amp;quot;.  But, they only hook the sensors to your legs and said they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to tell if any other part of my body was jerking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have another appointment at the VA tomorrow and thought I&amp;#39;d ask here and see if I could go in armed with a little more information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  Thank you all so much!  This has been very enlightening.  After reading up on Myoclonus I am leaning towards that as I present all the symptoms listed.  I also have a few of the symptoms of PLMD(Period Limb Movement Disorder) and I do get Hypnic Jerks, but those are completely different with respect to the symptoms I described above.  With regards to it causing me to drop things, that definitely happens.  Sometimes when I go to close around an object my hand/arm will jerk causing me to knock it over or just briefly have it in my hand.  Something that does happen several times a day is that when I go to use my mouse, my arm will jerk.

Some background:\n\nI'm 45 and disabled due to breaking my back and dislocating my hip.  Long story short, surgery, PT, etc., no worky.  VA has me on pain management with morphine, nerve meds and muscle relaxers.  I take Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine for depression and additional sleep issues.\n\nMy symptoms:\n\nWhen I'm tired and just sitting and relaxing various parts of my body will jerk/spasm, sometimes violently.  It's not constant like a siezure.  It's more like what happens when they test your reflexes with the hammer.  Then I get a feeling of extreme calm, kind of like when adrenaline wears off.  The VA Dr told me I have RLS(Relestless Leg Syndrome), however, it just happens to affect my entire body.\n\nI did a sleep study for my apnea and they said there was very little \"RLS\".  But, they only hook the sensors to your legs and said they wouldn't be able to tell if any other part of my body was jerking.\n\nAnyway, I have another appointment at the VA tomorrow and thought I'd ask here and see if I could go in armed with a little more information.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nEDIT:  Thank you all so much!  This has been very enlightening.  After reading up on Myoclonus I am leaning towards that as I present all the symptoms listed.  I also have a few of the symptoms of PLMD(Period Limb Movement Disorder) and I do get Hypnic Jerks, but those are completely different with respect to the symptoms I described above.  With regards to it causing me to drop things, that definitely happens.  Sometimes when I go to close around an object my hand/arm will jerk causing me to knock it over or just briefly have it in my hand.  Something that does happen several times a day is that when I go to use my mouse, my arm will jerk.  I haven't read up on the things listed on that page that Myoclonus can be a symptom of yet, but I'm going to.  I'll have a lot to talk to my doctor about tomorrow.

My current carer started about 3 months ago and we initially got on well. However, she has shared views with me that I find extremely offensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She frequently jokes about how gross ginger people are. At first I thought this was a joke of some sort (although I didn&amp;#39;t find it funny) so I just let it slide. Recently she talked about a girl she knows who is dating a ginger guy and how gross that is. It didn&amp;#39;t seem like a joke, she seemed genuinely disgusted by the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She frequently uses the term slut as a descriptor of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the absolute worst: She frequently &amp;quot;bitches&amp;quot; about black people she has to interact with and often makes critical remarks about Indians and Asians she might encounter when out and about by herself. Then, just a few days ago she said that she found out the father of a person is African-American and she then proceeded to shudder and say &amp;quot;they disgust me&amp;quot;. I honestly felt physically sick. I have never encountered such blatant racism and, though I know this isn&amp;#39;t about me at all, it really upset me to hear someone talk about another human being that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear to me that I probably will not be able to make this work long-term but I also know that my care situation has been so unstable lately that I currently can&amp;#39;t afford to fire her and find someone else right now. I don&amp;#39;t have the emotional resources for it (going through a period of very bad depression as a result of the instability in my care and I&amp;#39;m only just starting to find my feet) and I&amp;#39;m also physically not at my best. It would also likely impact my work and I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of disruption to that over the last few weeks so can&amp;#39;t afford that right now without risking things. So apparently this means I&amp;#39;m stuck with a racist bigot for a while, fucking yay. Thanks life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like the worst, compromising my values and my beliefs for my fucking care. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I actually am the worst because when she speaks about these things (in private, never in front of anyone else), I freeze up from how shocked I am and I just blankly look at her, completely silently. A lot of the times this happens it&amp;#39;s when she&amp;#39;s chatting to me whilst we&amp;#39;re in the middle of something (like going to the bathroom). I don&amp;#39;t know if this is just me but I find it hard to stand up to someone when I&amp;#39;m in a frankly undignified and vulnerable position - not that that excuses my silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anyway, this isn&amp;#39;t about me. This is about the fact that her views cannot be tolerated, at least not in my house. Does anyone have any ideas about how to deal with this? I think I need to have a sit-down conversation with her where I tell her I won&amp;#39;t tolerate racist or otherwise bigoted remarks under any circumstances. But is there anything else I can do that I might not have thought of? Any ideas anyone has as to how to deal with this shit?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi guys, so you've all had pretty good advice before and I wanted to get a perspective on this situation outside of my own.\n\nI'm a severely disabled young adult who has a live-in carer. My current carer started about 3 months ago and we initially got on well. However, she has shared views with me that I find extremely offensive.\n\n- She frequently jokes about how gross ginger people are. At first I thought this was a joke of some sort (although I didn't find it funny) so I just let it slide. Recently she talked about a girl she knows who is dating a ginger guy and how gross that is. It didn't seem like a joke, she seemed genuinely disgusted by the idea.\n\n- She frequently uses the term slut as a descriptor of women.\n\n- And the absolute worst: She frequently \"bitches\" about black people she has to interact with and often makes critical remarks about Indians and Asians she might encounter when out and about by herself. Then, just a few days ago she said that she found out the father of a person is African-American and she then proceeded to shudder and say \"they disgust me\". I honestly felt physically sick. I have never encountered such blatant racism and, though I know this isn't about me at all, it really upset me to hear someone talk about another human being that way.\n\nIt's clear to me that I probably will not be able to make this work long-term but I also know that my care situation has been so unstable lately that I currently can't afford to fire her and find someone else right now. I don't have the emotional resources for it (going through a period of very bad depression as a result of the instability in my care and I'm only just starting to find my feet) and I'm also physically not at my best. It would also likely impact my work and I've had a lot of disruption to that over the last few weeks so can't afford that right now without risking things. So apparently this means I'm stuck with a racist bigot for a while, fucking yay. Thanks life. \n\nI feel like the worst, compromising my values and my beliefs for my fucking care. I'm pretty sure I actually am the worst because when she speaks about these things (in private, never in front of anyone else), I freeze up from how shocked I am and I just blankly look at her, completely silently. A lot of the times this happens it's when she's chatting to me whilst we're in the middle of something (like going to the bathroom). I don't know if this is just me but I find it hard to stand up to someone when I'm in a frankly undignified and vulnerable position - not that that excuses my silence.\n\nBut anyway, this isn't about me. This is about the fact that her views cannot be tolerated, at least not in my house. Does anyone have any ideas about how to deal with this? I think I need to have a sit-down conversation with her where I tell her I won't tolerate racist or otherwise bigoted remarks under any circumstances.

I am still going to the bathroom between 6-25x daily. My body sends me signals that I'm about to shit and or piss myself at any second of every day. If it's hot out or I am walking more than 5ft my body pain spikes and tells me a bathroom emergency is going to happen. My stomach is in pain every single day, and my body now translates pain into I need to shit asap. Actually, it translates everything into that. If I need to pee, I have a bowel movement. If I eat food I can't finish eating that food without going to the bathroom in the middle of it. The kicker is I'm a receptionist/call center worker, where you really need to be at your desk all day and it's frowned upon to miss calls/call in(to any job really).. Being allotted maybe 10mins/daily for restroom time. To make everything better I've developed a new spasm... a rectal spasm. It hurts to sit, to lay down, to walk, to go to the bathroom those 5-25 x daily are fucking hell.\n\nI live in misery and am so scared of what every human around me thinks. Disability thinks I'm not sick, enough.\n\nI went from a full time job 40+ hrs/wk down to 6hrs/2days a week and I still can't make it to work everyday.\nMy paychecks went from 1200-2000 down to 150-300. My household financial needs sits around 2k/month.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore.\nMaxed out family's wilingness to help out.\nGetting the \"grow up\" talks when I am grown the fuck up and do everything in my power to be okay.\n\n\n**My disability was denied, I'm not sick enough.**\nFamily says try going through \"The Advocator Group\" and keep trying for disability.\nThey say everyone is denied a few times unless you have stage 4 cancer.\nPsych + Therapist agreed I should be able to get disability with my tags (chronic anxiety, chronic depression, ptsd, agoraphobia)\n\nDisability said TLDR:\nYou clearly have some issues but you're not sick enough.\n\nSo I guess I'm wondering... Am I wasting my time with disability?\nThis crazy manic depressive/anxious obese girl who can't stop shitting herself like a scared dog... Do I need to force myself to step it up and get back into working? Do I keep trying?\n\n\ntldr;\nconstant stomach pains brought on by \"physical manifestation of stress and anxiety\" for 5+yrs due to chronic anxiety, chronic depression, ptsd, agoraphobia causing me to go to the bathroom in result of pain all day, losing job after job due to attendance due to pains/problems. trying to figure out if I need to tough it out or if disability can help me, my disability was denied for not being sick enough. \n\np.s,;\nno wonder I was denied disability, \"I poop too much bc I'm nervous 24/7\" is an awful reason.

Or when do you tell and how? \nI don't have an disability which can be seen on the outside (until you spend time with me)...\nI have CMS which is kind of like MS, but it's in my nerves instead of brain.\n\nI know i shouldn't be thinking like this, but when i'm around \"normal\" healthy girls/women, i feel self-conscious and think to myself \"why would someone ever like me, when there's a perfect healthy women all over the world\" \n\nA lot of guys can say that they're okay with it, but when shit gets real and i'm laying on the floor they leave me. You guys get what i mean. \nSometimes i feel all guys want something easy and low maintenance. \n( And please, someone tell me where to get the guys! Bars? Internet dating? (didn't work out for me))\n\nOf course you can't run or hike with me or do normal people stuff.. I wonder if other guys are missing out on life when they're sitting on the sidelines with me since i cant do something.\n\nI feel like i'm slowing people down and a burden even when i'm with my friends, even though they say they don't mind, but still.. say if i'm out clubbing with them and i can't/too tired to dance they have to sit on the sidelines with me (when i know they really want to dance.)

I get lost in problematic behaviors that limit my production.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then tried microdosing LSD, 2 years ago in October.

Sadly, this time I was on buspar and saint john&amp;#39;s wort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had told the psychiatrists I didn&amp;#39;t want to take buspar, but she insisted.  I was there because I wanted to try a chemical I found on nutropics subreddit.  It was some GABA drugs, a muscle relaxer I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I did the small amount of L.

I waited in the long bathroom line because I don&amp;#39;t believe in pushing ahead of a bathroom line just because I have wheels. A bathroom is something we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; need and just because I do need the large handicapped stall, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right for me to cut ahead of ten people. (I should note that I don&amp;#39;t think less of people who push ahead of the line-- I definitely do this at Disneyland; I just don&amp;#39;t really like doing it in bathrooms as a personal preference.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I get to the front of the line and the handi stall is occupied. No problem, I just wait next to it and start telling people behind me to go on ahead of me. I wait and wait... five minutes pass and it feels like &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;. A custodian comes in to clean up after all of the sweaty women in cosplay who have used the bathroom to freshen up their body paint and I pull her to the side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Could you check on the lady in the handicapped bathroom? I&amp;#39;m worried she might not be okay.&amp;quot; I was genuinely worried. I&amp;#39;ve been in a bathroom when a handicapped woman had a medical emergency and, since a quarter of a million people attend Comic Con, I feel like the likelihood of this happening is significantly higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The custodian tries the door and it is indeed locked. She knocks a few times and there&amp;#39;s no answer. She peeks in through the crack in the stall and her face screws up into a scowl:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s on the phone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait, what?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s just sitting there on the toilet on her phone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; had to pee. I spent 6 months attached to a catheter because my bladder wouldn&amp;#39;t allow me pee on my own. I forget what it&amp;#39;s called (renal retention?) but it&amp;#39;s the opposite of incontinence and is extremely painful so, when my bladder starts to hurt really badly I freak out. I was almost at this point and this woman had been fucking off in the ONLY handicapped stall among literally fifteen regular ones in this ginormous bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bang on the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey! What the hell? I have to pee!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is literally the ONLY bathroom stall I can use! Get out!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No response.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I KNOW you&amp;#39;re sitting in there on your fucking phone! Everyone in this bathroom knows that you&amp;#39;re fucking around in there while a person in a WHEELCHAIR is waiting to take a piss!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the women in line jeer at her. She still doesn&amp;#39;t respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get the FUCK out of the FUCKING bathroom you FUCKING BITCH!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The toilet flushes. Gross. She&amp;#39;d been sitting on the toilet with her shit still in it for ten plus minutes now. There&amp;#39;s a pause as she collects herself, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The door finally opens and a 20-something woman comes out. She averts her gaze and tries to slide by everyone in line to get to the sink. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I said was a very annoyed &amp;quot;thank you.&amp;quot; I was going to just shut up and pee but when I entered the stall it was covered in the aftermath of a Cat. 5 hurricane. There was toilet paper everywhere, shit still in the toilet, and a beer on the toilet paper dispenser. She&amp;#39;d been sitting on the toilet drinking a beer and checking FaceSpace or whatever it is kids do these days and didn&amp;#39;t have the decency to clean anything up or even to double flush her waste.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the FUCK? This is DISGUSTING! What the actual FUCK!&amp;quot; I turned to her retreating form and yelled &amp;quot;You should be &lt;em&gt;ASHAMED&lt;/em&gt; for everything you&amp;#39;ve done in this bathroom you absolute abortion of a person!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got cheers from bystanders. Then I peed. Then I went and had a great day at Comic Con because nothing can ruin the best day of a nerd&amp;#39;s life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in a small bathroom with three regular stalls and one handicapped stall. It was a quiet restaurant and the only occupied stall was the handicapped one. Okay, maybe I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one who needed the extra room. Or maybe she had come in when the other stalls were occupied. Or maybe she just gravitated to that stall for whatever reason. When I was younger I used to always gravitate towards the second stall in whichever bathroom I was in. I get that people just do that. Whatever, I&amp;#39;m not gonna get bent out of shape about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s taking her sweet time, though. Again, I&amp;#39;m worried that she might have been having difficulty so I ask her if she&amp;#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m fine,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, well, I need to use the bathroom too and that&amp;#39;s the only stall I can use so...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! Hold on!&amp;quot; She flushes and comes out really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, that was fine. She was done and I could pee and that&amp;#39;s what mattered most. But then she has to add this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t you just &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; those big bathroom stalls? It feels like I&amp;#39;m in my own private suite! Hee hee hee!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Da fuque, lady?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I like them because I can get into them. I can&amp;#39;t get into any other stalls,&amp;quot; And, because I sure do have a mouth on me, &amp;quot;Maybe don&amp;#39;t use the handicapped stall if no one else is in here and a regular stall is open?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just laaaaaaaaaaaughs. And I roll my eyes as soon as she can&amp;#39;t see my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one takes the literal cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in rehab trying to get off of opiates. I&amp;#39;d been on them for 5 years (legal and prescribed because my doctor was basically a drug mill) and they were no longer helping me. I really missed being able to take a crap without feeling like I was giving birth and driving in a state that&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; considered DUI so I checked myself into the one place that would let me bring my Gameboy into treatment. Priorities!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In rehab, most people gain weight because food is plentiful and most addicts try to satiate their cravings for drugs with sugar and comfort food. My father was an addict and every time that he went to rehab, without fail, he&amp;#39;d gain thirty pounds. One of the more popular things to gorge on is pastries including donuts and cake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone brought a cake to the rehab center. A huge, frosting-heavy, cake from CostCo. It looked awesome so it had to be divided by a staff member because we were all trying to, like, eat half of the cake by ourselves. One of the larger girls grabbed two pieces and disappeared, claiming that one was &amp;quot;for a friend&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About an hour later I definitely had to pee. They make you drink a ton of water to flush the drugs from your system so everyone is pissing like racehorses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rolled on into the bathroom. The handicapped stall was open thank &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt;. I shut the door, grabbed the toilet seat cover, and discovered that the toilet was full. Of cake. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of cake. Like, holy shit, there were at least two large slice-- Oh my god. The large girl. I was mad and I had to fucking &lt;em&gt;pee&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rolled out of the bathroom and told the staff. They let me into the large staff bathroom so that I could let nature call without the really weird cake obstacle. You&amp;#39;re probably wondering why I didn&amp;#39;t just flush the cake... it was painfully obvious that the perp had tried that several times and given up. The toilet was trashed and it remained that way for TWO DAYS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was finally able to talk to the staff about it they explained that this girl had Bulimia. That sucks. Eating disorders are just the worst and I understand how hard they can be to deal with since I struggled with Anorexia as a teen. But did she need to trash the &lt;em&gt;handicapped&lt;/em&gt; toilet? There were two other toilets. She knew me. We&amp;#39;d been living in the same rehab center for weeks and it wasn&amp;#39;t a secret that the handicapped toilets were important to me. You know, for survival. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The staff said that they&amp;#39;d talk to her and asked me to stay out of it for the sake of peace. There was enough infighting drama bullshit going on in rehab and they didn&amp;#39;t want more. I agreed to let it go as long as I could keep using the staff bathroom. After they talked to her she gave me a lot of dirty looks because it was pretty obvious who had complained. But, like, maybe &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; flush cake down the only handicapped toilet? Maybe? Can we do that? Stuff it in the trash, maybe? What the &lt;em&gt;crap&lt;/em&gt;, lady.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay! Your turn!

My family didn&amp;#39;t understand and at the time I didn&amp;#39;t either. I also find  it hard to do simple things like walk correctly, tidy my home, leave my house, articulating speech,  putting my thoughts into words and going in stores or busy places but I am capable of doing this stuff most days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my main issue is that I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get into University but I&amp;#39;ve had a really hard time studying. I find academic work allot easier than my peers which helps allot but classes are like hell for me and I have the organisational skills of a 6 year old. My capabilities are also a big issue for me because people get annoyed and can only assume I&amp;#39;m being lazy. Some of my less aware tutors kept making jokes about my terrible memory and calling me out infront of everyone for my &amp;#39;atrocious&amp;#39; handwriting which really P&amp;#39;d me off. Like I would have been able to explain and try to get support if he just pulled me aside and talked to me about it and told me he couldn&amp;#39;t understand my writing. I tried dropping hints but I feel like I shouldn&amp;#39;t self-diagnose myself with such a condition and wouldn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable asking for support without a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped out during the last year of my course, which would have got me into University because I was pretty suicidal. I got offers from everywhere I applied to and wrote my application in like half an hour, so that tickled my ego a bit at least. I had been dealing with allot of personal problems, one day one of the students in my class flicked my ear. I was already having sensory overload and I had a complete breakdown and started shouting at him. He was pretty scared and I felt terrible.

My family didn't understand and at the time I didn't either. I also find  it hard to do simple things like walk correctly, tidy my home, leave my house, articulating speech,  putting my thoughts into words and going in stores or busy places but I am capable of doing this stuff most days.\n\nAnyway, my main issue is that I've been trying to get into University but I've had a really hard time studying. I find academic work allot easier than my peers which helps allot but classes are like hell for me and I have the organisational skills of a 6 year old. My capabilities are also a big issue for me because people get annoyed and can only assume I'm being lazy. Some of my less aware tutors kept making jokes about my terrible memory and calling me out infront of everyone for my 'atrocious' handwriting which really P'd me off. Like I would have been able to explain and try to get support if he just pulled me aside and talked to me about it and told me he couldn't understand my writing. I tried dropping hints but I feel like I shouldn't self-diagnose myself with such a condition and wouldn't feel comfortable asking for support without a diagnosis. \n\nI dropped out during the last year of my course, which would have got me into University because I was pretty suicidal. I got offers from everywhere I applied to and wrote my application in like half an hour, so that tickled my ego a bit at least. I had been dealing with allot of personal problems, one day one of the students in my class flicked my ear. I was already having sensory overload and I had a complete breakdown and started shouting at him. He was pretty scared and I felt terrible. I decided I couldn't deal with going back there in that state of mind. I never contacted the school after that which I feel pretty terrible about because I know there were people who would be worried about me. I'm going to get back into education and get into University somehow but I know I would just mess things up again without some kind of support so I need to work that out pretty soon.

I am one of a handful of people in the world who identifies as being neurodiverse who specializes in helping other neurodiverse individuals. \n[Don't dis-my-ability ](www.ddmacs.ca)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6pkze2", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Don't dis-my-ability", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/_OBSxELDpxFfiFq45ZCbjNbLM7ZFKQBH_-InbxW3PFY.jpg?s=43a061dbfeafb25df26e3a35cca4bf25", "width": 226, "height": 300}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/_OBSxELDpxFfiFq45ZCbjNbLM7ZFKQBH_-InbxW3PFY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=1745d34193ee6c17025601abc7a3cf70", "width": 108, "height": 143}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/_OBSxELDpxFfiFq45ZCbjNbLM7ZFKQBH_-InbxW3PFY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=b7afc709d02b0d91b739f4422b4d754f", "width": 216, "height": 286}], "variants": {}, "id": "UGYGtZEc6TbqwYsQQI4AHS30iu4IckNLUmka0t5Gboo"}], "enabled": false}, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6pkze2", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6pkze2/dont_dismyability/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1501063275.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6pkze2/dont_dismyability/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "DDMACS", "created_utc": 1501034475.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting too old and too damn tired to keep playing games with shit landlords (seriously, I always get the worse ones because of the whole I can&amp;#39;t save up more than 2 grand rule).

Each student was tasked on finding a specific book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the library I work at is painfully inaccessible. I&amp;#39;ve raised a stint about it but it always just kind of gets ignored. The building is from the 1800s and the elevator is small, super old, and looks like a death trap (but other than that it works fine). For whatever reason the building was &amp;quot;grandfathered in&amp;quot; so the ADA requirements are super minimal. Or even less than minimal. There are floors that still remain inaccessible even with mobility aids.

Some folks can have a key made for them but that&amp;#39;s if they&amp;#39;re a student or faculty.

So last year I just assumed it was a group of about 12 differently-abled students checking the library to see if it was accessible as determining factor to where they were going to apply for college, but as days passed and I saw students &amp;quot;swap&amp;quot; positions (e.g. the kid in the wheel chair was walking and the kid who was walking along was now in a wheelchair), I grew suspicious of them, but I still wasn&amp;#39;t ready to make any assumptions. Disability of course can be hidden and I know some folks who do use wheelchairs or scooters who can still walk when needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I soon learned that these students were all part of an Adaptive Engineering course tasked to see how accessible or inaccessible our building was, ways to improve accessibility to the building, and to see the challenges of what it is like to need a wheelchair. None of the kids actually had mobility issues to begin with. By the time I learned this all the students had already finished their project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a year later: yesterday a group of students in wheelchairs came to the library again, so I was outside operating a lift for six students in wheelchairs. Perhaps against better judgment, I asked one of the students walking if any of the students were actually differently-abled. She said they weren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel kind of split about this whole thing. On one hand, I think the intentions are good and important. Raising awareness for issues of accessibility is important. On the other hand, I feel very uncomfortable with the idea of people being &amp;quot;disabled for a day&amp;quot;--especially with roping me in on it because I work at the library.

Contact your examiner periodically (about every 35-40 days or so) just to see if they need anything from you.  As you continue receiving medical care, submit the records to the DDS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take some time and research the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm\"&gt;Bluebook&lt;/a&gt; listing for your conditions if there is one.

Most applicants are denied not because they aren&amp;#39;t disabled, but because their condition doesn&amp;#39;t specifically meet or equal a listing in the Bluebook.  It seems like Administrative Law Judges have more flexibility in applying the laws and regulations  and you will be able to more adequately address how your conditions affect your functional capacity to work at a hearing.  Definitely find an experienced attorney or other representative to assist with your hearing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are multiple DDS and SSA employees who frequent this sub.

I think most of these employees care about their job and strive to apply the regulations fairly. \n\n - If you are denied, please don't get discouraged.  Most applicants are denied not because they aren't disabled, but because their condition doesn't specifically meet or equal a listing in the Bluebook.  It seems like Administrative Law Judges have more flexibility in applying the laws and regulations  and you will be able to more adequately address how your conditions affect your functional capacity to work at a hearing.  Definitely find an experienced attorney or other representative to assist with your hearing.\n\nThere are multiple DDS and SSA employees who frequent this sub.  They go above and beyond helping dispel misconceptions about the disability application process and generously sharing their knowledge with applicants.  I truly appreciate the solid advice I received while working through my application process!  \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6ndkhy", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My observations about the Social Security Disability process", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 35, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1500086545.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6ndkhy", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6ndkhy/my_observations_about_the_social_security/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1500114761.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6ndkhy/my_observations_about_the_social_security/", "author_flair_text": "Optic Nerve Atrophy", "quarantine": false, "author": "B-dub31", "created_utc": 1500085961.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard &amp;quot;alternative body&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;facial differences&amp;quot; as terms to use instead of the ones I mentioned.

I&amp;#39;ve lived with very severe anxiety and life-rending panic disorder my entire life (it was so bad that I was kicked out of two schools) and know how capricious it can be so I was just like &amp;quot;yeah.

Then one lovely summer I stepped out of bed and the pain was back with gnashing teeth. I ended up being in so much pain that walking was just something I couldn&amp;#39;t do anymore. I had a wheelchair made (TiLite represent wut wuuuut) and spent a considerable amount of money tearing down my house and building a new, accessible house. Then I got better. I don&amp;#39;t know how I got better but I did and I was overjoyed. Three years passed and I fell down the stairs, fell up the stairs, got into at least three major car accidents that completely totaled each of my cars, got &lt;em&gt;hit by a car&lt;/em&gt;, and probably a bunch of other insane things that should have at least paralysed me but that I forgot about because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;ve brained my damage (not literally). Despite &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of this I walked away from each of these things a bit more afraid of the world but happy to be alive and in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was at a funeral two weeks ago yesterday. I&amp;#39;m 31 so most of the funerals are for people I knew through my mum though I&amp;#39;ve still buried five personal friends who were my age at their Time. I wasn&amp;#39;t in any kind of stress and the funeral was a lovely champagne affair that had actually been coordinated by the deceased. It was an odd feeling to know that she&amp;#39;d put this all together in her final days but, other than that, the food was good and the memories were fond. The only thing I had issue with were the stoic wooden chairs. I opted to sit outside the chapel and listen from a table in the breeze. After a while I began to feel the tingling sensation in my legs. That piqued my curiosity a bit but I let it pass me by-- I hadn&amp;#39;t had an episode in over three years and didn&amp;#39;t suspect I&amp;#39;d have another any time soon. I drank champagne, danced a bit, ate as many fruit skewers as I could get my hands on, and enjoyed the company of friends of friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day I woke up with a slight tingling in my legs. I did some stretches to loosen up and went about my day. The next day it got a bit worse. And the next. And the next. And then I was phoning my doctor in distress because I&amp;#39;d kicked all of my pain meds at the beginning of the year and had absolutely nothing to use to cope with the onset of this acute agony. He gave me some Flexeril (a muscle relaxer, for the enviably uninitiated) and told me to &amp;quot;stretch more&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;exercise in the pool.&amp;quot; I hate water. It&amp;#39;s awful. So I stretched gently at home. And it got worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks in and I&amp;#39;m back in my wheelchair. I&amp;#39;d nearly gotten rid of it when I moved last year but thought it&amp;#39;d be good to have around in case I fell down some more stairs. I&amp;#39;m very glad to have it because it only weighs 18 lbs and is far more comfortable than most easy chairs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s not fair: I&amp;#39;m terrifically accident prone and if I was ever going to end up in a wheelchair I always thought it would be entirely my own fault, not the ravages of some kind of disease. There&amp;#39;s nothing glamorous about suddenly waking up and being incapacitated. Don&amp;#39;t mistake me for thinking that being disabled by an accident actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; glamorous-- I&amp;#39;m sure it sucks just as much-- but every time I got hurt I had a cool story to go with it like that time I tried to make a jump on my bike on a very steep hill, flew off, skidded fifteen feet, peeled the skin from my forearms, and then got run over by my own bicycle as it landed mid fall. The burned CD I&amp;#39;d been carrying flew twice as far and didn&amp;#39;t have a single scratch. It&amp;#39;s been almost 20 years and I still have that thing which is great because I still love Lit and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Hell yes to the 90&amp;#39;s &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s where we come to the point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I got sick, the doctors don&amp;#39;t know what it is, and I&amp;#39;m afraid of what people will think of me for using my wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth noting that I see my couple&amp;#39;s counselor in two weeks and that I&amp;#39;ll be starting back up with an individual therapist as well. I have enough prescription meds to feed a family of five so there&amp;#39;s really nothing to add there. I think I just want to know if it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; to use my wheelchair. Sitting makes the pain better. It doesn&amp;#39;t always go away completely but when it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; it feels like effing Christmas. I can still walk around the house some, walk to the back of my car to load and unload my chair, and can even lift a few things. I worry that people will see me as weak. I worry that I&amp;#39;ll be accused of Munchausen Syndrome or something. I did have a (very unprofessional) doctor &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; me into painfully walking out of his office when he decided that I reminded him of his daughter and that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t need a wheelchair (&lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t have any nerve pain, she and I just looked alike or something. It was extremely odd). I did complain to the establishment but the emotional damage was done and I&amp;#39;m still afraid that a doctor is going to just be like &amp;quot;why are you sitting in that stupid thing? Get up. You can walk. Get up you lazy, selfish girl.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did you cope with your disability if you acquired it later in life? How did your family react? Should I feel bad for using a chair even though I am capable of being ambulatory? I&amp;#39;m so confused right now.

He used to do hiking and rock-climbing, but other than that he doesn\u2019t have any hobbies or family and virtually all his friends are his colleagues.

All these factors will of course have an impact on his work, but he is incredibly determined and quickly learning to be self-sufficient. In the end of the day the only thing that matters in his job is his mind, which works well enough. He was giving very valuable advice to my colleagues even while rehabilitating and at the very least he could remain as a consultant. We need his insight. It\u2019s normal that jobs get transformed and I am fully prepared to make any necessary arrangements and reconstructions to make working possible and comfortable to him. He can work only for few hours a week if he wants or we find another solution just to make him stay. Everybody looks forward to his return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile he feels he has become a burden to my company and he wants to retire.

He is neither first, nor the last disabled person working for me and it\u2019s about time I made the place wheelchair accessible anyway. I understand his concerns and I don\u2019t want to pressure him, but I know he still desperately longs for his work. And yet he doesn\u2019t want to hear me out. I gave him all my arguments. He keeps counting how much it would cost me to keep him employed and he is convinced he would only become a burden to me. He wouldn\u2019t. I think I am quite capable of judging that for myself. It\u2019s his retirement that would be the actual burden in this case. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems I have run out of arguments.

This is especially a challenge if you are a young person just starting out in life in the Sydney region. On the flip side, there\u2019s a large sector of young adults in our community who are just desperate to move out but are finding it nearly unthinkable due to disability and extra care they may need.

This scheme will be specifically designed around solving these two problems. The basis of the idea is simple; it\u2019s an exchange system which ensures that a young person\u2019s rent is paid for (within a contract) to be around as back up or emergency support for the person with the disability between the hours when their carers aren\u2019t working.

Some of the aspects where this scheme can positively impact the person with a disability may include the chance to be independent, to be more involved with the community, to have access to their community more easily and to have much easier access to their workplace, their place of education and other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like many other scheme ideas there are some hurdles that has arisen since this scheme started to come to light. These have included thelack of accessible and suitable rentals around Sydney, the lack of people interested in this scheme and the lack of support from the National Disability Insurance Scheme to be flexible enough around innovative schemes like this. Although there is of course ways around these issues I feel that to ensure that this concept in particular\u00a0reaches as many participants it needs and to be recognized as a legitimate scheme, I personally feel that this idea needs to be put out there and acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As well as these potential hurdles with getting the scheme off the ground, there is some thought that once the scheme is hopefully operating there may be other issues that can arise. Through the process of asking this question informally on a Facebook post, it was noted that there were some fears that could develop while the scheme is in operation; included the feeling of potential obligation to the young person to be home seven nights a week to ensure care for the person with the disability and the ethical implications in the relationship between each participant as to whether the relationship will be abused. Due to the nature and the foundations that are generally concreted into the disability industry there is also concerns around proper personal screening and Occupational Health and Safety. It is for this reason I feel that it is necessary to introduce this theory as a property established scheme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is just by looking at the amount of disability agencies, tertiary educational and youth housing services around Sydney it is clear that connections can be developed with these outlets and this idea. This especially can be considered the case with tertiary courses that are based on the health sector and have a practical component. Along with taking the opportunity to establish connections between these societies and organizations, I believe it is also important for this scheme to encourage those with the disability to invite their friends to join the scheme and live with them. By making sure this is allowed puts all participants in more control and furthers the point that this scheme needs to be participant driven and further ensure safety for all parties in this living situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another reason why it will be beneficial to have all participants in complete control over the scheme is to maximize each participants voice in saying where they want to live.

I discussed my disability with mom a few years ago, and she said she would have aborted me if she had known I was bipolar. She meant this in a manner of fact way, not in a hateful way at all. I get along with my mom just fine. Ironically, I was her only planned child. I totally agree with her. My life has been expensive and demanding compared to an able man of my age.

Our house isn&amp;#39;t suitable for mum&amp;#39;s health and dad doesn&amp;#39;t want to give her as much money anymore. She needs a house with no stairs which is cheap and most likely in a worse area then our current house. The stress of the divorce and moving house and not having enough money has put so much stress upon my mum that her health has got so much worse. I think that she is very depressed and it breaks my heart even just being around her. She is very slow and irritable and has been in a sad/bad mood for a while now. I have been out of the house a lot and I&amp;#39;ve realised that this is because being around my mother breaks my heart.

First time posting here. I know that posts similar to mine have been made, but I have some questions I&amp;#39;ve yet to see answered specifically, so I hope its alright that I make this post. It takes a lot of strength for me to write this, but I dont know what to do, and I would truly appreciate some help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a lot easier for everyone to offer their help and advice if I explained my situation first, so please bare with me, and thank you in advance for taking the time out of your day to read this. I&amp;#39;m a man in my early 20s and I&amp;#39;ve had really severe depression for the majority of my life. Major Depressive Disorder to be more specific. Additionally, I have ADHD, Asperger&amp;#39;s, and Kyphosis, but by far, the worst of these is my depression. I was diagnosed with Depression, ADHD, and Asperger&amp;#39;s at age 6, and Kyphosis around 10 years later, but I didn&amp;#39;t really feel the effects of depression until around age 12 or 13, and ever since then its only become worse. I&amp;#39;ve been to over 12 separate doctors for my depression alone, I&amp;#39;ve been taking medication for it ever since I was diagnosed. It&amp;#39;s the kind of depression that&amp;#39;s always with me every day, it doesn&amp;#39;t just come and go depending on the day, its just always there. I&amp;#39;ve only ever had one job in my life, and I did horribly at it. I missed over half of the days because I could rarely even convince myself to get out of bed. The few days I did show up I got little to nothing done as I just didn&amp;#39;t have the strength to carry myself through the tasks. The only reason I got the job in the first place, or kept it for as long as I did (about 6 months) was because my dad owns the company, and he knows how difficult it is for me handle day to day life. But obviously he can only cover for me for so long. After being fired, I basically just spent every day cooping with my depression, whether that be sleeping or just trying to focus on positive things, from then on, and still to this day, every second of every day is spent trying to fight off my depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 6 months ago, I decided to file for SSDI for my depression. I would have done it sooner, but I actually didn&amp;#39;t realize that mental illnesses qualified for it, aside from things like down syndrome and such. I listed every single doctor I&amp;#39;d ever seen for it, all the meds and prescriptions I&amp;#39;d taken, all of my work history, etc... Anyway, I submitted it and anxiously waited for a decision. Only two weeks later, I got a call from the Social Security Administration. This next part is a little complicated so bare with me...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was called, I was told I was denied due to a lack of significant work history. He advised that rather than appeal or re-apply for SSDI, I should apply for SSI instead, as that&amp;#39;s really more suited for my case. He explained that SSDI is really more for paying people who missed work due to a disability, where as SSI is for paying people who may be unable to hold a job at all, due to a disability, or just something along those lines. He then said that the SSI application was almost the same as the SSDI application, only the SSI app has a few more additional questions. I explained to him that it was actually very difficult to squire all of the proper info for the SSDI application, and that it may take some time for me to find it again (I was also previously unable to get a copy of my application after requesting one). So he said that he could transfer the info I already gave for my SSDI app to my new SSI app so I would only have a few new questions to answer this time around. He said they would call me that week to ask me for the remaining questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, I got a call that week to answer the remaining questions for my new SSI application. They started by asking me some basic questions, then I was asked for a list of doctors I had seen and all of their info. After giving them one of the doctors, I realized these were all the same questions, and that the man who called before must not have transferred the info from the other application like he said he would. I explained the situation to the woman on the phone, and she seemed to totally understand. She said she would look for my previous application, and that she&amp;#39;d get back to me within the hour once she found it, so she could then ask me what I hadnt already answered. So 1 hour passed with no call back, then 2 hours, then 3, so at that point I called them back myself and asked for the woman I was on the phone with. I was told she wasnt answering her phone, and that theyd leave a message. I called back every day for a week, and every time they would just &amp;quot;leave a message&amp;quot;. Over the weeks I kept trying to call back and explain the situation, but nobody was of any help. It eventually took so long that I got my first decision for my SSI application in the mail. It was denied due to a lack of evidence, and its because they were only given that one doctor I gave to the woman on the phone. They didnt have any of the info that the guy said he would &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my only option at that point was to file my first appeal, I think its called an administrative appeal. This time I dug up all of the info I had previously given on the SSDI application, all 12 doctors, all of my meds, history, etc... and made sure I filled out the new application properly. In the box for my comments at the end, I made sure to explain the situation as best I could. After a month or 2 went by, I was called in for an interview with someone who essentially verifies that I&amp;#39;m not just trying to scam the state out of money. Contrary to what I had read ahead of time, he wasn&amp;#39;t aggressive or trying to get me to &amp;quot;slip&amp;quot;, he was perfectly polite and over all I think I did a good job explaining my situation honestly. He told me I&amp;#39;d be getting a result within 4-6 weeks, and sure enough, yesterday, just shy of 7 weeks, the decision came in the mail. My claim was once again denied. They said they believe the first decision was correct. The thing that bothers me is that they only reviewed 3 of my doctors before making a decision. All of the doctors I have been to are completely legal and legitimate, and all of the info I gave was correct, including all of their contact info. But I dont know if they normally review all of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m really lost on what to do next. I&amp;#39;m also very scared and under stress because my parents are about ready to kick me out of the house. I have $10 to my name, no car, and nowhere else to stay. So I have a few things I&amp;#39;d really like help understanding. I know that the next step would be to file an appeal that would give me a hearing before a judge. But one of my questions is, with all of my info considered, is there even any point in appealing? Is a case of depression as severe as mine enough to qualify for SSI? I know there&amp;#39;s no harm in trying and hoping for the best, but realistically, what are the odds that I&amp;#39;m approved? I&amp;#39;ve also seen that getting a lawyer can be extremely helpful for this stage of applying for SSI, but I&amp;#39;m obviously broke. Should I try to get a lawyer? About how much does a decent one usually cost? Is payment out of pocket, or is it taken from my benefits upon winning? Should I get a lawyer before filing my appeal, or wait until I get one first. Also, how long does everything take? How long will I have to wait after I file my appeal before I get a hearing? How long after the hearing is the decision made? And if I am approved for SSI, how long does it take for that to kick in? At the hearing, am I asked specific questions, or is it mostly just me giving testimony? Is it better to bring witnesses? Is there any kind of behavior I should avoid?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any and all guidance you could give me on my situation or my questions would be hugely appreciated. Even if you took the time to read this entire post, thank you. I really hope you guys can help me through this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everyone.

There are times where I almost feel well enough to work but a single work day causes me to crash for days after. I've had to leave college because of my symptoms. I spend most of my day lying down. \n\nBasically I'm asking how can I keep a roof over my head and not starve? I also have dietary restrictions   because of ibs, fibromyalgia, and migraines, and I've found there is very little I can eat at food banks (no meat, dairy, wheat, eggs, sulfites, carrageenan, tannins, high acid foods, high sugar foods). I get that beggars can't be choosers but I sincerely cannot eat those things without getting sick/causing a flare. I'm considering applying for food stamps but since I don't have a job I'm only eligible for three months of them and I'm scared to use them up right away. I don't know how long my application will take to get processed. \n\nI feel a little hopeless but I know there must be SOMETHING I can do. Unfortunately I can't think of anything else right now. I have basically nothing to my name and am a month behind on rent. Has anyone else made it though a similar situation? \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "6haigm", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Making a living while waiting on disability", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 26, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6haigm", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6haigm/making_a_living_while_waiting_on_disability/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1497503713.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6haigm/making_a_living_while_waiting_on_disability/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "veritasviriditas", "created_utc": 1497474913.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 14}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the title said, I work at an agency for adults with disabilities.

I&amp;#39;m feeling trapped and I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do.  I don&amp;#39;t want to be alive anymore. \nI&amp;#39;m 37, I&amp;#39;ve been disabled for the past 7 years.  Medical malpractice left me in severe, unforgiving pain in my spine, in a wheelchair, and with IBD (no, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to sue).  Just before becoming disabled I was at a point where I was finally beginning to make something of my life.  I had spent the past 5 years in college working my ass off towards an engineering degree, without a break, making it my entire life, and I was proud of my progress.  Before that I wasn&amp;#39;t doing much with my life.  I was a high school dropout at 17.  I had been a musician, but didn&amp;#39;t have the opportunity to go further with it.  I didn&amp;#39;t have the money to pursue it, and felt like if I had I would be making the same mistakes I&amp;#39;d always made before, chasing dreams that would leave me penniless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to leave the small apartment I share with my sister in over a year.  It&amp;#39;s on the second floor and there&amp;#39;s no wheelchair access.  It&amp;#39;s too physically painful to go anywhere anyway.  We can&amp;#39;t move because rent has become absurd in and around our area.  We&amp;#39;re paying $1250/m for a 2 bed/1bath, and everywhere else is $1700+/m.  For the past 7 years I haven&amp;#39;t had a single friend.  I haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere but to doctors appointments.  I feel utterly alone, and I don&amp;#39;t have the energy or ability to pursue friendships.  I&amp;#39;m always too sick and in too much pain.  It&amp;#39;s not enjoyable.  I&amp;#39;m not able to sleep more than a couple hours at most in scattered minutes throughout the night.  It&amp;#39;s torture.  It effects my memory as well.  I can&amp;#39;t learn new things.\nI miss playing music so much, and would love to spend all the time I have becoming reacquainted and learning everything I can, but it causes too much physical pain to play, and my memory the way it is, I can&amp;#39;t remember anything.  I can&amp;#39;t even remember songs I&amp;#39;d written in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something I was reading today reminded me of one of my best friends from years ago.  I looked him up to learn that he&amp;#39;s now a successful director.  Under his credits is another friend from the past who I looked up, which I thought was odd because they very much didn&amp;#39;t know each other.  He&amp;#39;s in a very well known band now, quite famous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be happy for these guys, but I just feel defeated.  I feel worthless and inadequate, and I just get to sit here in an enormous amount of pain and sulk.  Exist without living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no family, no kids (which I&amp;#39;ve always wanted), no future to look forward to.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not really sure what the purpose of this post is.  There&amp;#39;s not really a solution or answer, nothing anyone could do to help.  I think I just wanted to put this out there.  I&amp;#39;ve always been a proud person, and it&amp;#39;s difficult for me to say these things.  Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for the thoughtful replies. @ &lt;a href=\"/u/kd0pls\"&gt;/u/kd0pls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/CabbageTownPatchKid\"&gt;/u/CabbageTownPatchKid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/mixedmaterials\"&gt;/u/mixedmaterials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/breathemusic87\"&gt;/u/breathemusic87&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"/u/B-dub31\"&gt;/u/B-dub31&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"/u/druminfected\"&gt;/u/druminfected&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;#39;m sorry it took a while for me to respond, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to take a break from the computer for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figure I&amp;#39;d update my post rather than reply to each comment, since what I want to say kind of relates to all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to look at the bright side, but it&amp;#39;s hard to see one.  Yes, things could actually be worse, but at that point I think I&amp;#39;d just be in a deeper level of hell.  But in any case, I think I&amp;#39;m just having some harder than usual days, and I&amp;#39;m working on clearing my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to avoid telling my Doctors that I&amp;#39;m depressed, because they get the wrong idea, and most don&amp;#39;t really understand when I tell them that my depression is situational and not a matter of mentality.  Giving me pills isn&amp;#39;t going to make me happy.  It&amp;#39;s like being physically tortured.  I&amp;#39;m not sad, I&amp;#39;m losing my mind because of the pain and daily struggle.  Yes, the thing that triggered me when I wrote the post was how I felt that I&amp;#39;ve been left behind and have no life to live or look forward to, but meds aren&amp;#39;t going to help me here, in fact they&amp;#39;ll only make my GI problems worse, which would lead to feeling worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you tell doctors that you&amp;#39;re depressed then everything, including your disability is blamed on that.  I had a doctor once tell me that the reason I&amp;#39;m in a wheelchair is literally because I had anxiety.  Like all of a sudden, even though there was that medical malpractice that caused all this, a switch flipped and I became anxious and depressed, and that caused my musculoskeletal problems, my IBD, and immune problems.  This was an MD.  He was adamant that if I saw a mental health specialist I&amp;#39;d be out of this wheelchair in no time.  So much rage felt that day that still lingers to this day regarding that visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should say that I&amp;#39;m not really jealous of the success of my peers, they were good guys and they deserve their success.  What it is, is that growing up I had a really difficult time socially for reasons I&amp;#39;d rather not mention.  Every day from grade 7 to 11 I was in a fight, and never by choice.  I was always passive, and before starting middle school I was a popular kid, but things took a turn.  I&amp;#39;d never received anything but a failing grade in any of my classes, my teachers were smug and unsympathetic, and I was pretty much thought of as someone without a future.  I found music, and I had to really prove myself and my talent.  I wanted to prove everyone wrong.  It even extended to college.  Here I was ready to transfer with nearly a 4.0 GPA as an engineering major and I have a &amp;#39;friend&amp;#39; telling me I don&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;look&amp;#39; like an engineer.  What do I look like I ask her... &amp;quot;a gas station attendant, no, not even, I don&amp;#39;t know, definitely not an engineer.&amp;quot;  She wasn&amp;#39;t even saying this in a condescending way, just a matter of fact kind of way.  This was a friend who I&amp;#39;d met in college, who arranged it so we&amp;#39;d have several more classes together throughout.  So, it&amp;#39;s not jealousy, it&amp;#39;s frustration.  I was so close to achieving success, or actually finishing something I was proud of, only to be exactly where I was expected to be.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for being able to leave my apartment, my sister and I have been looking for a new place, but living in So Cal there really isn&amp;#39;t anything affordable that&amp;#39;s going to be better.  I&amp;#39;ve looked into subsidized housing and section 8 for myself, but again, what I&amp;#39;m finding is no better.  I have a very hard time sleeping, and noise is also a major concern, and apartments here have paper thin walls and leaky windows.  Our current plan is to stay in this apartment for another 3 years and save for a down payment on a house.  Maybe by then prices will be a little more reasonable (maybe it&amp;#39;ll be worse).  It&amp;#39;s just a matter of not losing my mind being trapped here for another 3 years.  We were trying to find a better place to rent, that&amp;#39;s more expensive, where we&amp;#39;d just have to save longer in order to come up with a down payment, but houses here start renting at $2200/m.  These were houses that were $1300/m 3 years ago.  Living in long term care home, that just doesn&amp;#39;t sound like something I&amp;#39;d want.  I&amp;#39;ve thought about it before, but I feel like that setting would just add to my depression.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as being more social, or meeting someone.  It&amp;#39;s really that I&amp;#39;m always feeling sick and in too much pain.  I lost all of my friends.  They kept asking me to do things, and I kept insisting I couldn&amp;#39;t.  After a while they stopped calling altogether.  I don&amp;#39;t blame them, and I&amp;#39;m not bitter about that.  I completely understand it.  It&amp;#39;s just not enjoyable for any of us, but it means I&amp;#39;m very alone.  I want friends, but like I said, I don&amp;#39;t have the energy or ability to have them.\nI also have a problem with my immune system, so add to that the fact that I&amp;#39;m susceptible to catching every little thing that comes near, and it makes things even more difficult for me to be social, and another reason why a nursing home type place wouldn&amp;#39;t be ideal.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as work goes, &lt;a href=\"/u/breathemusic87\"&gt;/u/breathemusic87&lt;/a&gt; is right.  I&amp;#39;ve tried working, but I&amp;#39;m not at all reliable at any time of the day, and just can&amp;#39;t concentrate or be available.  Even when it comes to menial and non-physical tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/druminfected/\"&gt;u/druminfected/&lt;/a&gt;  Thanks, I do want to get back into creating music.  I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out ways I can do that without too much physical activity.  I was a guitar player.  I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about applying to a songwriting program, and I&amp;#39;m trying to find ways to mount a guitar on a stand in playing position.  Not finding anything, but I don&amp;#39;t know, maybe something could be built if I design it.  I&amp;#39;ll look into online therapy.  Might be better that way if it isn&amp;#39;t part of my medical record.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I missed anything, my mind&amp;#39;s a bit of a mess at the moment, wasn&amp;#39;t able to sleep last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Feeling incredibly depressed right now.

These were houses that were $1300/m 3 years ago.  Living in long term care home, that just doesn't sound like something I'd want.  I've thought about it before, but I feel like that setting would just add to my depression.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as being more social, or meeting someone.  It's really that I'm always feeling sick and in too much pain.  I lost all of my friends.  They kept asking me to do things, and I kept insisting I couldn't.  After a while they stopped calling altogether.  I don't blame them, and I'm not bitter about that.  I completely understand it.  It's just not enjoyable for any of us, but it means I'm very alone.  I want friends, but like I said, I don't have the energy or ability to have them.\nI also have a problem with my immune system, so add to that the fact that I'm susceptible to catching every little thing that comes near, and it makes things even more difficult for me to be social, and another reason why a nursing home type place wouldn't be ideal.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as work goes, /u/breathemusic87 is right.  I've tried working, but I'm not at all reliable at any time of the day, and just can't concentrate or be available.  Even when it comes to menial and non-physical tasks.  \n\n\n\n\n\nu/druminfected/  Thanks, I do want to get back into creating music.  I'm trying to figure out ways I can do that without too much physical activity.  I was a guitar player.  I've been thinking about applying to a songwriting program, and I'm trying to find ways to mount a guitar on a stand in playing position.  Not finding anything, but I don't know, maybe something could be built if I design it.  I'll look into online therapy.  Might be better that way if it isn't part of my medical record.  \n\n\n\n\nSorry if I missed anything, my mind's a bit of a mess at the moment, wasn't able to sleep last night.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Rant", "id": "6h2ytr", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I feel like there isn't much more of this life I can take", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 9, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1497567458.0, "link_flair_css_class": "red", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6h2ytr", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6h2ytr/i_feel_like_there_isnt_much_more_of_this_life_i/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1497417654.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6h2ytr/i_feel_like_there_isnt_much_more_of_this_life_i/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "imisstoast", "created_utc": 1497388854.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 24}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I met this girl online.

As you likely know, adapting is changing in order to deal with new situations.  Adapting is something all of us have to do in life, whether it is due to illness, injury, loss, trauma, or whatever one may encounter.  For this podcast, I focus on interviewing adaptive athletes, paralympians, trauma survivors, disability advocates, recovering addicts, cancer survivors, subject matter experts, amputees, folks with terminal illnesses, and various individuals from all walks of life that have adapted to various phenomenon in their lives.  All of these individuals are adapting to what some may deem significantly difficult situations.  We hope these stories will help others learn of ways to adapt to difficulties in their own lives.

Anyone have experience with this?\n\nIf not, does anyone have any suggestions on what devices might offer her all or most of the things she wants in a phone?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6gnsy6", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "We need free or reduced cost landline options", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6gnsy6", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6gnsy6/we_need_free_or_reduced_cost_landline_options/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1497243629.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6gnsy6/we_need_free_or_reduced_cost_landline_options/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Lafojwolf", "created_utc": 1497214829.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any input would be amazing!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Any input would be amazing!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6gkzu7", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "[Question] Issues facing workers in the Aged Care of Disability Sectors?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6gkzu7", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6gkzu7/question_issues_facing_workers_in_the_aged_care/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1497210652.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6gkzu7/question_issues_facing_workers_in_the_aged_care/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "blackmagicremixed", "created_utc": 1497181852.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wondering if anyone has experience with Ontario Student Loans (OSAP) and ODSP (disability).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OSAP is calling constantly, sending me letters, and generally hounding me.

I called up the fire department the first time (after trying to find an accessible taxi service I could ask for help) because I couldn't think of anyone else, and they called the cops, who got a truck and lifted it. The second time, I called the cops again and they did the same thing but I was reprimanded and told they wouldn't help a third time and I should use uber.

I am almost blind if I am without sunglasses at day. This causes majority of problems. Situation is pretty bad even with sunglasses. I can&amp;#39;t play sports, drive a car, work in bright places, hold an eye contact in bright places(almost everywhere in city). Well, I can&amp;#39;t get a job because of this as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the last but not the least problem is my bad eyesight. It&amp;#39;s actually horrible, but I adapted to it. If I am reading a simple document I have to look at it from distance that is as long as my finger, probably around 5-10 cm, basically I have to put it close to my face. So, because of that I also can&amp;#39;t get a lot of jobs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried getting a job in simple areas where you had to lift things etc. And I had no luck. I tried contacting a person who finds jobs for disabled people, but she was rude, she was using (appeal of fear) or something like that on me to force me into sending her my contact information and letting her to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; me. This only made situation worse because she told me that I won&amp;#39;t find a job without her etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only small jobs I managed to find is freelancing video editing for people online. But that&amp;#39;s only few times per few months so it&amp;#39;s almost nothing. I have been editing videos as a hobby for 8+- years and creating small things so i can do it pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I am at a crossroad. All my life I was in public schools and not schools for disabled. My parents tried their best to prepare me to be mature and be able to live on my own, have my life even with my problems. And I adapted pretty good at that. I have no problems living on my own now. Problem is, I want to contribute to society, I want to get a job, be something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it seems that I can&amp;#39;t. I already changed one college curse because they needed good eyes( it was multimedia technology). Now I am studying sales managerment. Problem is, I don&amp;#39;t think that I will be able to find a job even in sales managemment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of non fiction books, I am still trying to find some answers or direction. I always was creative, I created a small video game (hobby), few songs(hobby), but in the end of the day, the value of things things I created besides video editing is 0. So even that feels pointless even thought I thought that I may make it into a carrier or something along these lines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not easy for me in college since I can&amp;#39;t see what is written on whiteboard. And majority of lectures I have are different math, algebra classes.

I am almost blind if I am without sunglasses at day. This causes majority of problems. Situation is pretty bad even with sunglasses. I can't play sports, drive a car, work in bright places, hold an eye contact in bright places(almost everywhere in city). Well, I can't get a job because of this as well. \n\nAnd the last but not the least problem is my bad eyesight. It's actually horrible, but I adapted to it. If I am reading a simple document I have to look at it from distance that is as long as my finger, probably around 5-10 cm, basically I have to put it close to my face. So, because of that I also can't get a lot of jobs. \n\nI tried getting a job in simple areas where you had to lift things etc. And I had no luck. I tried contacting a person who finds jobs for disabled people, but she was rude, she was using (appeal of fear) or something like that on me to force me into sending her my contact information and letting her to \"help\" me. This only made situation worse because she told me that I won't find a job without her etc. \n\nThe only small jobs I managed to find is freelancing video editing for people online. But that's only few times per few months so it's almost nothing. I have been editing videos as a hobby for 8+- years and creating small things so i can do it pretty good. \n\nSo I am at a crossroad. All my life I was in public schools and not schools for disabled. My parents tried their best to prepare me to be mature and be able to live on my own, have my life even with my problems. And I adapted pretty good at that. I have no problems living on my own now. Problem is, I want to contribute to society, I want to get a job, be something. \n\nAnd it seems that I can't. I already changed one college curse because they needed good eyes( it was multimedia technology). Now I am studying sales managerment. Problem is, I don't think that I will be able to find a job even in sales managemment. \n\n I read a lot of non fiction books, I am still trying to find some answers or direction. I always was creative, I created a small video game (hobby), few songs(hobby), but in the end of the day, the value of things things I created besides video editing is 0. So even that feels pointless even thought I thought that I may make it into a carrier or something along these lines. \n\nIt's not easy for me in college since I can't see what is written on whiteboard. And majority of lectures I have are different math, algebra classes.  So I have to study at home more and even those lectures become pointless. \n\nOther bad thing is that because of my eyes , it's hard to find new friends not even talking about girlfriend. I used to try by going to dates, I could make them laugh, generally we both would have a good time(as far as I know, i might be wrong) and after the date I would get an message telling me that... well, you know how it goes. I have friends from my childhood who are happy to spend time with me, so It's not completely bad.\n\nTo me, my life feels like a game of poker, I have a really bad hand,but I try to hold on, try my best and wait for cards on the table, maybe there is a chance to win this life. No matter how small it is.  \n\nIf someone is still reading this. You might think: \"Other people have bigger problems, stop feeling sorry for yourself\". You are right, other people have bigger problems, but that doesn't detract the burden of my problems from me. \n\nSo, I think it's fair to say that my question is only relevant to people who read my entire post. \n\nAnd the question is simple.

Now I get a letter from them that basically states I am not happy with being approved so new hearing ? NOW let me get this straight....HAD a bulls-eye rash but was misdiagnosed. Went to doctor after doctor after doctor after doctor. Diagnosed with Lyme disease almost one year after infection. Experienced heart problems, gray skin, extreme head pressure, cognitive problems, memory problems, nerve and muscle pain, etc. I have lost my taste and smell, and by the way.....LYME DOCTORS AND LONG TERM TREATMENT PROGRAMS ARE OUT OF POCKET. So I am already drained physically, mentally, financially, etc. Stuck with Lyme....2 weeks without antibiotics years later and I cannot function. Relapses occur with stress and illness. I fought for disability several years. My advocate mysteriously retires before 2nd or 3rd hearing in front of the ALJ 2015 and I inherit a new advocate.

I don't like telling people about my conditions, especially people I don't know very well, so I didn't go into specifics.  \n\nI proceeded to get guilt tripped about it.  \"Well the bride wanted everyone to be together, and it's more expensive for everyone if someone doesn't go.\"  I could have eaten my heart after reading that.  I was already depressed about being sick, and that text made me feel 10x worse.  Not only am I a disabled, young person, but now I am also a lame party-pooper.  I offered to help pay for the bride, which seemed to make everyone happy again.\n\nI know this is trivial.  I know I should not care what anyone else thinks.  But I can't help it.

We are planning to use a halo and a pack n' play to room in with him for the first year, so the first floor nursery will have a pullout bed for us and the upstairs nursery will just be a place to  go to nurse/soothe him when he's crying and one of us needs sleep (and will eventually become his room when he is older- our \"master bedroom\" is on the top floor). \n\nWe are doing cloth diapers and I got wet bags for each floor because I can haul a wet bag up/down stairs, but not a laundry basket. \n\nWe have a banister on each side of the stairs but I usually just use my crutches as usual because our old plaster walls are only so strong..\n\nI got a diaper bag that can be worn as a backpack, over the shoulder, or over the back of a wheelchair. \n\nI have a new, lightweight wheelchair en route and the crutches I use are top of the line forearm crutches so I can generally carry things in my fingers and still use them. \n\nCurrently we have stairs at every access point of the house. It's a 1926 craftsman and we just got it in August and are mid restoration, so we haven't implemented a ramp yet. I use my crutches up and down the stairs and drag the chair up/down as needed. We would like to build an attractive ramp that works well with the aesthetic of the home but I can borrow a temp ramp from one of my bffs if I need something in the interim/when baby is first born. I'm 32 weeks &amp; 5 days with a high risk of preterm labor, so I don't have much time left to get my act together! \n\nWhat other solutions have parents with mobility impairments come up with? And if anyone wants to share non-mobility related adaptations they have made, feel free because I'm sure there are new parents out there looking for more info, even if it doesn't necessarily apply in my case :) \n\nThank you in advance! \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6dvgdp", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I am looking for input re:modifying and planning for a baby and parenting beyond.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhe8", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6dvgdp", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/disability/comments/6dvgdp/i_am_looking_for_input_remodifying_and_planning/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1496026405.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/6dvgdp/i_am_looking_for_input_remodifying_and_planning/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ponyfarmer", "created_utc": 1495997605.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/disability", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.disability", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "disability", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on SSDI and have never heard of getting reviewed until I saw some people apparantly are on here.

This went on for years at around 20 years of age I asked her where my card was again, she told me it was lost. I asked her could we get a new one. I kept asking and asking for days and days until finally one day she reached in her purse and threw it at me. She said she used the money and would pay me back a bit each month. I said that was fine. A week or so later she denied she ever took the money and threw me out of the house so I went to live with my dad. She still denies it to this day and says she needed it to pay for my care. If I bring it up she tells me to get out of her house. Please help is she in the wrong? is there anything I can do?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "new", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Question", "id": "6dmm17", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I need advice.
