I\u2019m just a messed up girl who keeps making mistakes. I want to end it because even though he gets upset, I make mistakes everywhere else. Even when I try to be a good girl he just can\u2019t see the good in where I tried, he just sees where I made the mistake. And I don\u2019t blame him, I would do that too if I wasted my time on someone who kept making mistakes. It\u2019s not that I just can\u2019t make him happy, I can\u2019t make anyone else happy either. I live in the shadow of successful people and all I\u2019ve done is never amounted to the expectations made of me. I\u2019d be doing everyone a service by ending it and letting everyone relax and enjoy their lives without me. I want to kill myself because there\u2019s no solution to the mistakes I make. I try so hard not to for him, and it still happens. What can I do if I can\u2019t change? Do I just live in the misery of him being upset with me and projecting that on me? Or do I live with the self loathing and guilt that someone so amazing is giving me a chance? Either way I can\u2019t look at myself in the mirror without thinking that the girl in the reflection deserves to not have the good life she had. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard part is for the next year of my life, I will see him every single day. There\u2019s no getting around that even if I tried. The even harder part is that if I DO choose to remove him from my life, the only way that\u2019s possible is by committing career suicide. It\u2019s not an exaggeration, but I would be giving up the only worthwhile thing in my life right now. There\u2019s no alternatives, if I do that I can\u2019t just \u201cget another job.\u201d It really really doesn\u2019t work like that at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I\u2019m just looking for a sign not to do it. I\u2019ve rationally tried to wrap my head around it for some months and this seems to be the only solution to stopping the problems of the love of my life. I need a reason not to but I\u2019m starting to see that few of those exist. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I know the first thing people will want to comment is that I shouldn\u2019t kill myself over a guy. \u201cYou\u2019ll find someone else, relationships aren\u2019t worth your life.\u201d That\u2019s not the reason I want to do it.

So please, if anyone is reading and wants to help, please don\u2019t advise me not to do it over some guy. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. \n\nThe reason I want to do it because I keep fucking up. He\u2019s amazing to me and gets upset but rightfully so. I\u2019m just a messed up girl who keeps making mistakes. I want to end it because even though he gets upset, I make mistakes everywhere else. Even when I try to be a good girl he just can\u2019t see the good in where I tried, he just sees where I made the mistake. And I don\u2019t blame him, I would do that too if I wasted my time on someone who kept making mistakes. It\u2019s not that I just can\u2019t make him happy, I can\u2019t make anyone else happy either. I live in the shadow of successful people and all I\u2019ve done is never amounted to the expectations made of me. I\u2019d be doing everyone a service by ending it and letting everyone relax and enjoy their lives without me. I want to kill myself because there\u2019s no solution to the mistakes I make. I try so hard not to for him, and it still happens. What can I do if I can\u2019t change? Do I just live in the misery of him being upset with me and projecting that on me? Or do I live with the self loathing and guilt that someone so amazing is giving me a chance? Either way I can\u2019t look at myself in the mirror without thinking that the girl in the reflection deserves to not have the good life she had. \n\nThe hard part is for the next year of my life, I will see him every single day. There\u2019s no getting around that even if I tried. The even harder part is that if I DO choose to remove him from my life, the only way that\u2019s possible is by committing career suicide. It\u2019s not an exaggeration, but I would be giving up the only worthwhile thing in my life right now. There\u2019s no alternatives, if I do that I can\u2019t just \u201cget another job.\u201d It really really doesn\u2019t work like that at all. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m just looking for a sign not to do it. I\u2019ve rationally tried to wrap my head around it for some months and this seems to be the only solution to stopping the problems of the love of my life. I need a reason not to but I\u2019m starting to see that few of those exist.

God gave me that oppertunity but I threw it away because of greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all started six years ago, just about a year after I had finnished high school. I had a hard time finding a job which was normal for a  newly graduated high school kid without connections, my family also had a summer house that we always went to during the summer so I never really had the oppertunity to get any job experience prior to this that would certainly have helped my resume. All my close friends started their lifes, most of them got decent jobs through their parents etc. It got me really isolated just sitting at home doing pretty much nothing and it got me really stressed out knowing I was the only one of my friends not doing any progress in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while I started to get depressed and the pressure from both family and friends to find something to do just kept building up as I had no clue whatsoever about what I wanted to do with my life. Things got pretty bad but then one night everything changed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I used to spend all my free-time playing &amp;quot;competetive&amp;quot; video games, world of warcraft arenas, counter-strike and league of legends to name a few. I was good too. One day as I was browsing the internet, I stumbled upon something interesting. I had just started doing some sports betting, mostly for fun to make matches more interesting. Besides playing video games, two other big hobbys of mine are soccer and basketball, hence why I got into sports betting. Anyways, one day when I was browsing the site where I used to place my bets, I noticed that they had introduced Esports and I saw a lot of counter-strike matches popping up in the live section which of course got me interested... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started observing the odds and how they moved from round to round, it was safe to say that the bookie who was in charge had no clue what he was doing. After one weekened, I turned $10 into $30 000 and then I got limited (banned from the site for wining). This was surreal to me, I had never had more than $300 in my bank account before. All the anxiety I had felt disapeard in an instant and when I on christmas eve told my family about it, god damn, it was the best feeling I ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the question was, what do I do with the money? Do I just save it and maybe use it as a downpayment for an apartment or do I pursue my &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot; of having a life where I&amp;#39;m my own boss. I started reading about the stock market, like I did some serious research, pretty much 14 hrs a day for 2 months just reading about stocks etc. Once I finally decided to enter the market I started off well. Profited about $5 000 on my first buy/sell. But I then learned something, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much you read, in the end its experiences that matters. In the upcoming 6 months I lost 90% of the $35 000 and I started to experience a depression like no other but as I didn&amp;#39;t wanna tell my family about it, I still had to live every day like I was fine and oh man was it draining. Whenever my parents were working I just lay in bed all day and couldn&amp;#39;t move. When they were home I got up and pretented to be normal. I wasn&amp;#39;t suicidal at the time, just kind of paralyzed by the lack of motivation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple months I noticed that another big counter-strike tournament was about to start, at this time Esport was still very small and it was maybe a big tournament with broadcasted matches every 4-6 months, today it&amp;#39;s pretty much different leagues going on every day and big tournaments every other week. Anyways, I decided to make a new gambling account in my moms name so I could try my luck again. This time I started with $200 and made close to $50 000 in a weeks time. I got limited every day but kept making new accounts in my dads and siblings names so I managed to last the entire tournament. And again, just like last time, all the anxiety disapeard and this is where I started to kind of believe that god actually exists and that he may had heard my prayers as I got another chance to pursure my dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the 6 months where I lost all the money that I had previously won, I learned a lot and found a strategy that was pretty much bullet proof. I once again entered the stock market and found immediate success. I made about $30k my first year as a fulltime &amp;quot;trader&amp;quot; and as I still lived at home without any expenses this was all money that kept going into my bankroll. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a couple years I had a net worth of about $350 000 and that&amp;#39;s where greed took over. It was about a year ago now, all my friends had moved out from their parents home and seriously started their lifes, I might have been the richest one moneywise but I had nothing else and I still lived at home with my parents. I really wanted to move out and also start a life of my own, I knew I could keep making good money and maybe eventually start a business. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, why didn&amp;#39;t I? Problem was that in the banks eyes I was still worth nothing as I had no income tax in my register which means I couldn&amp;#39;t take a loan so I would have to pay it all at ones and the apartments I was looking at were about $250 000 which would hurt my bankroll a lot and I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable having a place of my own, paying for everything etc with a $100 000 bankroll as it&amp;#39;s not much of a safety net if things went bad. I got greedy and decided that I really wanted to get a place within the next 3 months and to do so I needed to take bigger risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought shares in some mining company and waited 2 months but the news I was waiting for just kept getin delayed so I decided to sell and invest in a medical company who was about to recieve big news. About a week after I had made a big investment the news finally came, unfortnately they were bad, like real bad. The CEO of the company had been lying to everyone and the stock dropped 90% in an instant. Meanwhile, the mining company I had invested in, went from $0.03 -  $0.2. I got extremely tilted and just kept making dumb decision after dumb decision. After a few months I only had about $60 000 left. I withrew it from my bank and put it into the gambling site and I saw nothing but black. I could bet $2.500 on some soccer game where I had never heard of any of the two teams and I just kept doing it till I was at 0.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and while you&amp;#39;re reading this you might be like, so what, you&amp;#39;re still in your early 20&amp;#39;s, having no money is no reason to kill your self. I left out that during my trading time, I used to lend money from my mom to do normal stuff and I always paid her back etc it was nothing special but right before my greediness took over I took a considerable loan from her to fund an investment outside of the stockmarket, it was about $40 000. I didn&amp;#39;t even have this in mind when I threw away my last $60 000, that&amp;#39;s how deep down I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knew about any of this. I now started to ask friends and family for loans to try and make at least $40 000 so I could pay my mom back. Unfortunately I just kept losing, sometimes I would win a lot but once I was very close to making it I lost it all, every time. The loans from family and friends just kept piling up and now my total debt was: mom: $40k, sister $6k, friend1 $9k, friend2 $5k and friend3 $2k, total of: $62k. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point it was bad, like suicidal thoughts bad and this is gonna sound real crazy but its 100% true. I went to a bridge near my home and had a serious break down in the middle of the night, I started screaming at god (cus desperate? lol idk). I went up the railing and ready to jump but I actually fell off because of the wind and suddenly the urge I had felt to kill my self was compeltely gone. I kinda just landed and felt nothing for a couple minutes, then went home, took my last $20 and somehow a few hrs later turned it into $3k, $3k then turned into $10k a day later and $35k a couple days later after that. I had no explanation as to what happened, keep in mind that these bets were not on something I had an edge on, it was on random games where I baerly knew the teams - pure luck. I thought to my self, well, it&amp;#39;s time to stop, I might not be able to cover the whole debt but I can pay back my friends and sister and some of my mom and then find a job and pay her back within a year. I started making a deposit and after 24 hrs I got a message saying I needed to provide some bank statements to prove that I&amp;#39;m playing on my own account. Unfortunately as I have already told you, I was limited on my own account so I made new ones in friends and families. Usually I would deposit money into the account from the person who&amp;#39;s personal information I had used, but not this time, I made the deposit with my own bank account and I think they already knew that when they asked for the information. Basically, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to withdraw the money. Up untill this point I had seriously thought it was gods doing, from the falling off the bridge to suddenly turning $20 into $35k in a few days with pure luck, but then this happened and it instead felt like he was toying with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The suicidal thoughts came back but decided to tell my mom about everything. I finally came clean and it felt insanely good, she then decided to pay off my debts to my sister and friends and take the entire debt on her self. She then sent me about $20k to pay off all my friends but what do you think I did with the money? I sure as hell didn&amp;#39;t pay off any debts. I started gambling again, I can&amp;#39;t even explain why. I came clean for god sake, I got a 2nd chance but once again gambled it away and not only that, to try and recover, I took even more loans from friends. Now my total debt is something like this: Mom $62k, sister $4k, friend1 $14k, friend2 $9k, friend3 $5k, friend4 $2k, friend5 $1k total of: $97k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way out now, my mom was destroyed already after the first time I had told her and just telling her I came clean only to abuse her (ofc it wasnt my intention but it happened regardless) even more will end her and the shame I feel towards her and my friends is already killing me inside, there&amp;#39;s no way out of this now. Not only did I fuck my own life up, I fucked my moms life up by basically stealing $60k from her not to mention my two friends that I owe $14k and $9k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love my family and friends like no other, I would on any given day take a bullet for them so guys, stay away from gambling. Even if you win, it might come a day where you get depressed or something and trust me, you do not wanna be associated with gambling in any way when you&amp;#39;re not at 100 % mentally, it might end you like it did with me and many others before me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I regret a lof of things, wondering what will happen to my mom and not beeing able to watch my two year old nephew grow up is the hardest part but the shame is simply to much. Good luck everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I never knew what to be when I grew up, everyone had their dreams to become lawyers, police officers, doctors etc, not me, all I ever wanted was to have something of my own, work for my self and be able to live my life on my terms. God gave me that oppertunity but I threw it away because of greed.\n\nIt all started six years ago, just about a year after I had finnished high school. I had a hard time finding a job which was normal for a  newly graduated high school kid without connections, my family also had a summer house that we always went to during the summer so I never really had the oppertunity to get any job experience prior to this that would certainly have helped my resume. All my close friends started their lifes, most of them got decent jobs through their parents etc. It got me really isolated just sitting at home doing pretty much nothing and it got me really stressed out knowing I was the only one of my friends not doing any progress in life.\n\nAfter a while I started to get depressed and the pressure from both family and friends to find something to do just kept building up as I had no clue whatsoever about what I wanted to do with my life. Things got pretty bad but then one night everything changed. \n\nGrowing up, I used to spend all my free-time playing \"competetive\" video games, world of warcraft arenas, counter-strike and league of legends to name a few. I was good too. One day as I was browsing the internet, I stumbled upon something interesting. I had just started doing some sports betting, mostly for fun to make matches more interesting. Besides playing video games, two other big hobbys of mine are soccer and basketball, hence why I got into sports betting. Anyways, one day when I was browsing the site where I used to place my bets, I noticed that they had introduced Esports and I saw a lot of counter-strike matches popping up in the live section which of course got me interested... \n\nI started observing the odds and how they moved from round to round, it was safe to say that the bookie who was in charge had no clue what he was doing.

I just want to stop feeling the way I do. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. This feels like one of the lowest points in my life, I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s the lowest. But I&amp;#39;ve felt like this so often that I&amp;#39;m not strong enough to deal with it in anymore. I cry all the time; I&amp;#39;m either numb or sad. I used to be a class clown, now I have almost no friends and I can&amp;#39;t make any. The friends I did have abandoned me for mostly ridiculous reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got in a fight with one of them and the other 10+ stopped talking to me for good. It was a dumb fight and I even called one of them on the phone instead of just texting or IMing. I told them they hurt me. That was 6 months ago. I rely heavily on my online friends, but even they&amp;#39;re tired of me. Everyone always leaves in the end. Every intimate relationship I&amp;#39;ve ever had has ended in flames. I have abandonment issues and I&amp;#39;m now filled with so much self hatred that the only thing keeping me from ending it all is my pure fear of pain and dying and the fact that my parents will miss me, and have to deal with everyone saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry&amp;quot; and the funeral costs, plus whatever else. I&amp;#39;m in college, I don&amp;#39;t have much to leave them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know my parents care but they can&amp;#39;t help. They don&amp;#39;t know how to take me seriously, and they&amp;#39;re divorced. They&amp;#39;re like adult babies that I have to keep an eye on, and they are no help when giving advice. My mom has been emotionally abusive in the past but I love her and she does help, but it isn&amp;#39;t enough. My dad loves me so much but only if I continue to be his perfect, genius little girl. Being away at college is hard enough, especially when I feel so isolated and have very few friends, and I&amp;#39;m terrified of having an angry outburst and scaring away the few I have left. I&amp;#39;m president of a club and no one wants me to be the president because I can no longer control my emotions when I have a bad day, and every day is a bad day. My vice-president was once my friend, but I&amp;#39;ve known he disliked me for whatever reason for a long time. He finally let me have it though. I&amp;#39;m used to people abandoning me, or not liking me when I let myself just be me around them. I&amp;#39;m not stupid. Well, yes, I am. I&amp;#39;m so stupid and bad at school that I&amp;#39;ve come to this subreddit. But I know the signs of someone getting tired of me by heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But recently it all came to a head and I was having a horrible day, thinking about how I hate my second major and having to do work I don&amp;#39;t understand and never will for it. I know I&amp;#39;ll never get a job if I don&amp;#39;t do it, though. I feel like I have no future, for a lot of reasons. That&amp;#39;s just one of them. You can inference the rest. cough politics cough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the people that do like me and have a lot of patience or at least want me around say I&amp;#39;m dramatic and that they can&amp;#39;t be around me anymore. I wish they didn&amp;#39;t make me feel bad for just having emotions, but I don&amp;#39;t know what to think anymore. So many people have told me this for so long that I truly believe I am an irrational, terrible person now. I don&amp;#39;t deserve to live, and yet I&amp;#39;m furious at my terrible luck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate how I look, I hate my body. No one will ever love me maybe because of my personality or how loud and ugly I am. I know the friends I have now will be gone in the future, so what is the point of continuing to live? They won&amp;#39;t hurt that badly. I am forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no skills to speak of as I can do many things but I&amp;#39;m not good at anything. Not even great, just good. The workforce is not forgiving to people like me. And when people just tell me that it will get harder after school, I know they&amp;#39;re right. Still bad &amp;quot;advice&amp;quot; to give, to anyone really. Especially me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more I do something I have to but I hate, the harder it is for me to do it. My summer was horrible, with all of my friends abandoning me carelessly and having to work two separate awful medium wage jobs. My few remaining friends are so tired of hearing it. But I can&amp;#39;t keep anything inside anymore. I spill everything out with tears or anger and then I&amp;#39;m just empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one believes me when I say I&amp;#39;m hurting, and if they do, they don&amp;#39;t understand the scope of it. When I hurt, I feel the pain throughout my body. I feel so fucking hopeless that I could actually die of sadness right then and there. And I wish I could. I wish I could just fucking die from how sad I am. It feels like I&amp;#39;m getting stabbed, choked, and am about to vomit all at the same time. I just wish the feeling had the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to die because I want the people who hurt me to truly understand what they did. I want them to live with that for the rest of their lives, or until they are driven to the sadness they drove me to and do the same. I want someone at my funeral telling specific people to get out because I don&amp;#39;t want them there. I want them to know that it wasn&amp;#39;t suicide, it was them who pushed me off the edge. It was murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired, I&amp;#39;m sorry. This goes from sad to angry to sad to angry. I just can&amp;#39;t do this anymore. I can&amp;#39;t deal with how much of a fucking failure I am. I can&amp;#39;t deal with how much those around me have failed me, and how much I&amp;#39;ve convinced myself I failed them. I sleep all the time now. I no longer want to be awake. The things that are usually enough to distract me are not enough, and my computer is getting fixed right now so I only have my phone and my thoughts. My last remaining friends are clearly worried but it&amp;#39;s time for finals and no one even has the time or energy to sit down with me and ask me what&amp;#39;s wrong, and frankly I don&amp;#39;t either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to fail my class and have to drop out of my major. I&amp;#39;m going to have to disappoint my parents. And worst of all, I&amp;#39;m going to have to keep living like this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I were dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Well, it's not really that I want to die. I just want to stop feeling the way I do. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. This feels like one of the lowest points in my life, I'm not sure if it's the lowest. But I've felt like this so often that I'm not strong enough to deal with it in anymore. I cry all the time; I'm either numb or sad. I used to be a class clown, now I have almost no friends and I can't make any. The friends I did have abandoned me for mostly ridiculous reasons.\n\nI got in a fight with one of them and the other 10+ stopped talking to me for good. It was a dumb fight and I even called one of them on the phone instead of just texting or IMing. I told them they hurt me. That was 6 months ago. I rely heavily on my online friends, but even they're tired of me. Everyone always leaves in the end. Every intimate relationship I've ever had has ended in flames. I have abandonment issues and I'm now filled with so much self hatred that the only thing keeping me from ending it all is my pure fear of pain and dying and the fact that my parents will miss me, and have to deal with everyone saying \"I'm sorry\" and the funeral costs, plus whatever else. I'm in college, I don't have much to leave them.\n\nI know my parents care but they can't help. They don't know how to take me seriously, and they're divorced. They're like adult babies that I have to keep an eye on, and they are no help when giving advice. My mom has been emotionally abusive in the past but I love her and she does help, but it isn't enough. My dad loves me so much but only if I continue to be his perfect, genius little girl. Being away at college is hard enough, especially when I feel so isolated and have very few friends, and I'm terrified of having an angry outburst and scaring away the few I have left. I'm president of a club and no one wants me to be the president because I can no longer control my emotions when I have a bad day, and every day is a bad day. My vice-president was once my friend, but I've known he disliked me for whatever reason for a long time. He finally let me have it though.

I\u2019ve been getting rejected a lot by women these past 3 years. At first it wasn\u2019t easy letting go of someone who didn\u2019t like you back, but now with the experience I have gotten over the years, it\u2019s quite easy to move on to a different girl. I\u2019ve definitely missed some opportunities with women liking me and me not realizing it. But now I\u2019ll take any opportunity i can get as long as I\u2019m attracted to them. Ive come along way being that shy, not confident kid who didn\u2019t know how to talk to girls.

I don\u2019t understand what I did to deserve that and I\u2019m not gonna lie it made me feel like complete shit. To make things worse, i went to a party this past weekend, got introduced to a cute girl. We talked for a bit. Asked to get coffee with her and got her number. The next morning i texted her \u201cHey, it was nice meeting you\u201d. She left me on read. That was Monday. I\u2019m talking to another girl now but she hasn\u2019t replied in hour to my \u201cHey, how have you been?\u201d text. I\u2019m already expecting that she won\u2019t reply at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know why I feel like I need a woman to feel happy about myself but I certainly feel alone. It\u2019s not even the sex that I want. I just want someone to cuddle with in bed, talk to, and make laugh. The way Hollywood makes it seems so easy and achievable. But it\u2019s not. Every romantic scene that I see in TV just makes me feel shitty about myself and makes me think \u201cwhy can\u2019t that be me?\u201d. I\u2019ve tried tinder ever since it came out. I\u2019ve maybe had a handful of successful dates? Maybe 3 or 4 first dates that went onto a second date? There was this one specific women that I connected with and I think she felt the same way. Too bad she moved across country, probably most likely won\u2019t ever see her again. I felt the most compatible with her. But that\u2019s just my luck I guess. I haven\u2019t had anything that felt like that since and that was in August. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I should feel more appreciative because I know there\u2019s a thousand guys out there that wish they could be in my position. But sometimes I wish i was in their position because honestly it doesn\u2019t feel any better maybe even worse. I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m attractive, I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m handsome. But I don\u2019t see it yet. I\u2019m social, funny, approachable...i don\u2019t get what I\u2019m doing wrong. I go out, I\u2019m trying to go out to more bars or just wherever to meet women. I have had so many failures in the dating game that i just feel hideous. I do have a crooked nose and i feel like that\u2019s a big issue. I\u2019ve gotten plastic surgery to fix it because people were making fun of me for in back in high school but it\u2019s still slightly fucked up. Who knows, maybe it\u2019s not as a big deal as I\u2019m bringing it out to be. Maybe my standards are too high but I\u2019ve always been told to never sell yourself short and always go for the best. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna change. I may have fucked up early with being clingy as fuck to some women but I have learned from my mistakes. I\u2019m always learning new things about the dating game but nothing seems to change. Same results though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year I have definitely gone out with more women than in previous years thanks to online apps. But nothing happens after the first date. I think I\u2019m close to giving up. I dropped out of a huge university back in 2015 because I said some suicidal shit, mainly about my women problems. I\u2019ve been at community college ever since and am transferring to my cities university in the spring that\u2019s about the same size as my old university. The girl to guy ratio is like 60:40 but I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find anyone. People see me as this confident, funny guy on the outside , but they don\u2019t know how empty I feel on the inside. Talking to people won\u2019t help as i already feel like my depression has consumed me and now I\u2019m just waiting for the right time to kill myself. I\u2019ve been exercising and focusing on school to see if it help me overcome this phase that I\u2019m going through but I just find myself back to square one. I always expect the worst when a girl takes forever to reply back. I always think maybe I should have said something different. I always think that it\u2019s something that I did wrong. I always over analyze things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like i said earlier, I\u2019m talking to someone right now actually but she hasn\u2019t responded in a couple of hours so I\u2019m already thinking that she\u2019s done with me and that I did something wrong. Same shit different day. I feel as if none of my friends care about me either. Whenever i to hang out with someone, ask for advice, or just want to talk i get left on read. I feel like i have no one. I thought maybe a change of scenery would help me but I\u2019m starting to think that it\u2019s gonna make it worse. My goal is to move to Pittsburgh once I get my degree here in NC. Working for the major league team over there, the Pirates would be my dream job as I\u2019m a huge baseball fan. But now, Im starting to think that it might not happen. I still live with my parents. I did terrible this semester in school, only got one A, I\u2019m pretty sure i failed or got a D in my other two classes. Will probably be put on academic probation going into next semester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know what keeps me going. I just wish a loaded gun would drop right infront of me so I can just end it. I\u2019ve looked online for guns and they\u2019re expensive, looks like I\u2019ll have to save up but I\u2019m pretty bad at that too. I\u2019ve started to look at the suicide success rate for guns and I\u2019m guessing if I find the right gun, it\u2019s doable. Either it\u2019s that or I\u2019ll just drive myself to my death but I know I\u2019ll never have the courage to do that. Probably no one is gonna read all of this. Probably nobody cares but I feel like nothings gonna change. I\u2019m starting to get that feeling about not giving a shit about anymore. I guess next semester will determine what i will do with my life. Hopefully I get rejected a bunch of times so i can get closer to killing myself. I know I\u2019m gonna try next and hopefully there\u2019s gonna be a rejection that I will experience that will push me off the edge. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been saying that I want to kill myself since senior year in high school.

It doesn&amp;#39;t sound that bad on its own probably but in the context of my life right now I really, really needed this to actually be good. I&amp;#39;m a junior in college and its just been a whole semester of mediocrity for me, and I have been trying harder than I was last year. The rest of my grades for my other classes aren&amp;#39;t that much better, and I have been really trying hard to improve my GPA for years. I want to go to a good law school but these college grades aren&amp;#39;t up to show for it, and I have spent days on end staring into space and procrastinating on whatever normal work I have to do for the day, all while feeling that it&amp;#39;s just so pointless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My social life isn&amp;#39;t any better either. My only friends are my roommates and they just add to the distraction and frequently piss me off indirectly, usually with them constantly shitting on other people I know behind their backs or just constant complaining about everyone else around them. I don&amp;#39;t use the word often but its such a toxic atmosphere. They haven&amp;#39;t said anything to my face about it but I know I&amp;#39;m also a really sensitive person and I can tear up over the smallest things, so I hide that so I can&amp;#39;t get bothered by anybody over it. I&amp;#39;ve been doing that for years, along with thinking about suicide, but its all so tiresome. So many fantasies, ranging from notes that call out people I want to suffer for making me suffer to just vague apologies to the few people who care about me, and vice versa.

It doesn't sound that bad on its own probably but in the context of my life right now I really, really needed this to actually be good. I'm a junior in college and its just been a whole semester of mediocrity for me, and I have been trying harder than I was last year. The rest of my grades for my other classes aren't that much better, and I have been really trying hard to improve my GPA for years. I want to go to a good law school but these college grades aren't up to show for it, and I have spent days on end staring into space and procrastinating on whatever normal work I have to do for the day, all while feeling that it's just so pointless. \n\nMy social life isn't any better either. My only friends are my roommates and they just add to the distraction and frequently piss me off indirectly, usually with them constantly shitting on other people I know behind their backs or just constant complaining about everyone else around them. I don't use the word often but its such a toxic atmosphere. They haven't said anything to my face about it but I know I'm also a really sensitive person and I can tear up over the smallest things, so I hide that so I can't get bothered by anybody over it. I've been doing that for years, along with thinking about suicide, but its all so tiresome. So many fantasies, ranging from notes that call out people I want to suffer for making me suffer to just vague apologies to the few people who care about me, and vice versa.

For anyone who will listen and read this please let me provide some backstory / background text for the reason of me making this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been feeling a little bit &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; as some would put it. I&amp;#39;ve been working my ass off in school, and I&amp;#39;m trying. I really am. My goal is to get all A&amp;#39;s &amp;amp; B&amp;#39;s, because I want to succeed. I have goals for the future. Or at least I had goals. Today I went from a 84.4 (B) to a 54.2 (F) and It kinda reminded me of something : I feel like a robot, doing the same thing everyday. Wake Up, School, work, etc. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with my past depression too, But at my school, there&amp;#39;s no one to talk to about it. And here&amp;#39;s the worst part : They crack jokes about depressed people....and I laugh. Sometimes I join in. I feel like shit because of that. I already cant talk to anyone because of that. But now I&amp;#39;m putting down the people who are in the same boat as me. I&amp;#39;m fucking disgusting, and I know it. On top of that, my friends hate suicidal people. I cant even tell anyone I know about it. I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with depression for a while. I&amp;#39;ve been hospitalized for it 3 times, and at the time of this, I&amp;#39;m 15, and two of them have happened in the same year. Not good. I&amp;#39;ve tried different meds, like Seroquel, which I have 400MG for. I&amp;#39;ve been contemplating suicide alot. But I feel like I&amp;#39;ve just been becoming a hollow shell of myself. I dont know who I am, or what I&amp;#39;m gonna do. I&amp;#39;ve tried stuff like sports, but it hasn&amp;#39;t worked. I&amp;#39;ve been raped before. 3 times, And I make jokes about that too. I&amp;#39;m an evil cunt. A horrible son of a bitch. I deserve to die. I&amp;#39;ve done drugs before, yet I critisize others for it. I&amp;#39;m a joke. A hypocrite. I&amp;#39;ve self harmed, yet I make jokes about it. What kind of sick fuck am I? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most recently at my last hospitalization (AUGUST, 2017)I met this girl. Cheyanne was her name. Hospitalized for Meth possession and use. Fast foreward and she liked me. I still dont know if i really liked her or if i just led her on, but some part of me knows : I led her on. I fucking suck. She really really liked me and I led her to believe something false. Fuck. I&amp;#39;ve been abused before, but I&amp;#39;ve hit my sisters a couple times. Although it was never too frequent, I know I am a shitbag. I&amp;#39;ve punched, smacked and hit them. Females.

For anyone who will listen and read this please let me provide some backstory / background text for the reason of me making this post.\n\nRecently, I've been feeling a little bit \"down\" as some would put it. I've been working my ass off in school, and I'm trying. I really am. My goal is to get all A's &amp; B's, because I want to succeed. I have goals for the future. Or at least I had goals. Today I went from a 84.4 (B) to a 54.2 (F) and It kinda reminded me of something : I feel like a robot, doing the same thing everyday. Wake Up, School, work, etc. I've been struggling with my past depression too, But at my school, there's no one to talk to about it. And here's the worst part : They crack jokes about depressed people....and I laugh. Sometimes I join in. I feel like shit because of that. I already cant talk to anyone because of that. But now I'm putting down the people who are in the same boat as me. I'm fucking disgusting, and I know it. On top of that, my friends hate suicidal people. I cant even tell anyone I know about it. I've been struggling with depression for a while. I've been hospitalized for it 3 times, and at the time of this, I'm 15, and two of them have happened in the same year. Not good. I've tried different meds, like Seroquel, which I have 400MG for. I've been contemplating suicide alot. But I feel like I've just been becoming a hollow shell of myself. I dont know who I am, or what I'm gonna do. I've tried stuff like sports, but it hasn't worked. I've been raped before. 3 times, And I make jokes about that too. I'm an evil cunt. A horrible son of a bitch. I deserve to die. I've done drugs before, yet I critisize others for it. I'm a joke. A hypocrite. I've self harmed, yet I make jokes about it. What kind of sick fuck am I? \n\nAnd most recently at my last hospitalization (AUGUST, 2017)I met this girl. Cheyanne was her name. Hospitalized for Meth possession and use. Fast foreward and she liked me. I still dont know if i really liked her or if i just led her on, but some part of me knows : I led her on. I fucking suck. She really really liked me and I led her to believe something false. Fuck. I've been abused before, but I've hit my sisters a couple times. Although it was never too frequent, I know I am a shitbag. I've punched, smacked and hit them. Females. I've stolen from my mother and have hidden money from her when everyone else was starving. Why do I deserve to live?\n\nI'm scared of committment and I haven't been in a real relationship since 2015. Fuck. I'm Bipolar and depressed with anxiety disorder. I feel lost. I don't know why I do some of the shit I do. I don't. And I know I need to be punished for it. \n\nMy last real relationship with this girl (Anorexic btw) went sour.

I mean, I&amp;#39;ve never really talked to him about it before, but I know he struggles a lot as well... I&amp;#39;ve never actually met him, but we&amp;#39;ve been friends online for at about three years now and I honestly care more about him than most or all of the people I know in real life. Either way, I don&amp;#39;t want him to worry about me.

I thought about saying goodbyes to people, leaving messages for them and telling them how much I appreciated them, how I was sorry for drifting away from them or seeming indifferent or cold... since I could never really express myself to people before. But I also thought how cruel that was, for someone to learn of how you felt only for you to be gone forever. Again, getting back to just wanting to disappear... haha...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of shitty timing too, holidays and all... man what a terrible thing to do to someone.

First time using reddit and I figured this might be a good place to post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always knew I&amp;#39;d fuck up somewhere in life. I&amp;#39;ve always had an interest in pursuing a medical career but a couple years back before the Marines I knew I did not possess the intelligence nor the competitive drive to succeed in med-school. I considered Warrant Officer Flight Training (helicopter pilot training) and didn&amp;#39;t meet the requirements, it&amp;#39;s also very competitive and the most coveted job in the Army. Hell I even considered 68W (medic), but I figured it would be pointless as I simply cannot put any of that medical expertise to use in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps infantry field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depression came over me when I was about 12 or so. Slowly I began to realise that I&amp;#39;m mortal and not special, just another commoner whose dreams were becoming a slightly better off wage slave with a slightly higher salary who pays slightly more taxes to the government until he dies, gets buried in a shallow grave and forgotten about after 5 years. Slowly began to realise that I don&amp;#39;t have the will nor the tools to make a break for what I want from life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t hate myself for enlisting but rather for existing. Sure life in the Corps is tough and so is lugging a machine gun (I&amp;#39;m an 0331 aka super grunt) but it&amp;#39;s nice for me to have somebody do the thinking for me, tell me what to do and where to go and when to be there and have like-minded people to care and bleed for and drink with to forget all the troubles that ever were or will be. I enlisted however in the hopes that there would be a war and I would be placed on the front line and die with honour but that day never came.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t take it anymore, being alive, existing. I feel like I&amp;#39;m walking underwater at best but when the numbing of drink goes away I know I&amp;#39;m drowning. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy the things I used to anymore. Playing the guitar made me feel alive a few years back and now it doesn&amp;#39;t and I forgot how to play it. Cleaning the weapons and drills and PT and meditation keep the mind from idling but it&amp;#39;s during those moments between wakefulness and sleep that I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t be alive and that I don&amp;#39;t want to.

First time using reddit and I figured this might be a good place to post.\n\nI always knew I'd fuck up somewhere in life. I've always had an interest in pursuing a medical career but a couple years back before the Marines I knew I did not possess the intelligence nor the competitive drive to succeed in med-school. I considered Warrant Officer Flight Training (helicopter pilot training) and didn't meet the requirements, it's also very competitive and the most coveted job in the Army. Hell I even considered 68W (medic), but I figured it would be pointless as I simply cannot put any of that medical expertise to use in the future. \n\nAnd so I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps infantry field.\n\nDepression came over me when I was about 12 or so. Slowly I began to realise that I'm mortal and not special, just another commoner whose dreams were becoming a slightly better off wage slave with a slightly higher salary who pays slightly more taxes to the government until he dies, gets buried in a shallow grave and forgotten about after 5 years. Slowly began to realise that I don't have the will nor the tools to make a break for what I want from life.\n\nI don't hate myself for enlisting but rather for existing. Sure life in the Corps is tough and so is lugging a machine gun (I'm an 0331 aka super grunt) but it's nice for me to have somebody do the thinking for me, tell me what to do and where to go and when to be there and have like-minded people to care and bleed for and drink with to forget all the troubles that ever were or will be. I enlisted however in the hopes that there would be a war and I would be placed on the front line and die with honour but that day never came.\n\nI just can't take it anymore, being alive, existing. I feel like I'm walking underwater at best but when the numbing of drink goes away I know I'm drowning. I don't enjoy the things I used to anymore. Playing the guitar made me feel alive a few years back and now it doesn't and I forgot how to play it. Cleaning the weapons and drills and PT and meditation keep the mind from idling but it's during those moments between wakefulness and sleep that I know I shouldn't be alive and that I don't want to. One too many times I cried myself to sleep after making sure everybody fell asleep but I just feel too numb to shed tears now although the lump in my throat is still there and the feeling of sinking into a void ever omnipresent.\n\nI never consented to being born, and 2 months left until I'm kicked and back on the streets again. I am sure I don't want to live anymore. I was supposed to be alive and go and live a great life and do great things but I died a long long time ago.

I am probably will just not do it but I am posting here to get help not to do so but if you wish to help I ask one thing of you, do not put \"you are only 14\" or \"how can you know what to expect later at the age of 14\" because believe it or not my age does not determine what I can and cannot think, I know a lot of adults who think more like a child than me, in fact most of them do but let's see the measuring until our dicks are out it is time to save a life. that was a reference btw, I am not that self centred. \nmany thanks,\nanother depressed 14 year old.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i0soc", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I can't fucking do it no more", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i0soc", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7i0soc/i_cant_fucking_do_it_no_more/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512620491.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7i0soc/i_cant_fucking_do_it_no_more/", "author_flair_text": "", "quarantine": false, "author": "Alex-Wilkinson72", "created_utc": 1512591691.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never done this before but I want to put this out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have for the last 9 years never went to bed without thinking about killing myself.\nI&amp;#39;ve even gone so far to plan a few attempts I have the means necessary but I have doubts but those doubts are starting to recede and I believe  that one day it will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s go back to where my spiral into depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I had a small group of friends I will be using aliases Sarah, Morgan, and I.\nWe were friends since we could well remember anything really always together absolutely inseparable I remember playing in the woods making forts, pretend sword fighting, watching clouds, even reading books together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was bullied a lot in school always made fun of for my looks, weight and my stutter, also especially harsh from the other boys because my two best friends were girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morgan once punched a kid&amp;#39;s tooth out for pushing my head into my tray of food she was always the tough one.\nSarah though was always in the books and loved sci fi and mystery.

I was happy about that because we were counting pennies after dad died and the new guy was working in a bank. He got mom pregnant and the bank kicked him out for some reason. Great, nobody has a job and there\u2019s soon to be 5 mouths to feed including the dog...  he was working hard and started paying the bills, we could eat again and it was all looking better until problems in middle school started. I was getting bullied, made fun of for being fat and nobody trusted me at this point. (Understandably)This is where i started cutting myself for the first time. Time kind of went by with me barely passing the classes. Then high school came and it was there where i realized how little i\u2019ve known... the friends i had in MS went with me to HS so it was not looking pretty.

We had simmilar interests and we liked each other. It was my first Real girlfriend. We were together for 6 months but she broke up with me a couple of weeks ago because im a sociopath and lets be honest: i treated her like shit. I was lying, making fun of her, trying to make her feel bad on purpouse and she WAS one of the nicest people i\u2019ve known. I just didn\u2019t deserve her. I broke her. Destroyed that innocent funny girl and made her into a female me. I hate myself for that. I couldnt stand a word she said at the end so i just got over her. Drugs were involved in my life since i was 15 and first smoked weed. She didn\u2019t like the fact that i did which was one of the reasons. Then i met this girl. She is something else let me tell ya. Crazy personality, Dark humour and listens to metal. It is an another long distance relationship but this one hurts. She takes drugs like acid so it\u2019s  harder stuff then my occasional weed. She does really stupid shit when she\u2019s on drugs and she got me into them unfortunately. We are still together but i couldnt stand her destroying her life.

Not that there\u2019s anything particularly interesting there. No tragic backstory, no great losses, just an upper middle class white guy who never faced any real hardship. Honestly, I feel like such a selfish asshole just being here talking about how sad I am when by all accounts I\u2019ve had it much better than most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m 24, still in college, still living with my parents. I don\u2019t really have a social life because I\u2019m on the autism spectrum. I have no fucking idea how to talk to people I don\u2019t already know, so making new friends has always been off the table. Even if I could make friends, I\u2019d probably just neglect these friendships until they disappear, cause I need &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of alone time. I\u2019ve had times where I barely talked to anyone for days. Back in high school, I had one childhood friend (knew him because he was the brother of my sister\u2019s best friend and he lived nearby) and I hung out with his friends by extension, but over time we drifted away, mostly because as I got more and more depressed I stopped contacting him or responding to his messages. I don\u2019t really have friends anymore. I\u2019d say the people I\u2019m closest to are my older sisters, but I don\u2019t see them all that often ever since they moved out. I always get that nagging feeling that they only hang out with me because they feel bad for me, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any truth to it or if it\u2019s just the depression talking. I\u2019m lonely, is my point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said before, I\u2019m in college, and it\u2019s not going well. I\u2019m in computer science, but I\u2019m starting to feel like that was a terrible decision. I liked it at first, but I\u2019ve been losing interest, and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because of the depression or if it\u2019s just because it was never for me in the first place. I\u2019m pretty smart, or at least I\u2019m supposed to be, and I used to have an easy time understanding all this stuff, but now it\u2019s like my brain just doesn\u2019t work anymore. I can\u2019t focus in class, I can\u2019t focus on my homework, I don\u2019t get any of the new material. It\u2019s like I just forgot how to function in school, and I don\u2019t know how to turn my brain back on again. I started failing most of my classes, tried spending a few years away from school to see if it would get better, but it didn\u2019t, and now I\u2019m failing again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling my parents are getting tired of my shit and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they kick me out. When that happens, I don\u2019t really have a plan. I have a shit part time job as a dishwasher, because it\u2019s the best I could get. I suck at interviews, and I\u2019m terrified of having to find another job. I tried doing that job full time for a while and it just made me want to die. I don\u2019t want to go back to that, but it\u2019s increasingly looking like I won\u2019t have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t really sleep anymore. Every day of my life is garbage. I\u2019m either going to school so I can not pay attention to class or fail an exam, or I\u2019m going to a shitty job that I hate. When I\u2019m at home, I\u2019m mostly playing video games, watching too many TV shows or wasting time on the internet. Anything to distract myself from the empty void my life is. I don\u2019t go to sleep because sleeping is like fast-forwarding to another shitty day where I\u2019ll have to force myself to be around people and do a bunch of stuff I hate, so instead I just stay awake at night trying to distract myself for a bit longer. Even now, I should be sleeping, but I won\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh right, did I forget to mention my gender identity issues? Couldn\u2019t have just one major psychological issue like a normal person, I had to hit the motherlode. I don\u2019t even know what I am. Can\u2019t remember anything weird from my childhood, but once I puberty, it got confusing. I started fantasizing all the time about being a girl. Didn\u2019t raise any red flags at the time; I was always fantasizing about &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; anyway, trying to distract myself by living in fantasy worlds inside my head, and this seemed like just an extension of that. Over time, it got worse. Started getting depressed, started feeling like my body was wrong, and I always knew deep down that I wasn\u2019t really a boy. Thing is, I never identified as a girl either. Can\u2019t think of myself as one. On the few times I tried being one online, I felt like an imposter. I have no idea what the fuck I am. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be a girl, but I have no idea if I\u2019ll actually be happy if I just go ahead and do it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to fit in with the girls. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to pass. I\u2019m just terrified that I\u2019d be making a huge mistake, that I\u2019d be subjecting myself to tons of hate and abuse for no reason. I want to be a girl, but I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m not really one. All I know is I hate my life as a guy, but I\u2019m too scared to move on from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there\u2019s the current climate making things worse. Transphobia is on the rise. Fascism is on the rise. If I were to transition, it feels like things are about to get drastically worse for everyone like me. Every time I go online, I see all the hate, and I don\u2019t get it. It feels like everyone hates me, without even knowing that it\u2019s me specifically that they hate, and I just want to know why. I just want to know what\u2019s so wrong with me. And it\u2019s not just the transphobia, it feels like everything\u2019s getting worse. The environment is getting fucked, the economy is getting fucked. It feels like the world is collapsing in on itself, like the end of the world is near, and all the people in power are actively working to make it happen, and a scarily large portion of the population is cheering for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don\u2019t really see a reason to keep living anymore. My personal life keeps getting worse, my mental state keeps getting worse, the world around me keeps getting worse, and there\u2019s nothing I can do about any of it, and I feel ashamed of being such a fucking screwup when I\u2019ve had everything handed to me on a silver platter. I was headed for a comfortable, successful life, and my brain just had to horribly misfire and make me fuck everything up. I can\u2019t see my future anymore. When I try imagining where I\u2019ll be in a few years, it\u2019s just blank. I don\u2019t see my situation ever getting any better. I feel like things are just going to get worse and worse until I get desperate and kill myself, and when I think about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, I just start thinking about how much easier to it would be to just end it now. When I\u2019m walking to work, I think about how easy it would be to jump in front of a truck, about how I\u2019d rather do that than go through another shift at that shitty job. When I\u2019m alone at home, I think about leaving to jump off a bridge. The only reason I haven\u2019t done it yet is that I\u2019m still more scared of death than I am of the current state of my life. I don\u2019t believe in an afterlife, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be \u201cat peace\u201d after death, I think there\u2019s nothing and I\u2019ll just stop existing, and \u201cnothing\u201d still scares me. I don\u2019t know how long being afraid of death can keep me going when I\u2019ve got nothing else going for me and everything keeps steadily getting worse. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll actually do it at some point, and I don\u2019t know when.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

My name&amp;#39;s David and I&amp;#39;m 17 and I&amp;#39;ve decided yesterday that I&amp;#39;ll kill myself before the end of the year. \nToday I remembered about this subreddit and I thought I might as well give it a try. \nHere&amp;#39;s a tl;dr of my story:\nEverything started when I moved in the middle of the elementary school, I was 11yo, I had changed the school and all the kids were harassing me in like all the posible ways. Mostly beating me up. One year later my father was killed with a knife. Then same happend in junior high school (that&amp;#39;s what google translate tells me, I&amp;#39;m from Poland and here we have gimnazjum).

Mostly beating me up. One year later my father was killed with a knife. Then same happend in junior high school (that's what google translate tells me, I'm from Poland and here we have gimnazjum).

He offered to let me use his place while he&amp;#39;s gone (2 weeks per month), which I thought was too good to be true, since it would be both an emotional and physical escape from my family. And, we had talked about the potential of having a long-term relationship if we both stayed in the area for another few years.

I cannot escape the pain it has caused and still causes me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sexually abused as a little girl. I remember when I was 3 yo and masturbating. I found out as an adult, that years later after the abuse the guy who did it shot himself at highway rest stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up, my dad frequented strip clubs and had many one night stands and got with hookers behind my mom\u2019s back. My mom remarried a sex addict shortly after their divorce when I was 12 and he would often hit on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At school, going through puberty, I would constantly get my butt slapped or made fun of since it was larger than other girls\u2019 my age. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I got older and I kept my virginity, my school crushes would constantly ignore me and have casual sex with my best female friends. I would hear all of the gory details from my best friends after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first boyfriend, who I was with for 5 years, he was addicted to porn. Constantly, he would ignore sex with me for porn. Especially asian porn (I\u2019m white). He later on had sex with my best friend on an overnight field trip I was not a part of. I found out on the fifth year and we split.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While trying to experience being single and independent, I was raped. A friend of a friend drugged me and fingered me against my will as I laid there and cried unable to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every guy I met in college cheated on me. Either with my roommates, casual pof fwb types, older women, etc. Just think of the dirtiest porn plot and insert it into my boyfriend\u2019s life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One guy in college tried killing me. He drugged me and beat me up. I later found out that he was gay and hooked up with his weed dealer. He had a sugar daddy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another guy in college used me and showed all of his roommates the dirty sheets we slept on right after having sex. I was mortified. I thought he wanted to be serious with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And another guy in college cheated on me with about 5 girls in one week. I read about their graphic sex acts he left for me open on his pc. He was also the one that hurt me in his shower. He came up behind me... I thought to kiss me. No, he did anal forcibly without my consent. I cried in pain and never wanted that to happen again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on I dated a guy for 3 years. He ended up becoming an alcoholic on the last year. One time he insisted I get black out drunk. I remember I couldn\u2019t move and he forced me into having sex as I lay there crying. I never mentioned it. He cheated on me with random girls off tinder on occasion and I tried to deal with it as best I could. As time progressed he would beat me up, in broad daylight, in public. One time at a public pool. No one did a single thing. They all just watched in horror as he pelted my face and tried strangling me. My clothes were falling off from struggling... I left him after that and I subsequently went homeless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While homeless and living out of a cheap car, I signed up for the army. While waiting for training, I was violently raped by an acquaintance. He pinned me down as I was screaming for help. It seemed like hours went by. I think they did because when he was finished with me the sun was up. I had bruises all over my body and I had to buy plan b for the 3x he came inside me. He told me that he had given me aids... I waited months later with anxiety to get tested (neg). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of doing a rape kit and reporting him and further delaying trainging and amplifying the amount of time being homeless, I just reported to meps 3 days later. While in-processing the nurses commented on how I looked like I had a \u201cfun night\u201d prior based on the scratches and bruises. I cried and kept my mouth shut. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In basic training I was accused of trying to sleep with males. It was a made up story and I was punished for it. The commander called me a slut to my face. Secretly, I was visiting with the chaplain weekly to discuss how I was coping with rape and scared I had aids or was pregnant. They took my rank, pay, and made me do extra duty for 2 weeks. Later on I got it all reversed but I had to graduate and inform my family attending about the disappointment of my time there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of basic, I met a guy and married him. I got pregnant. We were excited. He was bisexual and he understood my sexual trauma. He was open minded and helped me seek therapy and treatment. The army didn\u2019t like how he was \u201cgay\u201d and kicked him out on whatever they could find against him. They gave him a 3 day notice to pack up which isn\u2019t normal. I remember reporting it but nothing happened. He killed himself when I was 6 months pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I managed to date again. Got cheated on again. That ended. And then got used by a guy cheating on his fianc\u00e9... it has not been so great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then most recently... I fell in love once more since my husband left. I have never felt so betrayed in my life. I constantly question what it is about me that is wrong. He is a sex addict, I think? If that\u2019s even a thing. Whatever it is, he always chooses other girls over me and then tells me how much I mean to him right after. How he loves me and is sorry. I feel so fucked in the head. Everything is great with him when there isn\u2019t any cheating. I fell in love with someone I didn\u2019t know, I guess. With the fake him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What hurts the most about this most recent guy is that his fetish is that of slutty women... nymphos. He lusts for any girl that is promiscuous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she is a stripper or hooker or works for a breastraunt- \u201chot\u201d. If her tits are size H and she shows them off- \u201camazing.\u201d He loves when they are young and slutty too. He told me, but I did ask, what his favorite highlight reel was- a random encounter with a barely legal blonde from online. She was very slutty and rode him in the car with others watching nearby in a park. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s been on every dating site while in a relationship with me. He had over 186 girls on his snapchat he jerked off to almost daily. He even emotionally cheated on me with two slutty exs- one had sent her nudes on a phone she sold/gave to him through the mail and the other (wannabe \u201csex therapist\u201d) talked about flying him out to see her so she could give him sex lessons and she was going send him a fleshlight to boot. When I was miscarrying, he was trying to find any way possible to hide sexting with random online girls. During the hurricane, he bailed on me and ignored my phone calls. In October he made a fetlife account. This month he kept going on a site similar to reddit full of amateur women that you can message and get to know who post their photos and dirty stories... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so devalued. My whole life... has been based around sex. Sex, sex, sex. If I look hot and work out, I\u2019m a slut asking for it. If I don\u2019t have sex in the first month, I\u2019m a prude. I couldn\u2019t ever get it right. I couldn\u2019t find an inbetween. I\u2019ve never been loved and found sexually attractive all at once. Now after everything in my life, I\u2019ve gone completely vanilla. I have a very high sex drive compared to others but I am not comfortable with fetish stuff. I like love making. That\u2019s all I want. Love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now this guy... he\u2019s shown me over and over again how I am not good enough compared to slutty women. How they are better than me. And I\u2019ve never been so hurt in my life than the times that I felt slutty or used. I can\u2019t be the girl he lusts for. So he separated love and sex while with me. He got his sexual fixes elsewhere and abandoned me. He put sexual interactions with other girls first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I landed in hell after everything and I am just wandering around aimlessly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am on antidepressants and I do see a therapist. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd. It has been mentioned that I might have bpd based on my relationship history but usually doctors all disagree. But the therapy doesn\u2019t make the pain go away. It never does. I want to drown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want someone to love me so I stop wanting to drown.

I&amp;#39;m a fairly new user that has really only been active since September of this past year. I&amp;#39;m nineteen years old and I&amp;#39;m a female. I&amp;#39;m currently attending college where I am a Freshman. I&amp;#39;m studying History with a slight focus on Middle Eastern Studies and I really have an interest in the subject. I would like to think that I&amp;#39;m finally doing well with my life, but the fact of the matter is that I&amp;#39;m not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, I&amp;#39;m struggling to find a reason to WANT to stay alive these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that my life has been worse or harder than most, I would still say that it&amp;#39;s been somewhat difficult. I was exposed to evil at a young age due to the abuse that I received at the hands of my biological father. When it wasn&amp;#39;t starvation, then it was beatings, rape, or being locked away in a closet. This all happened before I was five years old and I was four years old when I went through the process of having him locked away in jail. He was found guilty of four (or five?) cases of sexual abuse and was let out of jail when I was fourteen. My grandparents bailed him out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They bailed him out AND gave him a key to the house that I lived in (which, at the time, was theirs). If this wasn&amp;#39;t bad enough, I&amp;#39;m more than positive that they &amp;quot;blame me&amp;quot; for ruining a family image. Between accusing me of stealing from them to simply harassing me, I&amp;#39;ve never felt loved by them. They, of course, dote on my sister. They&amp;#39;re willing to pay for her car, but refuse to co-sign college loans for me. I&amp;#39;m SO glad to have their support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, so that knocks out biological father and grandparents. What about my mother? Nope. She&amp;#39;s no good either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember, she has been emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive to her parents. She cheated on my stepfather and I&amp;#39;ve caught her cheating on her boyfriend various times as she used my cellphone to sext various men. If that weren&amp;#39;t bad enough, she is also a thief and has gone as far as to attempt to kill me with a speeding car before. I&amp;#39;ve never tried to blame her for her mental problems as I know she had a rough childhood and has BPD, but until she goes back on her medication, I want nothing to do with her. As far as I know, she&amp;#39;s /still/ dealing and doing drugs too. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of my family is far from helpful either. My stepfather works his ass off to make rent for himself, so I would never ask him for money. The same is true for my aunt and uncle as my baby cousin was just born in January. I can work, sure, but I have no motivation. I don&amp;#39;t even want to be at college. I hate it here. I feel so alone, so hated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up until last night, I ran a Discord server for my school. It was supposed to be a fun little thing, but it&amp;#39;s made me feel more miserable than ever. After someone left because I was being &amp;quot;too depressed&amp;quot;, I got the feeling that people were talking behind my back and took multiple steps back. From there, I went ahead and deleted the server. It&amp;#39;s been almost twenty-four hours and I&amp;#39;ve talked to noone about this. It&amp;#39;s beginning to eat me up inside. This isn&amp;#39;t the first time that I&amp;#39;ve been burnt at college either, it&amp;#39;s the third or fourth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a Freshman. In my first semester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, where does that leave me? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m currently on medication that makes me tired as fuck. It&amp;#39;s supposed to help with my (diagnosed) PTSD and GAD, but it does jack-all-shit. I still have constant nightmares and hyperviligance issues. Due to this, I&amp;#39;m always sleeping and sometimes I miss classes too. I&amp;#39;m still a great student though and I don&amp;#39;t have a single bad relationship with a teacher. I&amp;#39;m passing all classes with an A as far as I know. At the same time, however, I&amp;#39;m absolutely miserable going through college and feel like I don&amp;#39;t have support from anyone aside from my sister and close friend. I don&amp;#39;t even have more like $30 to my name and I haven&amp;#39;t paid my bill for the next semester either. At this rate, I&amp;#39;ll probably disappoint my family either way, so I feel like I should have some control in my life which is why I&amp;#39;ve honestly thought so heavily about ending it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me, however, suicide has always been a &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In spite of all my traumas (including some that aren&amp;#39;t listed above), I&amp;#39;ve never sought to harm myself. I&amp;#39;ve never cut, I&amp;#39;ve never touched a drug or alcohol, and I&amp;#39;ve never looked to harm others. I never thought that I would honestly fall to such low levels that I would want to die this badly. I&amp;#39;ve always loved life and hated myself, but now I hate life and I hate myself too. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m afraid of death and I&amp;#39;m afraid of hurting myself too. Even the thought of hurting myself makes me scared out of my mind, but so does telling someone about how I really feel. I don&amp;#39;t want to die, I don&amp;#39;t want to end up in a psychiatric ward, and I don&amp;#39;t want to live this life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that brings me here, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe, just /maybe/, there is someone here on this forum that could point me in the right direction or at least tell me what to do.

I am currently a straight A student at a vocational school, and my brain is unmatched. However, because I am somewhat disabled, I have a plan in my school to account for this. Many kids have harassed me, and some have not become my friends because of this. I am very popular in my school because I am very intelligent. The feeling starts when I leave school, and I go home. My mom always starts yelling at me or cursing at me because I cannot gain any weight or my posture is bad or some other stupid reason. Whenever she talks about any of these conditions, she does research, but she also talks about the cost spent to heal me. Every day I am feeling more and more depressed because I feel like all she does is yell and scold me. She makes me feel horrible about myself that I want to drink rat poison and get it over with. She is also thinking of me taking a year off from school. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose my friends and my knowledge! Especially at junior year, the hardest year in school. I like my friends and want to graduate to college with them. I want to become a surgeon, but mom makes me feel that I am not worthy to live or become a surgeon. She just wants me to be her prized show-dog, the kid who survived Lyme and is perfectly healthy. She keeps talking about spiritual stuff that is not real, and she keeps saying that she is an &amp;quot;evolved&amp;quot; being. I do not understand why my mother has to be a bully to me 24/7/365. She cares more about her business than me, and she calls every behavior an addiction. For example, if I am on the computer doing work, she calls it a computer addiction, even though I have tons of schoolwork every day.

I am typing this on my mothers phone which she let me use in the bathroom as she says God will kill me for what I've done to them.\n\nI'm a 17 year old 115 kg boy that wishes he never existed and doesn't know what he can do without his parents, is there a chance for me to be a normal person?

I&amp;#39;m a chameleon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember much of my youth, but I know I felt &amp;#39;different&amp;#39; at times but I couldn&amp;#39;t explain it. I remember times when I was in certain situations, I didn&amp;#39;t seem to have as much fun as other children. I remember beeing very unconfident, I&amp;#39;ve always felt something was missing but that feeling become &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; to me and until a year ago I couldn&amp;#39;t explain what is was. I&amp;#39;ve alwayw attributed everything of me lacking confidence, so I learned at a young age to &amp;#39;fake it till you make it&amp;#39;. At around 8 till 12 years I was very popular and my problems were not as bad as before, but the feelings of being inferior remained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all became worse during puberty. When others thrived I felt left behind a lot. But since you hear this is normal during puberty I didn&amp;#39;t think much of it. I acted how I thought I would be accepted the most. It kind of worked but it never satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finished high school I had to choose what to study next. I really had no idea what to study. I&amp;#39;ve took a lot of tests to figure out what I should choose but nothing really stood out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I choose something just dor the heck of it. I  knew I had a lot of potential so I didn&amp;#39;t want to throw that away. But I stopped a lot of studies and I became very isolated, from 17 till 22 years old. I had friends during high school and during school it was convenient. But I never really had a drive to maintain contact. I never missed anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just played games during that period, I just had not drive or ambition. But I neglected the bad feelings and just played games to forget my shitty situation. I still played football/soccer and that was really my only way of staying in contact with peers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 22 I started to push myself to improve myself. I studied accountancy and at this moment I&amp;#39;m finished for 99%. But I didn&amp;#39;t attend classes and studied days before my exams and I managed to pass every test. At my third year I pushed myself to attend every class. I became comfortable between my peers again but I never really enjoyed the contact, but I faked all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I pushed myself to go out two years ago I met my ex. She really seemed to like me and we texted for a while. For the first time in my life I really liked someone. She is a very pretty girl, is VERY socially minded and really sweet. I felt I won the lottery and soon we were in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our relationship opened my eyes: I feelt really good! I recognized the difference in how my &amp;#39;old&amp;#39; mood was and how I felt now. I became a lot more confident. For the first time I really felt like I was someone. Our relationship was very good. The first 6 months were like heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after those months the infatuation just wasn&amp;#39;t there anymore. It felt like a part of me died and I was the old empty feeling me again. I desperately started to question how this could happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was honest and told my girlfriend I suddenly felt nothing anymore. She was devastates. When we were discussing all of this we decided to end our relationship. But exactly at that moment I just broke and I started to cry very heavily. I somehow KNEW I loved her but I couldn&amp;#39;t feel it. We decided to continue our relationship and see how it would go. The relationship continued for about a year before we decided to pause our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put a lot of effort in improving our situation and I started to obsessively searching for answers. I started to research on the internet, started asking questions to people to compare situations. I initially thought it was all due to depression. So I started taking AD but nothing worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The extreme introspection and researching offered me some answers. I managed to discover a lot of handicaps of me. Somehow I never was aware of these handicaps before, I think because I&amp;#39;ve been this way for as long as I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, my handicaps include: I can&amp;#39;t miss people, I can&amp;#39;t love people like normal people can. I never knew people felt empathy. I can recognize facial expressions extremely well. I always thought people just said &amp;#39;I feel your pain&amp;#39; to act in a supportive way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel empty most of the time. I recognize I don&amp;#39;t really enjoy things like most people do but I do them to keep me busy. Like how the hell wasn&amp;#39;t I aware of that? I have a limited amount of emotions. I can be sad, angry, content and scared but not a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have aphantasia. I can&amp;#39;t relive moments of my past, I remember those as facts. I can&amp;#39;t visualize my future. I can&amp;#39;t picture my parents faces in my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a lack of sense of selve. The relationship caused me to feel &amp;#39;whole&amp;#39; because the infatuation fills a void. But after infatuation ends, the void is back. The lack of sense of selve causes people to feel empty, have no real direction in life etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recognise a lot of behaviours of mine were toxic in my relationship. When everything went well I put her on a pedestal. When she forgot to text me goodnight I felt very anxious, like she didn&amp;#39;t love me any longer. Feelings of &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; changed in feelings of &amp;#39;hate&amp;#39; when she behaved in ways I didn&amp;#39;t like. I became scared she would realize I am boring whrn she spent time with friends and she no longer needed me. To counter this I obsessively kept treating her like a princess to make her feel special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of these behaviours and traits are explainable by quiet borderline. May it be borderline or bot, it leaves me feeling trapped. Trapped in a life with too many handicaps I am born with. I never will have a normal life, something I pursued my whole life. I will never be able to enjoy life like most people. I will never be able to connect with people in a genuine way or love people in a genuine way. I will never have a real strong personality because my lack of sense of self. I feel like I am an innocent prisoner with a life sentence and when I look out of my window I see people experiencing all the things life has to offer that I am unable to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in therapy already and I have talked a lot about this with my mother but the only thing that seems possible is to &amp;#39;just accept all of this and live life as fullest a I can&amp;#39;. But I don&amp;#39;t see this as living, it&amp;#39;s survival. There is nothing in my life that is worth living for. Sure I do have better days, but when I try to forget all of this I just keep being reminded by all of this when I feel empty when in a group, when I don&amp;#39;t feel joy when I do things etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried a lot of things. I&amp;#39;ve spend more than 1000 euros on supplements to exclude nutritional defficiencies, I&amp;#39;ve tried anti-depressants, mindfullness, meditation and so many other things. I&amp;#39;ve stayed positive and try to think of it like something treatable like depression, anhedonia etc. But options are running out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year I thought of suicide occasionally. I&amp;#39;ve had onr attempt to hang myself but didn&amp;#39;t pull trough. The thing is: I don&amp;#39;t want to die, but I don&amp;#39;t want to live this life. I recognize all the beautiful things life has to offer, but if I can&amp;#39;t experience those things I keep feeling cursed. I know it may sound selfish because people who love me will be hurt, but after a while they will continue their lives. I don&amp;#39;t want to continue to live just for others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi..\n\n\nI'm a 27 year old male.

To counter this I obsessively kept treating her like a princess to make her feel special.\n\n\nA lot of these behaviours and traits are explainable by quiet borderline. May it be borderline or bot, it leaves me feeling trapped. Trapped in a life with too many handicaps I am born with. I never will have a normal life, something I pursued my whole life. I will never be able to enjoy life like most people. I will never be able to connect with people in a genuine way or love people in a genuine way. I will never have a real strong personality because my lack of sense of self. I feel like I am an innocent prisoner with a life sentence and when I look out of my window I see people experiencing all the things life has to offer that I am unable to.\n\n\nI am in therapy already and I have talked a lot about this with my mother but the only thing that seems possible is to 'just accept all of this and live life as fullest a I can'. But I don't see this as living, it's survival. There is nothing in my life that is worth living for. Sure I do have better days, but when I try to forget all of this I just keep being reminded by all of this when I feel empty when in a group, when I don't feel joy when I do things etc.\n\n\nI've tried a lot of things. I've spend more than 1000 euros on supplements to exclude nutritional defficiencies, I've tried anti-depressants, mindfullness, meditation and so many other things. I've stayed positive and try to think of it like something treatable like depression, anhedonia etc. But options are running out.\n\n\nLast year I thought of suicide occasionally. I've had onr attempt to hang myself but didn't pull trough. The thing is: I don't want to die, but I don't want to live this life. I recognize all the beautiful things life has to offer, but if I can't experience those things I keep feeling cursed. I know it may sound selfish because people who love me will be hurt, but after a while they will continue their lives. I don't want to continue to live just for others.\n\n\nThanks for reading...", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hqznl", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "No real reason to go on", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hqznl", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hqznl/no_real_reason_to_go_on/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512521832.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hqznl/no_real_reason_to_go_on/", "author_flair_text": "", "quarantine": false, "author": "Uitzichtloos", "created_utc": 1512493032.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just have a sudden STRONG urge to hurt myself.

FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had (? I am not sure what i felt -???Anxiety attack??? )and the thoughts felt so real like I am feeling the same way, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. I was relatively fine. I was sleepy. As I was smoking I suddently looked in the place where we are keeping the knives and imagined getting a knife and s...... I got intense strike in the stomach and like an urge to do it, it felt real. Then I tried to calm my self but the thought &amp;quot;Life is meaningless&amp;quot; with somekind of weird ??future?? feeling came. The strike in the stomach became more intense, I immediately went to my room. I was no longer sleeping, and started googling about suicidal thoughts/suicidality.\nToday I woke up with low mood and the pictures of yesterday stuck in my head, with a weird stomach feeling.\nAlso while I am writing this there is a feeling/thoughts that I just don&amp;#39;t want to admit it. And a confusion if I am suicidal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a psychiatrist, and told him about the throughts. He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much symptoms of depression.\nBut I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can&amp;#39;t tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don&amp;#39;t. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don&amp;#39;t get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF?\nAlso when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can&amp;#39;t ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don&amp;#39;t want to get better makes me more terrified. Does that sound like Active SI?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,\u00a0no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don&amp;#39;t think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime i post on reddit i feel like i missed something....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I sound suicidal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,\u00a0have a good night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello\u00a0reddit!\n\nFirst of all I am 19 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family.

And since I work and live remotely I don&amp;#39;t really have friends other then these two who have always been there for the past 3 years even when I am isolated.

Then after I paid for it she changed her mind and she didn&amp;#39;t want to meet me. So I booked a flight to Croatia as soon as I land in Poland after talking with my friend in Zagreb, and she said she&amp;#39;d like to meet and we can hang out on weekends and spend some weeknights together. After landing in Zagreb and catching a taxi to where she studies, I waited till she finished but unfortunately she wasn&amp;#39;t there.

I was relying on her to show me around, and it was really the whole reason I came was to spend time with my two friends and they ended up both blocking me. It was my fault, I would get angry about the situation and take my anger out on them and I think they had every right to block me and never talk to me again.

I\u2019m a college student in my senior year about to graduate in May. On the outside, everything in my life seems fine. I\u2019ve got good grades, I go to class, I turn in my homework, I\u2019m good looking, I think, just a regular guy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can\u2019t even remember the last time I was happy. When I was a kid my parents fought and screamed at each other all day every day, so I got away as much as possible. I would bike 5-6 miles just to go to the movie theatre and escape. In high school I ran cross country and track, and I was a normal student, but I didn\u2019t really have any friends but one. There was one kid who I had known my entire life, literally my best and only friend, but one day he learned when our family was on vacation and broke into our house, stealing a lot of money and trashing the place. He admitted to doing it, and I remember holding my little brother in bed who was crying because he thought that someone was going to break in again. My parents were too busy fighting to care I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I had no friends, and it was so hard to meet anyone. Now I think that maybe I have trust issues like I only see the worst in people or something. I can\u2019t get near anyone because everyone I\u2019ve ever been close to has left or doesn\u2019t care about me. No one but me. I was really down for a long time, and no one cared. One night I was at the house alone and I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and I don\u2019t know what I was thinking, I just wanted it all to stop so I didn\u2019t have to cry anymore. My mother came home and found me right then, like the worst timing in the world, and I was crying with a knife and I told her what I was doing. She made me see this counselor woman, but I refused to talk to her. They sat me in front of some fat, rich, stupid, privileged woman who knew nothing about me and expected me to talk or something, but I just sat there not saying a word for every meeting she made me do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to college, and it was more of the same. I have no friends. I go to class, do my homework, and sit in my room. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s fucking wrong with me but sometimes I hurt myself or go on a walk and punch a brick wall until its covered in blood from my hand. I barely eat anything anymore, I\u2019m pretty sure I have anorexia. I\u2019m 5 foot 10 inches and weigh about 110 pounds. Last year I went too long without eating and passed out, hitting my head on the floor pretty bad. I woke up in the hospital and it took me 6 months to recover. It\u2019s just getting worse. I don\u2019t want to be around anymore, but I\u2019m too much of a pussy to kill myself. I\u2019ve tried everything, hanging, cutting, co-2 with a car. I just can\u2019t fucking do it. I don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t know what would make me happy. I guess I just want someone to love me. But no one ever has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met a girl last year in school and we hit it off. I\u2019m still a virgin and I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, so I\u2019m a bit shy, but I\u2019m pretty good looking, so I went for it. For a while things were great, I worked up the nerve to tell her I liked her, and she told me she liked me back. We would sit up all night watching bad movies and talking until the morning. This went on for a while. One day I worked up the courage to tell her I wanted to kiss her and we did, (first kiss at 20 years old is pathetic, I know) and I asked her out. She said no and just left. All the time we spent just wasted. All the times she told me she liked me were a lie I guess. It was crushing. The first friend I\u2019ve made in years just gone. But that\u2019s what I get for putting myself out there. Just like my old friend when I was young.

My father never said he loved me, only in texts he did but never in real life. My mother said she loved me but never meant it. I&amp;#39;ve had friends in real life but I soon got homeschooled because people where talking about me behind my backs and the school pretty much sucked.

For the past weeks, I haven\u2019t been able to sleep till around five in the morning. I know I\u2019m an insomniac, and because I have epilepsy, I\u2019ve been given Clonazepam on top of the Depakote I have already been taking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday, I wake up late, feel like total shit, and am just generally having a ton of stress, anxiety, and depression filling my head.  It\u2019s been around 9 months since I broke up with my first girlfriend whom I dated and lived with for 2 years.  She recently blocked me on everything, because of some more mistakes I can add to my list of fuck ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll be 22 years old this month, and I know how young that is in the scheme of life, but I also know that we can all die at any random moment throughout the day, so everything seems so pointless.  Because of my seizures, my arms are almost unusable, as they dislocate just by waking up or stretching at times.  My memory is also incredibly messed up, and it\u2019s became a noticeable problem in my life, that also affects others.  Every morning, I wake up depressed, and instantly feeling suicidal.  When I lay in bed, I constantly think of the knife I own and how easily I could use it to end things.  Trying to OD on my pills again is another route that is right at my disposal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know how people say that life is a gift, and I agree with that. I also know that people have it way worse than me.

I know I\u2019m an insomniac, and because I have epilepsy, I\u2019ve been given Clonazepam on top of the Depakote I have already been taking.\n\n\nEveryday, I wake up late, feel like total shit, and am just generally having a ton of stress, anxiety, and depression filling my head.  It\u2019s been around 9 months since I broke up with my first girlfriend whom I dated and lived with for 2 years.  She recently blocked me on everything, because of some more mistakes I can add to my list of fuck ups.\n\n\nI\u2019ll be 22 years old this month, and I know how young that is in the scheme of life, but I also know that we can all die at any random moment throughout the day, so everything seems so pointless.  Because of my seizures, my arms are almost unusable, as they dislocate just by waking up or stretching at times.  My memory is also incredibly messed up, and it\u2019s became a noticeable problem in my life, that also affects others.  Every morning, I wake up depressed, and instantly feeling suicidal.  When I lay in bed, I constantly think of the knife I own and how easily I could use it to end things.  Trying to OD on my pills again is another route that is right at my disposal. \n\n\nI know how people say that life is a gift, and I agree with that. I also know that people have it way worse than me.

My outward life is a gross mirror of my inward one, and I seem to warp social interactions in my characteristic way, like a bowling ball warps bowling pins. I can not be anywhere without myself tagging along. blah, blah, blah. There's worse shit to mention, but I think the tone of this is what's important. Considering that I don't care if I die, should I say fuck it? Change seems unlikely. I've got no responsibilities, no kids or anything heavy. I am not depressed as far as I can tell, other than grossed out I don't feel much of anything. Ashamed. Both my parents were dead before I was born, and I have no siblings or anyone who would have to carry around the burden of a dead relative. I've only ever had shallow friendships, which is all I'm capeable of, so I wouldn't be breaking any platonic hearts. I have no resentments or ill-will, nothing even close. I just am not somebody I want to be, and I also don't want to be anyone else.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7holg3", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Space gangsters from Mars", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7holg3", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7holg3/space_gangsters_from_mars/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512494743.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7holg3/space_gangsters_from_mars/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1512465943.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;my friend has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for 10+ years and has tried to kill himself at least twice that he&amp;#39;s told me of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he has a lot of financial stress, his family took him to an inpatient care thing once and the hospital kept him there for 3 days and charged him him a huge bill that he can&amp;#39;t pay and his family won&amp;#39;t help him &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;besides this he has just had a really really terrible hard life and struggles with mental illness as well.

suicide, when to do it and where, most importantly how. i\u2019ve got multiple drafts of letters lined up, i decided i want to overdose on acetaminophen after noting drowning or slitting my wrists might be too painful (as i want to avoid pain) and can be interrupted. i\u2019ve also determined that i would like to road trip by myself to a beach and watch the ocean with the moon and stars above me, a beautiful scene to behold before i die. i\u2019ve also never done that before, see the beach at night. haven\u2019t seen a beach in person in a few years now, like six. i was planning on taking my life June of 2018, gives the weather time to heat up i could turn nineteen and i could change my mind...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but right now i don\u2019t want to wait. and i hate that because i really love sticking to plans. ive told my mother and sister about my cuts and they don\u2019t seem to care in the way i thought they would. they don\u2019t bother to hide knives and they give me razors willingly as if they want me to bleed. i told my mother i think i have depression i hate school i have been so tired sleeping through classes and not doing work though she thinks i\u2019m selfish. my sister and i are flat broke and honestly our family can only afford to send one of us to grad school in 2019 and it should be her.  i think she deserves it more, plus she knows of my plan and doesn\u2019t seem bothered at all. i don\u2019t think she believes me. there are moments where i am happy but it\u2019s almost always for someone else and i just don\u2019t think i can do it anymore. it\u2019s clear to me that no one takes me seriously and there\u2019s no room for me anywhere. everyone can go on with their lives, no ones counting on me waking up. my best friend in the whole world has stopped talking to me because i thought he liked me that we were going to be something more and i ruined everything. he was the one person who i could call when i felt like this, but now we don\u2019t talk and he\u2019s got a girlfriend and his birthday is in a couple weeks, just before mine. i don\u2019t want to ruin anything else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i am afraid of what i might do to myself when left alone. i have to distribute letters, let my english teacher know her class was the only thing i looked forward to and now it\u2019s ending, i have to get the drugs and plan my trip, and lastly i have to complete final exams and projects. i\u2019m working with people and i don\u2019t want to let them down, or have them think i don\u2019t care about their grades, they shouldn\u2019t suffer because of me. i\u2019ve considered trying to go to a facility but i would still be leaving before i could contribute. and i don\u2019t know what my family would say. i also

I also for some reason considered myself to have a strong will and determination. The only caveat is over the years my procrastination has increased, at first i just thought it was my interests changing but at the age of 22 I realized that its procrastination and that procrastination comes from fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of times when things went wrong I&amp;#39;d consider myself to be unlucky, I always was the person to make multiple plans (fear of failure) so i never really worried I thought it was natural to keep jumping around.\nI really love music so my mother got me a piano, i hated lessons after school so i quit, when i was older i picked it up again but this time i just stopped. Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was always interested in science and maths when i was in primary (junior for the usa) i was moved up grades in maths, i remember i was inlove with my teacher so much so and i worked hard to get into her class my young boy heart asked her to marry me and she rejected me.(rightly so) she was not only getting married but leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never found myself good at maths again, I always tell my friends and family that story as a joke to explain why i am bad at maths. But on the deep inspection into my life, I actually do enjoy maths still.\nCurrently I found myself working out the percentage loss at the job i work for limiting its online orders for 2 week, even though i am not in management I just found the question &amp;quot;how much did (company) lose during this 2 week period&amp;quot; There are loads of other examples but i have discovered I do love maths and I wish i had been more involved in it at school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember I&amp;#39;d sleep at my school desk and I went from top set to when i was taking my GCSE&amp;#39;S being in the 2nd to lowest set with my predicted grade being a F. I got a D because i revised hard for 1 month but w/e still not a pass.\nBut i loved the revision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;back to science this odd behaviour begins to take place, I&amp;#39;d get really good at something and love doing it. then over time just stop caring my actions of (ill do the hw later) or (do i even really want this as a future career) , i thought at the time as i said before my interests changed.\nbut it was the same for drama I got all A*\nsame for film studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a neuro biologist but I was told it would be hard, this would be the same time you&amp;#39;d notice the decline in my effort. While an a younger me would start by saying (i still love biology) eventually a year later i&amp;#39;d have said &amp;quot;i just think i want to keep it as a hobby&amp;quot;\nbecause everything that I really liked just became &amp;quot;hobbies&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when i was 17 i was accepted for an apprenticeship at a design studio and it all happened again, and after i recieved my qualifications the same &amp;quot;i think its just a hobby to me&amp;quot; came out, even though i had shown talent in both design and video editing.\nGaming, i was the best player in the world at a more niche game and wanted to transition to a more prominent game like star craft 2 or league of legends. But then after the initial excitement i gave up on starcraft saying &amp;quot;its a really good game its everything i&amp;#39;d like but I just dont really have time for it, it seems like its dying&amp;quot;\nThen for league &amp;quot;its just too casual&amp;quot;\nbut why? I qualified gold in both after playing for a few days not saying im terrible but all my friends qualified bronze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know i am a try hard, I remember looking up guides and finding the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; strategies a the time so i know i might not just be natural game wizz but I put a lot of effort into those qualifying games.\nbut it all fizzled out to nothing.\nSo you can see where I am going with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RELATIONSHIPS&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never been the kind of person to be interested in a girl who isn&amp;#39;t interested in me, I don&amp;#39;t know if i have just been lucky all my life or if i have some inate biological calling to find ppl who desire my genetic code either way thats been the case in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said i am no play boy I&amp;#39;ve only been in 3 relationships and the last one that started when i was 20 which ended 3 days ago was the longest one that had me come to this deep reflection.\nI always thought there was something weird about my life, ever since i came to the conclusion &amp;quot;everytime something interesting is going to happen ill meet a girl&amp;quot; this could be as a friend or potential love interest.\nAnd while this is true isn&amp;#39;t it strange that once I noticed this &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot; it became unequivocally true? Lets take me getting an apprenticeship it was actually a girl in maths remidial classes that suggested i look for one.\nLets look at my time in 6th form I hated it but I met this girl who made the year i was there great and when things between us didnt work I left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you can see the trend here at my apprenticeship there was another girl, we&amp;#39;d do coursework together became good friends for the duration of the apprenticeship.\nI just thought well this is my life girls are a key factor of my life... But is this coincidence? Is it truly something magical or is there something else going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A game i was really good at had a sequal and one of the older players from the original game wasn&amp;#39;t just a girl she was just my type, she would be my last relationship and the one i cherished the most.\nI&amp;#39;d always say I just hear this voice or get this feeling that something is gonna happen and it usually happens.\nI remember watching an alan watts video and he said &amp;quot;you get exactly what you want out of life&amp;quot;\nI laughed at that, I thought nah a lot of shit has happened to me that I dont want.\nWhy am i not good at the piano why do i have a lot of failed relationships (before i met my most recent ex) Why this why that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d blame certain things for that to me were stoping me from being succesful. Now its not to say these WERENT true, and its not to say these were even okay to have.\nBut the same way i&amp;#39;d have whispers or feelings about positive things isn&amp;#39;t it interesting that i had the same for negative?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i first met the girl I talked about in sixth form I remember she said &amp;quot;will we be friends for ever&amp;quot; jokingly we had just started talking, and I said &amp;quot;We wont even be friends this time next year&amp;quot; it was a joke but as soon as I said it i felt different. Like i had &amp;quot;jinxed it&amp;quot; like it was true and well everything between us ended 1week before that time next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every single thing in my life that i had that feeling or whisper as I called it has happened. Strange right? mystical maybe im psychic but even then I knew that wasn&amp;#39;t true.\nI just assumed i was really good at reading people and situations.\nWell i think i have finally arrived at the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my girlfriend of 2 years who loved me more than any other girl, literally would have died for me at a point in time cheated on me and told me I wasn&amp;#39;t enough for her.\nI look back and I see the recurring theme, when we first started dating and throughout it I had felt like she didn&amp;#39;t love me or she would stop loving me and that she would cheat on me not like a major doubt and nothing in her actions. But it was the whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whisper that appears after a good moment to bring negativity or after a bad moment to bring positivity.\nI realize that its me who is causing all this to happen in my life. When I sit down and analysise my last relationship and all the things i &amp;quot;quit&amp;quot; and why i quit them. While yes some things were true and not part of my control WHAT lead to those situations in the first place was me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my girlfriend cheated on me, sounds pretty bad right? Fuck her right?\nI mean yes she is in control of herself, how we act when no one is looking speaks volumes but its not like she did this recently. She never looked at guys ever she only had eyes for me actually she told me she thought it was unhealthy about how much she obsessed over me and I was her first love.\nHow did it go from that to this? Well i&amp;#39;ll tell you. It started with me pushing her away, treating her badly, our favourite pass times together became things I made us avoid.\nMy charm of finding out her interests and getting involved and involving her with mine became me shutting her out and ignoring her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy she cheated with, i literally told her to spend more time with because I was busy. So there is a context. Should she have let them get so close while in a relationship with me? No ofc not. But did my actions help in anyway No they had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like with all my previous passions i started of trying really hard with my girlfriend and then without even noticing it I just took her forgranted and let it all go.\n6months ago she told me she didn&amp;#39;t love me but didn&amp;#39;t want to lose me so Again i tried really hard to build up that love but once things seemed good again. I can literally thinking about it see how I just slipped into my old ways and then the cheating happened.\nSo she even knew she was losing feelings and tried to work with me to get them back before she cheated. So what is really going on here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woe is me I am so unlucky? or Is it something else.\nLooking at the life i have lived, every &amp;quot;whisper&amp;quot; only happened because I wanted it to.\nTo meet a new girl when something interesting is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is i&amp;#39;d meet a girl then do something new, new things are more interesting than old things.\n&amp;quot;shes going to stop loving me and cheat on me&amp;quot;\nthe reality is I stopped being the good boyfriend i was and literally pushed her towards another man.\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to find the job of my dreams&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well actually i did an indepth search for a small design studio that has the same style and goals i had, also in an area which would have probably similar minded people... I marketed myself to them how I thought they would want and.... yeah I got the apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will end up hating this job&amp;quot;\nI stopped working on the things I wanted to do and never once asked to try to do what i wanted, I became complacent and then frustrated with my own complacency rather than fixing that.\n&amp;quot;If i have nothing going on in my life when im 22 i&amp;#39;m going to kill myself&amp;quot;\nAll of the above lead to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;theres so much more but u get the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While there were undoubtedly negative things. looking at it from a goal orientated perspective, i never should have quit the job early, I should have tried my hardest in my relationship and then even harder when i was trying to get back her feelings. Theres obviously loads of details i left out that would hammer this point home. but I think you get the jist&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am literally destroying myself then building myself back up again, only for it to be worse than last time.\nThis isn&amp;#39;t random chance, I&amp;#39;m not unlucky. Its me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother stole 25k from me but at the same time I left it in a place where she could steal it and also knew she had a gambling problem. Should she have stole it? No? DID MY ACTIONS HELP?\nNO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i am my own worst enemy and I don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m going to change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was 15 years old when I was sitting on the steps of my school with my friends talking about our future&amp;#39;s in life and i said &amp;quot;if i have nothing going on in my life when im 22 I&amp;#39;m going to kill myself&amp;quot;\nI have never forgotten that moment, I remember how the sunset, how it was a mid summer evening and how there was this cooling breeze and ominious vibe immidiately after i said it.\nBut why do i remember that moment? I dont remember anything else really from that time period. Why do i ALWAYS think about that moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why is it a reality now? Why has everything in my life and my actions lead to this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it random chance? was I psychic? No. like alan watts said &amp;quot;you get out of life what you want&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I secretly want to destroy myself to destroy everything. To commit suicide when im 22. Thats why I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten that memory thats why I can&amp;#39;t imagine reaching my 23rd birthday.\nThats why this heart break is too much to bare because i don&amp;#39;t think i am capable of changing.\nI want my girlfriend back but I dont want someone who doesn&amp;#39;t love me. I don&amp;#39;t know if I can or if i even should.\nI dont want the history we made to be just that history.\nI don&amp;#39;t like how my life is worse than when i met her.\nI look at the situations I get into and i cant see this ending, so what if i meet another girl I&amp;#39;m going to get another &amp;quot;whisper&amp;quot; and subconsciously follow it to reality.\nI don&amp;#39;t want this anymore and I have no clue what to do or at least I do know what to do but I don&amp;#39;t think i can do it.\nThat fear is so strong now the fear of failure and the procrastination that comes with it. I feel chained to this fate i setup for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like death is the only option and isn&amp;#39;t it strange I no longer have any underlying finger, not something telling me to do it i have nothing. There is no whisper for the future everything is completely uncertain. But that makes it feel even more like the end. For my whole life i have listened to it and now its not here anymore.\ni hope to make it to my 23rd birthday I want to see what its like for something the &amp;quot;whisper/feeling&amp;quot;to not be true but thats in April and with the way things are I don&amp;#39;t think I will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*I hate the fact that the only reason my ex is currently talking to me is because she thinks I&amp;#39;m suicidal, I know none of her feelings are genuine, why do we talk more now than when we were together? I know as soon as she is ready to move on or thinks im secure she is going to leave.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I could find another person make new memories I could do much more in life, but at the end of the day if in 4/8/10/20/40 years I&amp;#39;m back in this position again. What is the point its going to hurt much more than it does now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thats the thing about life it wouldn&amp;#39;t be so bad if you could undo, redo. But i can&amp;#39;t im only getting older and things are getting harder and harder. I feel this may be the last chance to make something of my life but ultimately I don&amp;#39;t even know if i should take it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is how it was always meant to be. like all the other people who committed suicide before me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;#39;m just working to give my mother as I forgive her for stealing the  money, I do love her and I want her to be financially secure when i&amp;#39;m gone. I think i&amp;#39;m going to live long enough to play the game of my dreams Monster Hunter World and then i&amp;#39;m going to commit suicide after I complete it.

I got a D because i revised hard for 1 month but w/e still not a pass.\nBut i loved the revision.\n\n\nback to science this odd behaviour begins to take place, I'd get really good at something and love doing it. then over time just stop caring my actions of (ill do the hw later) or (do i even really want this as a future career) , i thought at the time as i said before my interests changed.\nbut it was the same for drama I got all A*\nsame for film studies.\n\nI wanted to be a neuro biologist but I was told it would be hard, this would be the same time you'd notice the decline in my effort. While an a younger me would start by saying (i still love biology) eventually a year later i'd have said \"i just think i want to keep it as a hobby\"\nbecause everything that I really liked just became \"hobbies\"\n\nI remember when i was 17 i was accepted for an apprenticeship at a design studio and it all happened again, and after i recieved my qualifications the same \"i think its just a hobby to me\" came out, even though i had shown talent in both design and video editing.\nGaming, i was the best player in the world at a more niche game and wanted to transition to a more prominent game like star craft 2 or league of legends. But then after the initial excitement i gave up on starcraft saying \"its a really good game its everything i'd like but I just dont really have time for it, it seems like its dying\"\nThen for league \"its just too casual\"\nbut why? I qualified gold in both after playing for a few days not saying im terrible but all my friends qualified bronze.\n\n\nI know i am a try hard, I remember looking up guides and finding the \"best\" strategies a the time so i know i might not just be natural game wizz but I put a lot of effort into those qualifying games.\nbut it all fizzled out to nothing.\nSo you can see where I am going with this.\n\nRELATIONSHIPS\n\nI have never been the kind of person to be interested in a girl who isn't interested in me, I don't know if i have just been lucky all my life or if i have some inate biological calling to find ppl who desire my genetic code either way thats been the case in my life.\n\nThat being said i am no play boy I've only been in 3 relationships and the last one that started when i was 20 which ended 3 days ago was the longest one that had me come to this deep reflection.\nI always thought there was something weird about my life, ever since i came to the conclusion \"everytime something interesting is going to happen ill meet a girl\" this could be as a friend or potential love interest.\nAnd while this is true isn't it strange that once I noticed this \"trend\" it became unequivocally true? Lets take me getting an apprenticeship it was actually a girl in maths remidial classes that suggested i look for one.\nLets look at my time in 6th form I hated it but I met this girl who made the year i was there great and when things between us didnt work I left.\n\n\nyou can see the trend here at my apprenticeship there was another girl, we'd do coursework together became good friends for the duration of the apprenticeship.\nI just thought well this is my life girls are a key factor of my life... But is this coincidence? Is it truly something magical or is there something else going on.\n\n\nA game i was really good at had a sequal and one of the older players from the original game wasn't just a girl she was just my type, she would be my last relationship and the one i cherished the most.\nI'd always say I just hear this voice or get this feeling that something is gonna happen and it usually happens.\nI remember watching an alan watts video and he said \"you get exactly what you want out of life\"\nI laughed at that, I thought nah a lot of shit has happened to me that I dont want.\nWhy am i not good at the piano why do i have a lot of failed relationships (before i met my most recent ex) Why this why that.\n\n\nI'd blame certain things for that to me were stoping me from being succesful. Now its not to say these WERENT true, and its not to say these were even okay to have.\nBut the same way i'd have whispers or feelings about positive things isn't it interesting that i had the same for negative?\n\n\nWhen i first met the girl I talked about in sixth form I remember she said \"will we be friends for ever\" jokingly we had just started talking, and I said \"We wont even be friends this time next year\" it was a joke but as soon as I said it i felt different. Like i had \"jinxed it\" like it was true and well everything between us ended 1week before that time next year.\n\n\nEvery single thing in my life that i had that feeling or whisper as I called it has happened. Strange right? mystical maybe im psychic but even then I knew that wasn't true.\nI just assumed i was really good at reading people and situations.\nWell i think i have finally arrived at the truth.\n\n\nAfter my girlfriend of 2 years who loved me more than any other girl, literally would have died for me at a point in time cheated on me and told me I wasn't enough for her.\nI look back and I see the recurring theme, when we first started dating and throughout it I had felt like she didn't love me or she would stop loving me and that she would cheat on me not like a major doubt and nothing in her actions. But it was the whisper.\n\n\nThe whisper that appears after a good moment to bring negativity or after a bad moment to bring positivity.\nI realize that its me who is causing all this to happen in my life. When I sit down and analysise my last relationship and all the things i \"quit\" and why i quit them. While yes some things were true and not part of my control WHAT lead to those situations in the first place was me.\n\n\nSo my girlfriend cheated on me, sounds pretty bad right? Fuck her right?\nI mean yes she is in control of herself, how we act when no one is looking speaks volumes but its not like she did this recently. She never looked at guys ever she only had eyes for me actually she told me she thought it was unhealthy about how much she obsessed over me and I was her first love.\nHow did it go from that to this? Well i'll tell you. It started with me pushing her away, treating her badly, our favourite pass times together became things I made us avoid.\nMy charm of finding out her interests and getting involved and involving her with mine became me shutting her out and ignoring her.\n\n\nThe guy she cheated with, i literally told her to spend more time with because I was busy. So there is a context. Should she have let them get so close while in a relationship with me? No ofc not. But did my actions help in anyway No they had the opposite effect.\n\n\nJust like with all my previous passions i started of trying really hard with my girlfriend and then without even noticing it I just took her forgranted and let it all go.\n6months ago she told me she didn't love me but didn't want to lose me so Again i tried really hard to build up that love but once things seemed good again. I can literally thinking about it see how I just slipped into my old ways and then the cheating happened.\nSo she even knew she was losing feelings and tried to work with me to get them back before she cheated. So what is really going on here?\n\n\nWoe is me I am so unlucky? or Is it something else.\nLooking at the life i have lived, every \"whisper\" only happened because I wanted it to.\nTo meet a new girl when something interesting is going to happen.\n\nThe reality is i'd meet a girl then do something new, new things are more interesting than old things.\n\"shes going to stop loving me and cheat on me\"\nthe reality is I stopped being the good boyfriend i was and literally pushed her towards another man.\n\"I'm going to find the job of my dreams\"\n\nWell actually i did an indepth search for a small design studio that has the same style and goals i had, also in an area which would have probably similar minded people... I marketed myself to them how I thought they would want and.... yeah I got the apprenticeship\n\n\"I will end up hating this job\"\nI stopped working on the things I wanted to do and never once asked to try to do what i wanted, I became complacent and then frustrated with my own complacency rather than fixing that.\n\"If i have nothing going on in my life when im 22 i'm going to kill myself\"\nAll of the above lead to this.\n\n\ntheres so much more but u get the point.\n\n\nWhile there were undoubtedly negative things. looking at it from a goal orientated perspective, i never should have quit the job early, I should have tried my hardest in my relationship and then even harder when i was trying to get back her feelings. Theres obviously loads of details i left out that would hammer this point home. but I think you get the jist\n\n\nI am literally destroying myself then building myself back up again, only for it to be worse than last time.\nThis isn't random chance, I'm not unlucky. Its me.\n\nMy mother stole 25k from me but at the same time I left it in a place where she could steal it and also knew she had a gambling problem. Should she have stole it? No? DID MY ACTIONS HELP?\nNO.\n\n\ni am my own worst enemy and I don't know if i'm going to change.\n\n\nI was 15 years old when I was sitting on the steps of my school with my friends talking about our future's in life and i said \"if i have nothing going on in my life when im 22 I'm going to kill myself\"\nI have never forgotten that moment, I remember how the sunset, how it was a mid summer evening and how there was this cooling breeze and ominious vibe immidiately after i said it.\nBut why do i remember that moment? I dont remember anything else really from that time period. Why do i ALWAYS think about that moment.\n\n\nAnd why is it a reality now? Why has everything in my life and my actions lead to this?\n\n\nIs it random chance? was I psychic? No. like alan watts said \"you get out of life what you want\"\n\n\nI secretly want to destroy myself to destroy everything. To commit suicide when im 22. Thats why I haven't forgotten that memory thats why I can't imagine reaching my 23rd birthday.\nThats why this heart break is too much to bare because i don't think i am capable of changing.\nI want my girlfriend back but I dont want someone who doesn't love me. I don't know if I can or if i even should.\nI dont want the history we made to be just that history.\nI don't like how my life is worse than when i met her.\nI look at the situations I get into and i cant see this ending, so what if i meet another girl I'm going to get another \"whisper\" and subconsciously follow it to reality.\nI don't want this anymore and I have no clue what to do or at least I do know what to do but I don't think i can do it.\nThat fear is so strong now the fear of failure and the procrastination that comes with it. I feel chained to this fate i setup for myself.\n\n\nI feel like death is the only option and isn't it strange I no longer have any underlying finger, not something telling me to do it i have nothing. There is no whisper for the future everything is completely uncertain. But that makes it feel even more like the end. For my whole life i have listened to it and now its not here anymore.\ni hope to make it to my 23rd birthday I want to see what its like for something the \"whisper/feeling\"to not be true but thats in April and with the way things are I don't think I will.\n\nThe end\n\n*I hate the fact that the only reason my ex is currently talking to me is because she thinks I'm suicidal, I know none of her feelings are genuine, why do we talk more now than when we were together? I know as soon as she is ready to move on or thinks im secure she is going to leave.  \n\nI know I could find another person make new memories I could do much more in life, but at the end of the day if in 4/8/10/20/40 years I'm back in this position again. What is the point its going to hurt much more than it does now.  \n\nThats the thing about life it wouldn't be so bad if you could undo, redo. But i can't im only getting older and things are getting harder and harder. I feel this may be the last chance to make something of my life but ultimately I don't even know if i should take it. \n\nMaybe this is how it was always meant to be. like all the other people who committed suicide before me. \n\nCurrently I'm just working to give my mother as I forgive her for stealing the  money, I do love her and I want her to be financially secure when i'm gone. I think i'm going to live long enough to play the game of my dreams Monster Hunter World and then i'm going to commit suicide after I complete it.  Thats my current plan.* \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hlrf1", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I genuinely want help but I don't think its possible.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512433897.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hlrf1", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hlrf1/i_genuinely_want_help_but_i_dont_think_its/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512461999.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hlrf1/i_genuinely_want_help_but_i_dont_think_its/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Saaaand", "created_utc": 1512433199.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything that I do isnt worth it anymore.

old male. The only people I speak to on a regular basis are my parents. They\u2019re divorced and not happily. I\u2019ll talk more about the abuse, the divorce, and it\u2019s aftermath later. I am failing at life in every aspect. I\u2019m writing this on my phone overlooking a lake while I\u2019m supposed to be at class. I can\u2019t bring myself to go or even tell anybody where I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologize if you don\u2019t want to hear my life story  but I feel it\u2019s important to get a background on how I got to where I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know much about my parents life before I came along but I think they would have been better if they had never met. My parents began dating when they were young. My mother\u2019s father died in 1994 and I was conceived 1 month later; no doubt these two events are related. I don\u2019t know much about my early life but I do know my parents weren\u2019t together long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother and I lived with her grandparents The only memory I have of the great grandmother was of her funeral. I remember touching her waxy hand as she lay in her casket. She died in 1999. I grew up among an older generation so some of my most vivid memories are of their funerals. My great grandfather was the best man I ever met. He grew up in the depression, enlisted in the navy during the Korean War as a boiler man, and worked at Westinghouse as a boiler foreman on his return to the States. In the Navy and at Westinghouse he was exposed to asbestos. He developed mesothelioma. It was only discovered after he had a stroke while driving me home from school. The doctors don\u2019t know how he was able to keep the car on the road but I know he\u2019d never let anything happen to me. After a short but fierce battle with cancer he died in 2005. I was 9 years old and I lost my best friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later in 2005 I became interested in Catholicism after the death of Pope Saint John Paul II. My mother and I took RCIA classes and were baptized in 2006. I was a true believer and dedicated Catholic. I became an altar boy and served passion for several years. At that point in my life, I was 100% sure I was going to be a priest. I looked to my parish priest for support but I was always second place to an older boy who was also interested in becoming a priest. The priest organized a Tridentine Mass. it was very formal and traditional. It was rarely held and I asked my priest if I could serve in the mass and he said it would just be him and a deacon. I was disappointed but understood that traditionally altar boys were not allowed to serve High Mass. I nonetheless attended. As the procession began, guess who I saw leading it? The priest had chosen the other boy over me. I was devastated. We stopped regularly attending mass after that and I was no longer an altar boy. I learned several years ago that the boy did attend the seminary but was kicked out after he was arrested for drunk driving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this time, my mother and father married and moved in together. As far as I recall, things were fine for a while. But for reasons that I still don\u2019t know, they began to fight constantly. I tried to block out their yelling but the phrase I remember most often from my father was \u201cshut the fuck up or I\u2019ll knock your fucking teeth out.\u201d My mother insists that the fighting never got physical but I know that\u2019s a lie. Several times he kicked her out of the house.  Sometimes she would leave for the night. My father\u2019s name was on her car because she didn\u2019t have the credit to get a loan herself. He wouldn\u2019t let her take it. I was driving at this point and I\u2019d let her take my car. She kept a pillow and blanket in my truck. She said she went to a hotel but I know she slept in the car. Occasionally she was gone for longer; the longest period was nearly 6 months. She always came back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was always a good student. The lessons came easily to me and I didn\u2019t have to work hard. I think that\u2019s one of my problems, I never learned to work hard for anything because I didn\u2019t need to. I breezed through high school, never doing more work than I needed to. College was different. The plan in the beginning was for me to take core classes at the local community college and transfer to a university to study engineering. That didn\u2019t work out. 4 years of community college and $20,000 in student loan debt later, I still don\u2019t have a degree. Little problems became big ones. The first semester I studied Network Infrastructure, then I changed my major to Paramedic Science. Here I failed my first class ever. My medical terminology professor was a stone cold bitch. I stopped going tot he class half way through the semester. Anatomy and physiology was different. It was the hardest class I ever took. I squeezed by with at 71%. I had had my first taste of what it was like to have to work hard for something academic and I hated it. The next semester, at the pressuring of my father, I changed majors again to Homeland Security to become a firefighter. My dad always said it\u2019s the easiest job there is. \u201cGravy train\u201d is what he called it. It isn\u2019t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention that during this time my mother and father continued to fight. It ruined me as a person. I would fail at least one class a semester.  Not because the classes were hard but because I would become so depressed that I wouldn\u2019t go to class. I couldn\u2019t let my father know though, so I would park my car somewhere and think toxic thoughts. Sometimes I would just drive. I fantasized that I could just keep driving and never stop. Maybe I\u2019d find a town I liked and stay there. Right know I\u2019m parked in a spot overlooking a lake. The same kale my great grandfather had a boat. We spent a lot of time on this lake. But not anymore. I want to be with him again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In spring 2014, I failed all of my classes. My father doesn\u2019t know. This semester is going to be exactly the same. I couldn\u2019t get financial aid this semester because I had failed so many classes but I registered anyway. My mother, I love my mother, she knows that j failed last semester. She worked so hard to scrape up the money to send me to college this semester. She regularly worked 80-100 hours a week at a job she hates.  I have already been dropped for nonpayment. I told her I don&amp;#39;t have to pay for school yet but the semester is running out. She will know that something is wrong but I don\u2019t have to heart to tell her.

They\u2019re divorced and not happily. I\u2019ll talk more about the abuse, the divorce, and it\u2019s aftermath later. I am failing at life in every aspect. I\u2019m writing this on my phone overlooking a lake while I\u2019m supposed to be at class. I can\u2019t bring myself to go or even tell anybody where I am.\n\nI apologize if you don\u2019t want to hear my life story  but I feel it\u2019s important to get a background on how I got to where I am.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about my parents life before I came along but I think they would have been better if they had never met. My parents began dating when they were young. My mother\u2019s father died in 1994 and I was conceived 1 month later; no doubt these two events are related. I don\u2019t know much about my early life but I do know my parents weren\u2019t together long. \n\nMy mother and I lived with her grandparents The only memory I have of the great grandmother was of her funeral. I remember touching her waxy hand as she lay in her casket. She died in 1999. I grew up among an older generation so some of my most vivid memories are of their funerals. My great grandfather was the best man I ever met. He grew up in the depression, enlisted in the navy during the Korean War as a boiler man, and worked at Westinghouse as a boiler foreman on his return to the States. In the Navy and at Westinghouse he was exposed to asbestos. He developed mesothelioma. It was only discovered after he had a stroke while driving me home from school. The doctors don\u2019t know how he was able to keep the car on the road but I know he\u2019d never let anything happen to me. After a short but fierce battle with cancer he died in 2005. I was 9 years old and I lost my best friend. \n\nLater in 2005 I became interested in Catholicism after the death of Pope Saint John Paul II. My mother and I took RCIA classes and were baptized in 2006. I was a true believer and dedicated Catholic. I became an altar boy and served passion for several years. At that point in my life, I was 100% sure I was going to be a priest. I looked to my parish priest for support but I was always second place to an older boy who was also interested in becoming a priest. The priest organized a Tridentine Mass. it was very formal and traditional. It was rarely held and I asked my priest if I could serve in the mass and he said it would just be him and a deacon. I was disappointed but understood that traditionally altar boys were not allowed to serve High Mass. I nonetheless attended. As the procession began, guess who I saw leading it? The priest had chosen the other boy over me. I was devastated. We stopped regularly attending mass after that and I was no longer an altar boy. I learned several years ago that the boy did attend the seminary but was kicked out after he was arrested for drunk driving.\n\nDuring this time, my mother and father married and moved in together. As far as I recall, things were fine for a while. But for reasons that I still don\u2019t know, they began to fight constantly. I tried to block out their yelling but the phrase I remember most often from my father was \u201cshut the fuck up or I\u2019ll knock your fucking teeth out.\u201d My mother insists that the fighting never got physical but I know that\u2019s a lie. Several times he kicked her out of the house.  Sometimes she would leave for the night. My father\u2019s name was on her car because she didn\u2019t have the credit to get a loan herself. He wouldn\u2019t let her take it. I was driving at this point and I\u2019d let her take my car. She kept a pillow and blanket in my truck. She said she went to a hotel but I know she slept in the car. Occasionally she was gone for longer; the longest period was nearly 6 months. She always came back. \n\nI was always a good student. The lessons came easily to me and I didn\u2019t have to work hard. I think that\u2019s one of my problems, I never learned to work hard for anything because I didn\u2019t need to. I breezed through high school, never doing more work than I needed to. College was different. The plan in the beginning was for me to take core classes at the local community college and transfer to a university to study engineering. That didn\u2019t work out. 4 years of community college and $20,000 in student loan debt later, I still don\u2019t have a degree. Little problems became big ones. The first semester I studied Network Infrastructure, then I changed my major to Paramedic Science. Here I failed my first class ever. My medical terminology professor was a stone cold bitch. I stopped going tot he class half way through the semester. Anatomy and physiology was different. It was the hardest class I ever took. I squeezed by with at 71%. I had had my first taste of what it was like to have to work hard for something academic and I hated it. The next semester, at the pressuring of my father, I changed majors again to Homeland Security to become a firefighter. My dad always said it\u2019s the easiest job there is. \u201cGravy train\u201d is what he called it. It isn\u2019t. \n\nI forgot to mention that during this time my mother and father continued to fight. It ruined me as a person. I would fail at least one class a semester.  Not because the classes were hard but because I would become so depressed that I wouldn\u2019t go to class. I couldn\u2019t let my father know though, so I would park my car somewhere and think toxic thoughts. Sometimes I would just drive. I fantasized that I could just keep driving and never stop. Maybe I\u2019d find a town I liked and stay there. Right know I\u2019m parked in a spot overlooking a lake. The same kale my great grandfather had a boat. We spent a lot of time on this lake. But not anymore. I want to be with him again. \n\nIn spring 2014, I failed all of my classes. My father doesn\u2019t know. This semester is going to be exactly the same. I couldn\u2019t get financial aid this semester because I had failed so many classes but I registered anyway. My mother, I love my mother, she knows that j failed last semester. She worked so hard to scrape up the money to send me to college this semester. She regularly worked 80-100 hours a week at a job she hates.  I have already been dropped for nonpayment. I told her I don't have to pay for school yet but the semester is running out. She will know that something is wrong but I don\u2019t have to heart to tell her. She was the first person in her family to go to college. And she attended as a single mother. I have no job, no responsibilities, and I can\u2019t even finish community college. \n\nI really just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been sitting in my car looking at the lake and writing this for well over an hour. I know I should go home and tell her but I just don\u2019t know how.

She is the only thing keeping me alive and I think I\u2019m the only thing keeping her alive as well. \n\nI have written notes to my family, my school, the fire department I volunteer at but I don\u2019t know what to do  \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI have to go now.

Alright tonight is no different from any night, I find myself crying myself to sleep at 2:00 am every other night from my dread of going on through life more than I have. I get that I\u2019m young and have a lot to experience still but I don\u2019t find any particular joy for anything that a regular 16 year old would look forward to. I don\u2019t want to graduate, I dread everything, I don\u2019t want to move out, I love my mom to the point where its almost unhealthy, she\u2019s always been my only support even though she is pretty emotionally abusive, though I don\u2019t blame her because she too had a very rough upbringing. My family has a long history of mental illness and I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety &amp;amp; seemingly everything in between. I have the whole sob story of my parents divorce, an alcoholic deadbeat dad who has a whole other family that he cares about more. I raised in a Jehovah witness family until my mom got kicked out because of the divorce and now we\u2019ve both become agnostic. My grandmother is a schizophrenic now and I blame the cult of that religion, we don\u2019t have any family now, it\u2019s really just me and my mom. I\u2019ve had friends and some pretty close ones too, I\u2019m good at attracting the sad ones, but I\u2019ve never found them important and have always ended up cutting ties, I currently have no one and I honestly prefer it that way as everyone annoys me with their meaningless issues. I was sexually abused by cousins, uncles, my dads friends, you name it, just about every sob story you can imagine I guess, I promise I\u2019m not looking for pity. I take meds spastically here and there mostly because I can\u2019t remember to take them for the life of me, and maybe thats why I haven\u2019t felt a difference on them. For as long as I can remember I haven\u2019t enjoyed much or found meaning in anything, though my mom loves going out and having fun and I feel like thats the only time I enjoy anything, I fear about what will happen when she dies, or when my dogs die, I don\u2019t think I could handle it like I should, I feel like I would truly either go insane or end it completely, no matter who I have in life. I don\u2019t want kids, again I know Im young and everyone says my opinion will change but I just don\u2019t think i\u2019m fit to be a mother in my emotional state, I don\u2019t want to put my children through the pain of me being unstable. I can\u2019t hold relationships well either, It\u2019ll go good for months and then I lose interest or just don\u2019t put in much effort, I\u2019ve even cheated in the past, I sometimes feel bad about it but other times I don\u2019t, I\u2019ve thought about the possibility of being a sociopath or something like that, but I feel I have shreds of empathy still in me.  I think a lot about life after graduation, I know college is basically essential in most peoples eyes and knowing me I\u2019ll probably endure it and suffer because its expected and thats life I guess, I just don\u2019t see the point if I\u2019ll probably get a middle class job that will mean living paycheck to paycheck anyways. I don\u2019t want to work, I know no one does but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to hold a job, I dread growing up and anything related to it. I think that if I could choose any career, it\u2019d be involving writing, whether it be a book or my poetry, the only things I really think I\u2019m quite good at. I\u2019m actually a smart kid i guess, AP classes for everything, all A\u2019s, even really good at instruments, I play a lot, and sing too, I know I could be really successful if I wanted to, but I don\u2019t. I cry a lot because I just really don\u2019t want to live anymore, I\u2019ve had a bit of suicide attempts, more prominent when I was in the depths of anorexia, but I\u2019ve seen how much its hurt my mom I don\u2019t think I could. I just don\u2019t see myself as being valuable member of society, I\u2019ve always wanted to make a change or difference but Im either too lazy to or just don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t really even care about the world much anymore.   I sometimes feel like I\u2019m faking it all, I\u2019m good at that, I think I\u2019m a chronic liar because I\u2019ve lied a lot about who I am to people, but I just cant help but feel so unmotivated for just about anything. I don\u2019t want to disappoint my mom though, so I keep going. Every morning I cry from just how bad I don\u2019t want to go to school, I think it\u2019d be easier if I were homeschooled and I\u2019ve begged my mom but she thinks social skills are important, I don\u2019t think she realizes the extent of my social anxiety, also money is tight and I just don\u2019t want to be a bother, I don\u2019t even really care about being anyone anyways.   Every day is the same, when I\u2019ve done all my homework and chores I sleep into the next day unless my mom has time to hang out with me, she does so much for me, even moved to a different state because of my seasonal depression and how much I love the cold (she can\u2019t stand it and gets sick so often in it) to see if I\u2019d feel better, I feel like the worst person in the world.  I don\u2019t really know where this is going so I think I\u2019ll end it here, it feels better to write it down, but it\u2019s crazy to read just how bad my life sounds, I know others have it much worse but believe me I don\u2019t really think what I\u2019ve gone through affects me on the daily, or even at all, though obviously my therapists say otherwise. I just want to know if it\u2019s normal for a depressed person to have these thoughts or feelings, I have depersonalization and I feel like I\u2019m on autopilot most the time. When receiving advice I almost get offended, because I feel like I\u2019ve tried everything and when people suggest that I just try to be happy it\u2019s insulting to think people just assume I haven\u2019t tried to be better. A part of me thinks I don\u2019t want to be not depressed, like it\u2019s a valuable part of me I can\u2019t risk losing, like it makes me interesting somehow. I have school at 6 am tomorrow. I think about dropping out, it\u2019s so hard to get out of bed.   Do I maybe have something else I don\u2019t know about? Thank you for your time.  TL;DR: I have the typical pity party of a life and I really just don\u2019t want to live but can\u2019t end it, I don\u2019t have feelings but I also feel everything at once, I don\u2019t feel real.

I just needed someone to tell me it'll be okay but she just got mad at me and made me feel so much worse.\n\nShe has a bunch of her own problems, depression, suicide attempts self harmed etc. She cut herself for the first time in years this week, I told her that if she ever wants to cut again to text me or call me and I'll be there for her. But she just started laughing because it was ironic.\n\nI just really want to die, even more then I did last night. She's gone to sleep now but I don't know what to do, she's the only person I tell my feelings to. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense I just want to talk to someone, thanks     ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hev7l", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Tried killing myself for the 5th time, girlfriend mad at me", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hev7l", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hev7l/tried_killing_myself_for_the_5th_time_girlfriend/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512388985.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hev7l/tried_killing_myself_for_the_5th_time_girlfriend/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "throwaway0241392", "created_utc": 1512360185.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is just upsetting.

Over the past while at work I&amp;#39;ve been stealing time (putting down hours as though I worked them when I really didn&amp;#39;t). I&amp;#39;ve probably stolen quite a bit of it, especially recently. I&amp;#39;ve been in the office but I&amp;#39;ve been redditing instead of working. I feel incredibly guilty about it but I&amp;#39;ve been feeling extremely down recently for completely unrelated reasons which makes it impossible for me to focus long enough to get any work done (and following politics doesn&amp;#39;t help). I never feel rested or happy any more and haven&amp;#39;t for at least a year at this point. I didn&amp;#39;t even realize I&amp;#39;d been stealing so much time to the point I was barely working or that it is really a bad thing to do until recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that on Friday I overheard a conversation between two people who are essentially my boss and their boss. They were speaking in one of their offices with the door open, such that I could overhear only part of what they said. (I wasn&amp;#39;t eavesdropping, they were doing it right near where I &amp;quot;work&amp;quot;). They mentioned something about two years (I&amp;#39;m the only employee that&amp;#39;s been there two years) and something about $1000. The very end of the conversation was one of them not wanting to say/do something and the other encouraging them to &amp;quot;just say&amp;quot; something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been having paranoia over someone figuring out that I&amp;#39;ve been stealing time, and this made me go a bit nuts. I decided to grab a quick drink of water after a few minutes, and when I did the reticent boss was there. We made some pleasant small talk and he seemed normal and then he left the little break area, as he did so he said, under his breath, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to do this&amp;quot;. That is very out of character for him and has really gotten to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All weekend I&amp;#39;ve been both racked with guilt over having stolen time in the first place and I debating over if this means they know now, and that it&amp;#39;ll permafuck my life to the point where I might as well not even bother living (not that I haven&amp;#39;t already considered just ending the guilt trip over stealing time and being in a shitty place in life in the first place). I&amp;#39;d never be able to explain a 2 year gap in my CV and I don&amp;#39;t see myself getting hired anywhere with an old job that says I stole time on my record. Hell, I&amp;#39;ve probably stolen enough time by this point that they could get the police involved. The company gets federal money so I&amp;#39;m probably be beyond fucked over this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to face going into work Monday, and I keep thinking it&amp;#39;d just be easier to skip work and end it all. If I could I&amp;#39;d just give back all the money, confess to everything and leave, but that&amp;#39;d mean burning the reference and making myself truly unemployable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the record, I&amp;#39;ve thought about killing myself before this, but now I have this feeling I&amp;#39;ll drive up to work, sit in the parking lot and blow out my brains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sound less like &amp;quot;oh you reddited instead of working, and now you&amp;#39;re getting your just deserts&amp;quot;, I hate that I reddit, I really do. I do it because I always feel bad, then I feel bad that I&amp;#39;m on reddit so I stay on reddit to try and feel better. It is why I&amp;#39;m so abusive at times on my other account, because I feel bad about myself and my life. I basically fucked up everything and I&amp;#39;m a virgin with only one failed relationship.

Over the past while at work I've been stealing time (putting down hours as though I worked them when I really didn't). I've probably stolen quite a bit of it, especially recently. I've been in the office but I've been redditing instead of working. I feel incredibly guilty about it but I've been feeling extremely down recently for completely unrelated reasons which makes it impossible for me to focus long enough to get any work done (and following politics doesn't help). I never feel rested or happy any more and haven't for at least a year at this point. I didn't even realize I'd been stealing so much time to the point I was barely working or that it is really a bad thing to do until recently.\n\nThe problem is that on Friday I overheard a conversation between two people who are essentially my boss and their boss. They were speaking in one of their offices with the door open, such that I could overhear only part of what they said. (I wasn't eavesdropping, they were doing it right near where I \"work\"). They mentioned something about two years (I'm the only employee that's been there two years) and something about $1000. The very end of the conversation was one of them not wanting to say/do something and the other encouraging them to \"just say\" something else.\n\nI've been having paranoia over someone figuring out that I've been stealing time, and this made me go a bit nuts. I decided to grab a quick drink of water after a few minutes, and when I did the reticent boss was there. We made some pleasant small talk and he seemed normal and then he left the little break area, as he did so he said, under his breath, \"I don't want to do this\". That is very out of character for him and has really gotten to me.\n\nAll weekend I've been both racked with guilt over having stolen time in the first place and I debating over if this means they know now, and that it'll permafuck my life to the point where I might as well not even bother living (not that I haven't already considered just ending the guilt trip over stealing time and being in a shitty place in life in the first place). I'd never be able to explain a 2 year gap in my CV and I don't see myself getting hired anywhere with an old job that says I stole time on my record. Hell, I've probably stolen enough time by this point that they could get the police involved. The company gets federal money so I'm probably be beyond fucked over this.\n\nI don't know how to face going into work Monday, and I keep thinking it'd just be easier to skip work and end it all. If I could I'd just give back all the money, confess to everything and leave, but that'd mean burning the reference and making myself truly unemployable.\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor the record, I've thought about killing myself before this, but now I have this feeling I'll drive up to work, sit in the parking lot and blow out my brains.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nTo sound less like \"oh you reddited instead of working, and now you're getting your just deserts\", I hate that I reddit, I really do. I do it because I always feel bad, then I feel bad that I'm on reddit so I stay on reddit to try and feel better. It is why I'm so abusive at times on my other account, because I feel bad about myself and my life. I basically fucked up everything and I'm a virgin with only one failed relationship. I really, truly, hate myself at this point, it seems like nothing I do ever works out any more.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nI guess this means I can't even write a fucking reddit post correctly.

You have so much to live for.\"\n\nI wish I cut down every psychiatrist and doctor right there in the hospital each time I was admitted, or told a magical bottle of capsules with the same chemicals you find in batteries would \"fix me.\"\n\nAnd if anyone dares to 'encourage', or reassure me that 'it gets better', I only fester and brim with more unbareable resentment, disgust and despair. I am tired of being lied to, and I have grown far too tired to lie to myself any further that there is any thing worth living for, because there is not.\n\nOur time fleets. And you can wait, all of you fucking sheep, and enjoy in your minute blisses and distractions. And continue to live in this deceit, to breathe and partake in it each day, but to be a slave, an automaton? To live simply to live when there is no benefit to do so? \n\nBy Friday I shall rest eternally. And it will be the final and only moment of my twenty-five years of living on this green and blue sphere [of] purgatory and shit that I will be joyous for.\n\nAnd I won't look back.\n\nI can't wait to leave this all behind, to be free from it all. \n\nFor the black to fill my eyes,\n\n\nAnd feel the cold, bony hand of the Reaper take my own into his, and guide me to nothingness. Into death.\n\nI have lived. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hf8hf", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "The End.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512364902.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hf8hf", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hf8hf/the_end/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512393232.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hf8hf/the_end/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "vaccine_b", "created_utc": 1512364432.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s past midnight, which means it&amp;#39;s my birthday and I&amp;#39;m very tempted to make it my deathday.

I don't care about anyone else, not even myself, if she asked me to kill myself for her I might just do it. \n\nThough to be honest I might as well now, would at least help me to get sleep for once. Pain isn't an issue with the ridiculous amount of opioid painkillers I've got, I'd be a potato in minutes, the drawback of killing myself is how my mum and dad would feel.\n\nI don't talk to my parents about things. I used to talk to my girlfriends mum. I want to. But  I can't. She blocked me. The problem that is me went away for her. Why can't I block myself? Can i block life? I'm going to die one day anyway, why not now? \n\nI don't think I could commit suicide, but if i could prevent my own murder I definitely would not. Although being blackout drunk might facilitate tramadol for dinner.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7he48d", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I have a good, prosperous, and promising life.

(10 years) \nA physically abusive one. (2 years) \nOne that I felt actually gave a damn about me and then told me to GTFO one day. (1 year, friends much longer)\nAnd just recently another great guy who couldn&amp;#39;t look past my insecurities from my older relationships. (6 months or so)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 29 year old gay guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These relationships have all naturally impacted me in a lot of different ways, but a common theme is pain and a strong lack of closure. With the last two in particular, I thought everything was going fine, and then one day a conversation would come up that they felt they couldn&amp;#39;t be with me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fighter and a strong communicator. I&amp;#39;ve learnt to ask for transparency in my relationships. If there&amp;#39;s a problem, let&amp;#39;s work together to fix it, and be stronger for it. In these last two relationships (both of which were considerably happier than my first two) the end came completely out of nowhere and neither of them seemed to want to try and work things out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my last boyfriend broke up with me because he felt as though I didn&amp;#39;t trust him. A lack of trust has been a common theme in my first two relationships - I have been cheated on and also caught them on apps like Grindr or Tinder. I tried to make this super clear when my last two relationships started that I have baggage, but I would do whatever I could to move past it. I wasn&amp;#39;t neurotically distrustful and I would repeatedly say that while some things made me uneasy, it was my last intention to to make them feel like I was dictating what they could and couldn&amp;#39;t do with their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for whatever reason, my promises to try harder weren&amp;#39;t good enough. I&amp;#39;m in group therapy at the hospital once a week and was seeing a psychiatrist once a week for six months after the end of my third relationship. I&amp;#39;m still in the group therapy. I&amp;#39;m medicated. This is me trying to get better and be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it wasn&amp;#39;t enough. My last boyfriend ended it. I went over with his things, we hugged and kissed in the rain, and told each other we loved each other and wished each other well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then for some reason while I was on the bus home, I decided that I didn&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore. I was tired of not being good enough for people. I was tired of putting so much of myself into these guys I had brought into my life. I had felt suicidal before, but I had never gone through with anything, but as soon as I got off that bus and was stomping home in the rain, I had every intention of ending my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really kind-of a blur now. I took out my journal, which had a lot of comments about my last relationship in it, and a series of letters I had written when I felt suicidal the year before. I wrote my banking pin on the whiteboard of my fridge. I sat down on the edge of my bed and just kept swallowing [medication 1] tablets. I probably took about 20-25 of them, and I worried that if I took more, I might puke them all up. In hindsight, I should have probably taken my [medication 2] tablets as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I remember just crawling into my bed and going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except I woke up like 12 months* later in the middle of the night. My depth perception was fucked. I could barely turn my phone on. I couldn&amp;#39;t enter the password right on my laptop. I felt nauseous so I didn&amp;#39;t know if taking more pills would work or not so I ended up just rolling on my living room floor just being miserable about my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the next day, for whatever reason, I told my ex that I had done it. I hadn&amp;#39;t intended it to sound manipulative or like a guilt trip. I was just super transparent. I said that I didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with these things anymore. He asked me where I was so he could come over, but he also called the police and the police came first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with the police. I played it off as having a rough week and I was just going to go for a walk, come home, make tea, and go to sleep, but they basically implied that if I bolted, they would have to chase me down as per some mental health law in Canada. They just asked me nicely to voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 2 hours in the hospital, I went to my ex&amp;#39;s place, and he was not excited to see me. I couldn&amp;#39;t/can&amp;#39;t tell if it&amp;#39;s because he felt like I was using the suicide to somehow manipulate him back into the relationship or if he was mad because he was afraid of losing me. Maybe both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He won&amp;#39;t talk to me now, and I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;ll ever want to talk to me again. I&amp;#39;m not close with my family (they are not big fans of the gays) and I don&amp;#39;t want to worry my friends and be that &amp;quot;one friend&amp;quot; that tried to kill himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do now. I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do next. I don&amp;#39;t really know how I should be moving on, or if I should be taking time off of work to just let the sand settle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Help?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "To make a long story as short as I can, I've been through four relationships my entire life. \n\nAn emotionally abusive one.

I've learnt to ask for transparency in my relationships. If there's a problem, let's work together to fix it, and be stronger for it. In these last two relationships (both of which were considerably happier than my first two) the end came completely out of nowhere and neither of them seemed to want to try and work things out.\n\nSo my last boyfriend broke up with me because he felt as though I didn't trust him. A lack of trust has been a common theme in my first two relationships - I have been cheated on and also caught them on apps like Grindr or Tinder. I tried to make this super clear when my last two relationships started that I have baggage, but I would do whatever I could to move past it. I wasn't neurotically distrustful and I would repeatedly say that while some things made me uneasy, it was my last intention to to make them feel like I was dictating what they could and couldn't do with their time.\n\nAnd for whatever reason, my promises to try harder weren't good enough. I'm in group therapy at the hospital once a week and was seeing a psychiatrist once a week for six months after the end of my third relationship. I'm still in the group therapy. I'm medicated. This is me trying to get better and be stronger.\n\nAnd it wasn't enough. My last boyfriend ended it. I went over with his things, we hugged and kissed in the rain, and told each other we loved each other and wished each other well.\n\nAnd then for some reason while I was on the bus home, I decided that I didn't want to do this anymore. I was tired of not being good enough for people. I was tired of putting so much of myself into these guys I had brought into my life. I had felt suicidal before, but I had never gone through with anything, but as soon as I got off that bus and was stomping home in the rain, I had every intention of ending my life.\n\nIt's really kind-of a blur now. I took out my journal, which had a lot of comments about my last relationship in it, and a series of letters I had written when I felt suicidal the year before. I wrote my banking pin on the whiteboard of my fridge. I sat down on the edge of my bed and just kept swallowing [medication 1] tablets. I probably took about 20-25 of them, and I worried that if I took more, I might puke them all up. In hindsight, I should have probably taken my [medication 2] tablets as well. \n\nAnd then I remember just crawling into my bed and going to sleep. \n\nExcept I woke up like 12 months* later in the middle of the night. My depth perception was fucked. I could barely turn my phone on. I couldn't enter the password right on my laptop. I felt nauseous so I didn't know if taking more pills would work or not so I ended up just rolling on my living room floor just being miserable about my life.\n\nAnd the next day, for whatever reason, I told my ex that I had done it. I hadn't intended it to sound manipulative or like a guilt trip. I was just super transparent. I said that I didn't want to deal with these things anymore. He asked me where I was so he could come over, but he also called the police and the police came first.\n\nI didn't want to deal with the police. I played it off as having a rough week and I was just going to go for a walk, come home, make tea, and go to sleep, but they basically implied that if I bolted, they would have to chase me down as per some mental health law in Canada. They just asked me nicely to voluntarily.\n\nAfter 2 hours in the hospital, I went to my ex's place, and he was not excited to see me. I couldn't/can't tell if it's because he felt like I was using the suicide to somehow manipulate him back into the relationship or if he was mad because he was afraid of losing me. Maybe both.\n\nHe won't talk to me now, and I don't know if he'll ever want to talk to me again. I'm not close with my family (they are not big fans of the gays) and I don't want to worry my friends and be that \"one friend\" that tried to kill himself.\n\nI don't really know what to do now. I don't really know what to do next. I don't really know how I should be moving on, or if I should be taking time off of work to just let the sand settle. \n\nHelp?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hd0k5", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "So I tried to kill myself...", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512349925.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hd0k5", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hd0k5/so_i_tried_to_kill_myself/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512369910.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7hd0k5/so_i_tried_to_kill_myself/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "awkward_mess", "created_utc": 1512341110.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hd0da", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "It feels like the last week of my life, we're just waiting now.

I don&amp;#39;t do drugs, but I\u00a0smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My\u00a0Mental HELL began\u00a03 months ago.(22.07.2017 I DON&amp;#39;T GET IT HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN ONE DAY) I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone(Chester From Linkin Park) who died by\u00a0suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suddenly asked myself:\u00a0&amp;quot;Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?&amp;quot; and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don&amp;#39;t go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head:(As I said, I can&amp;#39;t trully describe them.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird feeling: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird feeling:  I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird random feeling: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feels like I won&amp;#39;t be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0When I try to do something I can&amp;#39;t do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can&amp;#39;t fully describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like I don&amp;#39;t want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can&amp;#39;t describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0This is about babies. Somewhere I have read &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want kids on this terrible world.&amp;quot; And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Everything seems darker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird feeling: When I read here on reddit someone who is suicidal/depressed etc. All of the feelings come back and it feels like i am feeling the same way as him. (When time passes I can see the difference.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AND THE MOST IMPORTANT&lt;/em&gt; :&lt;strong&gt;WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had (? I am not sure what i felt -???Anxiety attack??? )and the thoughts felt so real like I am feeling the same way, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a psychiatrist, and told him about the throughts. He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much symptoms of depression.\nBut I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can&amp;#39;t tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don&amp;#39;t. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don&amp;#39;t get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF?\nAlso when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can&amp;#39;t ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don&amp;#39;t want to get better makes me more terrified.

I don't do drugs, but I\u00a0smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.\n\nMy\u00a0Mental HELL began\u00a03 months ago.(22.07.2017 I DON'T GET IT HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN ONE DAY) I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone(Chester From Linkin Park) who died by\u00a0suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.\n\nI don't know why.\n\nI don't know how.\n\nI don't know what to do next.\n\nI suddenly asked myself:\u00a0\"Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?\" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.\n\n\nI have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.\n\nMy interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head:(As I said, I can't trully describe them.)\n\nWeird feeling: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?\n\nWeird feeling:  I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed? \n\nweird random feeling: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feels like I won't be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0This is about babies. Somewhere I have read \"I don't want kids on this terrible world.\" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Everything seems darker.\n\nWeird feeling: When I read here on reddit someone who is suicidal/depressed etc. All of the feelings come back and it feels like i am feeling the same way as him. (When time passes I can see the difference.)\n\n*AND THE MOST IMPORTANT* :**WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......**\n\nYesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had (? I am not sure what i felt -???Anxiety attack??? )and the thoughts felt so real like I am feeling the same way, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.\n\nI went to a psychiatrist, and told him about the throughts. He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.\n\nI don't have much symptoms of depression.\nBut I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can't tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don't. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don't get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??\n\nI don't wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF?\nAlso when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can't ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don't want to get better makes me more terrified. Does that sound like Active SI?\n\nAnd many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.\n\nI visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,\u00a0no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.\n\nEverytime i post on reddit i feel like i missed something....\n\nDo I sound suicidal?\n\nThanks in advance,\u00a0have a good night.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7h95de", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Does this sound like Suicide Ideation/Sucidality?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 14, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7h95de", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7h95de/does_this_sound_like_suicide_ideationsucidality/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512328397.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7h95de/does_this_sound_like_suicide_ideationsucidality/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "lostminddd", "created_utc": 1512299597.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost everything in my life in less than a month.

That&amp;#39;s how you get yourself in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said... it comes more and more frequently now. I&amp;#39;ve been going through a divorce with the woman who I believed was my world, my everything - and to hear her tell it, I&amp;#39;m responsible for everything falling apart. In fairness I&amp;#39;ll take responsibility for a good 90% of it, and I wish I&amp;#39;d have realized how unhappy she was before it ever got here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I had to bury my daughter. Technically stillborn, but I held her in my arms and wept while there was a flatline tone going in the next room, and that helped kickstart the depression back up, as well as the PTSD. Fortunately, they didn&amp;#39;t commit me for that, so I could still get my hands on a weapon if I wanted to. It&amp;#39;s still up in the air whether that&amp;#39;s a good thing - hence why I&amp;#39;m here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They say the holidays are the worst, and I think that&amp;#39;s probably true. Maybe this&amp;#39;ll ease off in time - but I&amp;#39;ve gone to all sorts of different doctors, tried different medications, gone to therapy and groups and meetings, and none of it seems to make any difference. If anything - you know how there&amp;#39;s that point where you&amp;#39;re so depressed that you&amp;#39;d do something, but it&amp;#39;s so bad that you don&amp;#39;t have any initiative or energy to do it? Maybe the meds help - and then I start getting enough energy to really consider doing something, and then stop it before things go too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I sit here writing this, I look at my 2 year old daughter, and I think about my 10 yr old son, both of whom keep asking me why I&amp;#39;m so sad.

That's how you get yourself in trouble.\n\nThat said... it comes more and more frequently now. I've been going through a divorce with the woman who I believed was my world, my everything - and to hear her tell it, I'm responsible for everything falling apart. In fairness I'll take responsibility for a good 90% of it, and I wish I'd have realized how unhappy she was before it ever got here.\n\nA few years ago, I had to bury my daughter. Technically stillborn, but I held her in my arms and wept while there was a flatline tone going in the next room, and that helped kickstart the depression back up, as well as the PTSD. Fortunately, they didn't commit me for that, so I could still get my hands on a weapon if I wanted to. It's still up in the air whether that's a good thing - hence why I'm here.\n\nThey say the holidays are the worst, and I think that's probably true. Maybe this'll ease off in time - but I've gone to all sorts of different doctors, tried different medications, gone to therapy and groups and meetings, and none of it seems to make any difference. If anything - you know how there's that point where you're so depressed that you'd do something, but it's so bad that you don't have any initiative or energy to do it? Maybe the meds help - and then I start getting enough energy to really consider doing something, and then stop it before things go too far.\n\nAs I sit here writing this, I look at my 2 year old daughter, and I think about my 10 yr old son, both of whom keep asking me why I'm so sad.

My dad was a loser that never grew up. \nI was never wanted by either parent so I became my grandparents burden. When I became to much for them i was passed around family members from my aunt, my mom, and all of my other grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I was never wanted. I was a pretty quiet kid that kept to myself most of the time. I never really had friends growing up because I moved between family members and went to so many schools that I avoided getting close to people. \nMy high school years I lived with my dad&amp;#39;s grandparents. I was closest to them, grandpa Terry was the nicest man I&amp;#39;ve ever met and grandma Polly was a manipulative bitch but I think they loved me, or atleast pretended to better than anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really suicidal throughout high school and middle school, I told myself I&amp;#39;d wait till I graduated before I ended my life but my sophomore  year my grandpa got colon cancer and suffered a year and a half before passing. I didn&amp;#39;t want to burden my family with another loss so I postponed my inevitable demise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then my Dad was paralyzed from the neck down in an ATV accident and passed four days later. My dad was my grandma&amp;#39;s pride and joy and spoiled him rotten. My grandma was in poor health from smoking her entire life and was really struggling with the lose of her husband and son so I told myself I&amp;#39;d stay around for her until she passed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew her death was going to be hard on my aunt and with such a small family my aunt could really use the help with her until she passed. My grandma had COPD and emphysema and the doctors told her she wouldn&amp;#39;t make it long after losing my dad. She made it 3 and a half years after losing my dad, but that last year was absolute hell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that last year she weighed 80lbs for a long time. She was having trouble with her mind because of lack of oxygen and that last 6months became so bad that I ended up having to quit my fulltime job so I could stay with her all day. My aunt has 3 kids and helped out as much as she could. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking care of my grandma was the hardest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever done in my life. She would say the most terrible things to me and she would become violent. I had to sleep with a baby monitor in my room so I could keep an eye on her at night. Every night I would fall asleep to the sound of her rattling gasps for air. It&amp;#39;s a sound that will forever haunt me. Laying in bed at night to this day I can still hear it. I often thought about suffocating her and how I would be doing my aunt and little cousins a favor by doing so. Honestly, I think I&amp;#39;d be happier in prison than out here in the free world but never could bring myself to do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She would pass out in her chair at night and I would have to carry her to bed. She would have accidents and I would have to help her put on diapers and put her clothes on. Hospice stopped by 3 times a week to check in on her and give her different medications and once a week give her a bath but they truly were no help with her aggression or her needs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 5&amp;#39;2&amp;quot; female, 23, tatted up, and came out as gay about a year before her passing. She would never say hurtful things about my sexual orientation  (which I&amp;#39;m thankful) but she frequently would harass me on my looks, that I had no friends, that no one would love me, that no one in my family loved me and when I would tell her I was struggling with my mental health would encourage me to kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had to put alarms on all the doors after she escaped when I left her alone for 15 minutes. She wandered to the neighbors house and my aunt and I were frantically running down the streets to find her until we had to call the police. The neighbor across the street came out when the police arrived and said they had her and that she was telling them she feared for her safety because of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I brought her wheel chair and oxygen and careful wheeled her home and the whole time she&amp;#39;s insulting me threatening that I was finally going to jail. It was one of the most embrassing and humiliating things I&amp;#39;ve ever went through. Especially since at the time one of my neighbors was also my coworker and I still was at my fulltime job then. Luckily they were very empathetic and of course I didn&amp;#39;t get in any trouble with the law. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle balancing taking care of her and that fulltime job so I had a mental break down and quit in the middle of my shift. My coworkers knew that I was taking care of my grandma but didn&amp;#39;t really know how hard it was for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last few months of taking care of my grandma I met a really wonderful girl named Bailey and we started dating. She would stay at my house pretty often while I took care of my grandma and would hear through the baby monitor the terrible things she was saying. She pretending not to, and would even lie to me and say she wasn&amp;#39;t listening but I know she was. She met me when I thought I was the most broken I&amp;#39;ve ever been. She was like a ray of sunshine in my life and actually for once made me feel happy even in all this darkness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My lifesavings is pretty much gone from being unemployed for so long taking care of my grandma. I didn&amp;#39;t cry a single tear, honestly I&amp;#39;ve never been so relieved when she passed in September. It makes me  scared and sad that I feel so numb when it comes to losing her. That last year made it really hard to feel any sort of love when it came to her. In my eyes she died a year ago and I was just in charge of taking care of this angry shell of a woman I used to love. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After she passed I moved in with my aunt, uncle and their 3 kids. I sleep in the 9 year olds bedroom. She still sleeps with her parents and so does their 11 year old son but that&amp;#39;s another story. I&amp;#39;ve been here since the beginning of October because I was struggling to find work and I needed to get clean from smoking weed to be able to find work. I smoked weed a long time after losing my father but that too is another story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first month I had such terrible nightmares every night. I would wake up bawling, I was scared to go to sleep i was convinced my grandma was haunting me. The nightmares aren&amp;#39;t as frequent now, but the depression and scars of her memory are still here. My girlfriend and I are still together and we try to see eachother every weekend or so and i have some important job interviews in a few days so things should be looking up.....but they aren&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The depression is even worse. I&amp;#39;m having even more dark thoughts than before and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking more and more about that promise i made myself so many years ago. My grandpa&amp;#39;s dead, my dad, my grandma and I&amp;#39;ve run out of excuses to stay alive. \nThe only thing keeping me alive is the guilt. I don&amp;#39;t want my mom and my aunt to have to pay for a cremation. I don&amp;#39;t want them to find my body and I don&amp;#39;t want my girlfriend to feel like she didn&amp;#39;t do enough to help me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of us are just dealt shitty cards, and can&amp;#39;t keep bluffing anymore. I&amp;#39;m struggling to lie to people and tell them I&amp;#39;m okay or that I&amp;#39;m doing fine. As much as I joke about killing myself you&amp;#39;d think my family knew.\nToday I cracked and confessed to my girlfriend that if I don&amp;#39;t get this job Tuesday that I&amp;#39;m going to lose all hope. That I feel like I&amp;#39;ve fallen into a pit of despair and I don&amp;#39;t think I can climb out this time. I&amp;#39;m not sure I want to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me hopes that i don&amp;#39;t get this job on Tuesday. I want that final push. I really don&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore. I need help, not to save me but I need someone to take me for a drive. I don&amp;#39;t want to leave my car. I want to make sure my little sister gets that for her 16th birthday. I want to make sure my cat is going to be okay and I want to make sure nobody finds my body till I&amp;#39;m just a bag of bones. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;#39;m going to drive up to Green Peter and find a spot. I think the 2nd bridge is far enough up that no one will find me. If the fall doesn&amp;#39;t get me the cold water will or the swiftness of the river. I&amp;#39;m just going to go up there and sit there for awhile and write some important letters I&amp;#39;ve been putting off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know why I wrote this. I guess because it&amp;#39;s 2am and I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone else to talk to and I can&amp;#39;t sleep anymore. I haven&amp;#39;t been able to sleep for a long time now. I&amp;#39;m ready for a long rest. Fuck my soul, but God if there is a God please have mercy on my family and on Bailey.

I love waking up on Tuesdays/Thursday just because I know I have someone to talk to for 30 minutes at least. My mind is so out of whack I have to talk to myself just to realize what I am doing, and even if I do have a plan I never get it done. Coupled with thoughts of mom always dying it never gets better. I live around 3 hours from home. My mom will say she is coming up to see me and she might take longer and I can never get the thought of her dying or something bad happening to her on the drive up here. I don&amp;#39;t have a license so it&amp;#39;s hard for me to do anything up here unless I walk, which isn&amp;#39;t really a problem for me. My love life is so non-existent. I have never talked to a girl about dating. Sure I talk to a lot of guys and girls everyday and have great conversations, just none of them hit off.  I don&amp;#39;t think I am that ugly, but having low-self-esteem always kills my vibe. One thing that happened that hasn&amp;#39;t bothered me was I was in a frat and one of the active guys lied and said I was disrespecting girls in public which wouldn&amp;#39;t happen since I barely talk in public. And my sister&amp;#39;s boyfriend who is another frat talked to the president and they said everyone liked me besides that guy pretty much just their rule was one and you are gone. Those were like my only &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, but now I have no one. I sit in my room all day again. Finals coming up, and I really don&amp;#39;t care about them since I am changing my major, but I may not even get to that next semester I may actually be gone. Looking back at where I came from, all my friends back home are doing nothing. Still smoking weed all day doing nothing with their lives. At least some of them are trying next semester going to WV for culinary school. I can never stop caring about their futures, and who they will be when times come. They are my real brothers so I doubt we will ever be broken apart even if I barely see them nowadays.

I loved her and im pretty sure she loved me for most of it. Im 19 now and she was the first girlfriend ive had. She couldnt count how many guys she had been with if she had four hands but I didnt care, I really liked her. My friends and pretty much everyone i knew judged her and myself when we started dating (back in senior year of high school right) but i didnt care. I usually would but to me she was more important than all of them. We were both jealous but she only had guy friends, but i didnt mind that, i trusted her. Over the course of 2 years we were seeing eachother all the time, i had stopped seeing all my other friends, stopped doing sports and working out, cancelled any plans so i could spend time with her. She also pretty much made me get rid of any girl Friend i would rarely talk to. But she would consistently go out with her guy friends (forgot to mention she gets REALLLLL close when shes a little tipsy)  At this point she wanted me to stop smoking marijuana. I believe she really just wanted to help me but she wasnt very supportive about it. She ended up seeing her ex (who is ironically a drug dealer) after i had tried a few times but ended up smoking and lying, which i shouldnt have lied,  and i didnt know what to do. Time passes, we end up getting back together and of course by this time our relationship isnt the same as it was the first months we met. She didnt like that although i was not the best boyfriend during this whole time, a lot of accumulation of little things (and big) that i totally understand was not cool.\nMy best friend and I start seeing each other more and my ex would throw small parties at her place and we&amp;#39;d all be there. They became really close (a lot more than i found appropriate ex.. she had sit on his lap like she would sit on me which i found really disturbing, and the worst part, I SAID NOTHING!) So i have family in the US that i hadnt seen in a while and i end up taking a week off to go visit them. I tell my 2 friends and they start talking about how theyre going to get together like that whole week and go to festivals and have fun (which she never really proposed to me). This kinda bothered me the way theyd talk about it but i said nothing and didnt think about it. The day before i leave my ex and i were both working and i asked her if she wanted to see me. She said she had plans, i ask her whats up she says shes going to drink with my best buddy. I find it a little weird how they hadnt said anything to me and i jokingly ask what time were leaving and she really sent off this vibe that she didnt want me coming but acted as if it was okay. We all drink have a good time, i leave the next day.\nThe first 2-1/2 days she didnt talk to me so i end up messaging her, blablabla shes seeing my buddy, theyre going to drink, ok. The next day i get a text from my buddy saying how they fell asleep together (only sleep) and how he feels really bad blablabla, i flip and dont talk to my ex for the rest of the trip (took her a while to even message me that day). I get back and simply put we end up getting together again,i pretty much dumped my best friend but she keeps talking to him... A few weeks pass and i check her phone while shes asleep and i find out she had been fucking sleeping with him while we were &amp;#39;&amp;#39;together&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and that first time too. I flip the fuck out, and long story short i end up sleeping with another girl in the span of a week. I regret everything. I knew that i still loved her and i could have said no but i didnt. And i hate myself everyday for that. Now shes seeing my buddy again and i feel like shes manipulating me with this messages bbut than she&amp;#39;ll send me some video and expects a nice reply.. idk Im to a point where i wake up in the morning and dont want to get up. I dont want to do anything because i feel like its all useless. And when i say that i am 100% convinced that everything is useless and i dont know why im doing anything really.. if that makes sense ahah\nI smoke more than ever now and i cant remember the last day ive gone sober.

I feel this pain in my chest that just keeps growing like a stubborn weed pushing itself through concrete. \n\nI want to be happy, I don\u2019t like being sad. I can\u2019t help it. \n\nI think of all the people that will die. I think of all my close friends and family members dying one day. Having to bury every single one and not being able to take it. Every death chisels a piece of my broken wall. Tearing it down piece by piece until I disappear and become an empty shell. \n\nI need help\n\nI can\u2019t get help because only crazy people get help and I\u2019m not crazy. I don\u2019t need someone to tell me how to live my life or what to think. I pave my own path but I don\u2019t know how to pave. I don\u2019t know how to paint a pretty picture or how to craft. \n\nI\u2019m a ticking time bomb. My hands are the matches and my brain the fuse. I want to light it so I don\u2019t have to think or ever feel sad again. \n\nI think of dying.

But as I sat there in the silence of my anger, I didn&amp;#39;t hear them... and I did something that I regret, I wrote my suicide note... I did, And I hate that I did, But I did... Which scares me... I am very anti-self-harm and I hate when people say that they are gonna kill themselves or cut themself or on and on. Fast forward a few days and I am still talking to this girl online, But in secret, Only at night and on a hidden laptop... And It dawns on me that I haven&amp;#39;t heard the voices in a long while and so after the call, I ask them, And they were still there, Just being quiet in fear of pushing me over the edge...

As a result I don\u2019t trust my own life experience and am pretty sure I\u2019m not worth the love and support I need to be healthy.  This has made getting away from my family and making my own way in the world extremely difficult as I cannot distinguish between a person\u2019s actual intentions and the way those intentions appear to me when filtered through the survival mechanism that has taken the place of my worldview, making me essentially just as toxic to them as my family was to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll be real with you, I\u2019m writing this at 2 am in my bathtub because of that Dan Harmon advice that\u2019s been going around on FB compounded with some shit my therapist said a few months ago.  Basically I need to get all my crazy out in words, something I\u2019ve been putting off for years because even thinking about it is exhausting so how much worse will it be to actually do it?  Buuuut it turns out holding in 25 years of trauma is exhausting in its own way and I have too much shit to do over the next few years to afford the energy needed to keep my mouth shut on this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On March 22, 2017 my apartment burned down, taking with it my cat who was for a year literally the only living thing that seemed genuinely happy to see me, my birds (one of whom hatched in my bedroom), two friendships (the people are fine but our relationships are not), and nearly all my worldly possessions.  Full disclosure \u2013 there were things I could have done to prevent the fire.  My therapist has stressed multiple times that I cannot blame myself for this but the fact remains that I made mistakes that contributed to the deaths of four living things whose lives it was my job to protect.  That cannot be circumvented by any amount of psychotherapy and it frustrates me when people try to tell me not to feel guilty because it\u2019s not my fault when in practice the only thing missing from essentially arson was an intent to do harm.  Honestly, that may sound dramatic for someone who survived a kitchen fire and should be glad no human beings got hurt, but I can be hard on myself sometimes.  Anyway after the fire I moved back in with my parents with whom my relationship is\u2026 difficult for reasons I shall now explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my mother found out she was pregnant with me (her 4th child, my dad\u2019s 1st and thankfully last, seriously the fact that I share his genes is reason enough to avoid me like Chernobyl) she told my dad and then took a picture of his reaction, which was to slump against the toilet with the dejected face of someone who has just lost a loved one.  Then the two of them made the conscious decision to develop that photograph and use it as the opener to the baby book they made for me.  Then when I was old enough to understand that I was not only unplanned but extremely unlikely, they showed me the picture of my father being crushed by the knowledge of my existence.  This probably began my irrational hatred of men.  NOTE: BEFORE YOU GET ON MY CASE FOR THIS, REALIZE THAT I RECOGNIZE THIS IS AN IRRATIONAL HATRED.  IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REALIZE THIS AND I STILL HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF DAILY.  YOUR MOUTH-BREATHING WILL ONLY MAKE SHIT WORSE.  Realize also that this is not the only reason for this hatred.  This is only the first of many.  I should also note here that my mother was on birth control and they used spermicidal condoms but I still happened.  Some people say this should make me feel special or invincible or some shit but really it makes me feel like the people who made me didn\u2019t want me but I was so fucking rude that I imposed anyway.  Shitty hospital staff means my mom also got to guilt me for almost killing her, to which I desperately wanted to scream \u201cI WAS BORN AFTER ROE V WADE.  YOU COULD HAVE PAID SOMEONE TO CUT ME OUT OF YOU WHEN I WAS THE SIZE OF A WALNUT AND TOSS ME IN A DUMPSTER FOR FUCK\u2019S SAKE. YOU COULD HAVE SUED THE HOSPITAL FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, YOU COULD HAVE SUED THE CONDOM COMPANY, THE BIRTH CONTROL COMPANY, YOU COULD HAVE FUCKING SOLD ME.  THERE WERE THINGS YOU COULD DO TO GET RID OF ME IF YOU DON\u2019T WANT ME, WAYS YOU COULD HAVE MADE BACK ALL THE MONEY YOU WASTED ON RAISING ME.  HELL, CUT ME A BIG ENOUGH CHECK AND I\u2019LL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM OF MY EXISTENCE ON MY OWN.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should also note this baby book contained letters from my sisters.  They are not the only kind things my sisters have said to me, but they are the kindest and the competition was not as steep as one would expect for someone who has had 25 years to come up with something better than \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, I hope you\u2019re a boy.\u201d  By the way, I am not a boy.  This is probably good because if I was I would have killed myself for sure.  Not saying males should kill themselves or that I would hate myself more for being male, just saying that I am already aggressive enough and already encouraged enough to bottle my emotions up that any additional pressure to be aggressive or repress shit would have resulted in me shooting up my church/school/cult??? and then myself.  Honestly there were years when I thought that I would end up going that route anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.  Fast forward.  I am here, for worse.  I was an angry baby because they had to break my collarbone to get me out of my mother because if she wanted a c-section she should have found out she was pregnant earlier and nailed down a better doctor (according to a relative\u2019s account of what a medical professional may have said).  Not my fault, sure, but still my parents\u2019 problem, and it probably affected their initial reactions to me as a burdensome piece of shit.  My sisters kinda liked me though, so much so that I realized as an infant that I could fake-cry to get attention.  Once my mother realized how manipulative her four-month-old was she ordered my sisters to stop giving me attention when I sought it out.  Boy fucking howdy did they take that shit to heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad, in a shocking contrast to the abusive behavior he had exhibited toward my mother and half-sisters literally 2 hours after the wedding (Christian, no divorce, she was his bitch now), turned out to be TOTALLY NOT CUT OUT FOR INTERACTING WITH AN INFANT IN ANY WAY.  Sorry, did I say shocking contrast? I meat \u201cobvious logical progression of events that happens when your future mother in law says you can stay with her whenever her son gets violently angry and you go ahead and marry the guy anyway and then HAVE A KID WITH HIM.\u201d   For me this meant I had to learn how to communicate almost immediately.  I am not exaggerating, nor am I bragging, when I say I was talking fluently at age 2.  The genes that allow this came from my father and they came with a shit ton of mental health issues so I can confidently say I would rather have been born tongueless to a loving family than be ahead of the curve simply because if I did not develop my (genetically assisted) ability to communicate with the much larger, stronger people in my family I could very well have been hurt even worse than I was.  How was I hurt, you ask?  Lots of you won\u2019t be surprised.  Some of you may even think I had it easy.  If you fall into the second group then I want you to know that your own abusers deserve the worst kind of suffering for hurting you because I cannot imagine feeling worse than I do now.  If you think I had it easy it is because you have survived some unsurvivable shit and you have my props.  Others among you might be shocked that people can do some of this shit to a toddler and hey, I wish I was one of you lucky unabused niddymugginses.  Unfortunately, my right to be shocked at the cruelty of humans was robbed from me around the time I realized that just because my father handed me something and told me to lick it didn\u2019t mean I should.  Dunno if you know how 9-volt batteries taste, but the short answer from a pre-schooler\u2019s perspective is it tastes like OOOOWWWW DAD NOOOOOO.  Yes, I realize that technically this instance is an example of someone literally being shocked by the cruelty of another person but let me tell you it was the last time for me both literally and figuratively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other shit he liked to pull (and was allowed to pull because my mother dissociated for like the first solid 3 years of my life and pretty much let a violent psychopath run her children\u2019s lives) was to chase my half-sisters up the stairs screaming for petty offenses like leaving a light on or bringing food upstairs, tell me I was lying (at age like 2 or 3, mind you) if I told him I was unable to stop crying (he hated the sound of infants crying which is pretty much a human universal because in a normal person it motivates you to satisfy their basic survival needs), and as a second resort would just squeeze my windpipe until I was forced to choose between crying and oxygen.  Fun fact, while you cannot reason with the conscious part of a toddler\u2019s brain, literally every bit of nerve tissue in their entire body pays attention when you FUCKING STRANGLE THEM.  There have been times when I\u2019ve been crying extremely hard (like the kind where you lose track of what the rest of your body is doing) I\u2019ve caught myself choking myself.  Being a red-blooded American Christian household corporal punishment was a mandate from god and if I was bad I got spanked.  2 things though.  First, \u201cbad\u201d was highly subjective and depended entirely on my parents\u2019 current mood, and second, \u201cspanked\u201d herein means \u201cDad had a long day at work and is very tired and wanted to go home and go to bed but instead he has to parent his disgustingly naughty child so he is going to make sure she feels every ounce of irritation he feels at her, her mother, her siblings, and his coworkers.  Huh, reeeeally seems like a certain preschool-aged shithead should have taken her nap like a good girl.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weirdly though, despite making it clear that I basically imposed on my family by daring to be born, my parents were obsessed with me.  When he was not abusing me for the crime of being a normal child my father was teaching me advanced mathematics and getting frustrated because 4-year-olds are really bad at calculus, and once my mother was done dissociating from the terrible environment she willingly forced her kids into she quit her job so she could stay home with me, essentially reducing me to her pet.  By this I mean I was always by her side so much so that my sisters would start saying snide, mean-spirited things about how much time we spent together.  I also mean that she arrested my development either due to not really viewing me as an entire person, or due to wanting to keep me dependent on her longer so she can still feel useful as a person (because her religion reduces woman to either mother or waste of space).  Very little effort was put into potty training me \u2013 they would half-assed plop me on the toilet a few times a day and then get frustrated any time I had an accident.  Finally when I was like 3 or 4 they sat me aside, said no one at school would like me if I kept shitting myself, and sort of left me to my own devices after that.  Thankfully I got a handle on it in like 3 weeks because I wanted people to like me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sisters by this time had started to resent me because 1) I was my father\u2019s only biological kid and the only one of my mother\u2019s children to really know my father (I often wish I didn\u2019t) and 2) the abuse they were subjected to was different from the abuse I endured.  This is because they were older \u2013 if you try to strangle an angry 15-year-old you may very well find yourself murdered and strung up all cool like in NBC\u2019s Hannibal.  You can, however, withhold nonessential resources from them such as money for field trips or fees to be on extracurricular sports teams simply because \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to raise you, it\u2019s your own father\u2019s job.  I\u2019m already a saint for feeding you and letting you live in my home.\u201d  By the time I was old enough for field trips and extracurriculars I had been so terrified into obedience that I was \u201crewarded\u201d for my \u201cexemplary behavior\u201d by not having to get a job in high school to pay for my own field trips.  I should note now that my father has a PhD and works for a Fortune 500 company so money was not the issue here.   Spite was the issue here.  Whether deliberately or not, he pitted me and my sisters against each other \u2013 making sure they knew that they didn\u2019t get the things I did because they were bad and I was good, and making sure I kept cooperating with his abusive regime for fear of being treated the way he treated my sisters.  He used to take me to get donuts every Saturday and the only topic of conversation was my sisters and how ungrateful they were and how they\u2019re forever shafted because their dads were deadbeats and how I have to be careful not to be like them.   I shouldn\u2019t have been okay with it but I was 5 and I wanted a donut and my dad\u2019s approval.  You know, normal 5-year-old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a ton more that happened in the home, but we\u2019re already several pages in and I\u2019m starting to ramble.  I\u2019ve mentioned with no shortage of resentment bordering on homicidal rage that I was raised Christian, if by Christian you mean \u201cbiblical literalist, misogynistic, xenophobic quasi-cult run by a soft-headed bitch who kept hiring child molesters despite the fact that with each one she hired 30 people left the community until by the time I was an adult the church/school/I\u2019m-gonna-just-call-it-a-cult had collapsed on itself and at least one of the \u201cupstanding men of God\u201d who liked to rape children got arrested and is going to die in prison.  My understanding from the way the information was presented to me is that I am expected to pity him for this not-even-harsh-enough-to-be-called justice.  Anyway, before I get too into it I should explain why I keep referring to it as a cult.  Literally no one I have talked to about my church experience has said \u201cyeah that\u2019s typical\u201d or \u201cwhat a healthy supportive spiritual community\u201d or even \u201call of the things your pastor says actually come from the bible.\u201d  It was weirdly misogynistic, even by religious standards.  They loooooved reminding everyone (children included) that Eve fucked humanity over and that means that women should keep suffering through the god-ordained agony of complicated pregnancies and childbirth until they finally had the good grace to bleed out and die.  They literally treated obstetric care as a violation of god\u2019s will and by extension my mother\u2019s survival of my birth was treated with suspicion and she definitely lost status in the church after I was born.  They also loved talking about how gays are bad because no man should be so cruel to another man as to \u201cwomanize\u201d him, and no one should love and respect a woman enough to elevate her to \u201cman\u201d status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I have that bolded disclaimer about my issues with men.  I was raised in an environment where I was routinely told by nearly every man in my life that I was worthless and deserved to die a painful but perfectly preventable death.  Perhaps not in those exact words, but again I was a child and they were adults who saw fit to tell a child her life was going to suck and rightly so because of a myth so forgive me for going a bit far in my extrapolation.  It should also be noted that the boys in my church were allowed to be awful to the girls and women with literally no consequences so it wasn\u2019t like I could separate out kids being shitty from adults raised in a backward culture doing everything in their power to keep that backward culture alive.  To my very scared, very hurt, very young mind it looked like god created men specifically to hurt women and that for some reason that was the morally correct way of the world and I was evil and against god for thinking that this whole thing was wildly unfair.  My father did not help this because he was a total devil\u2019s advocate \u2013 \u201cWell they probably don\u2019t look at women\u2019s perspectives because they have no reason to.  Women have to because men are in power but women aren\u2019t so men have no reason to care, so why are you upset at things being unfair?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Church wasn\u2019t enough for my batshit insane parents so they enrolled me at the affiliated school where I went from weekly vagina-shamings to daily ones.  It also meant I had no escape from the aforementioned shithead boys.  Now that I am an adult I realize that I was also exposed to a shit ton of unnecessarily cruel girls as well, but by that point gender had been solidified in my mind as a zero-sum war for survival.  I thought that if I was willing to compromise and say both males and females can be bad people, that would be viewed as weakness, proof women are bad, and ultimately justification for me to be married off and raped to death if only those goddamned liberals hadn\u2019t outlawed a father\u2019s sovereign right to do what he wants to any female objects his uterus-with-an-irritating-maintenance-system gives him.  So basically, certain shitty aspects of a shitty environment were magnified in my life in such a way that I was at constant odds with the golden children who made the morally upright decision of missing an X chromosome.  This meant that the adults thought I was a wicked little upstart who deserved any mistreatment she got, and as such kids were just sort of allowed to be cruel to me.  No one would step in.  One teacher even threatened me with detention if I told her I was being bullied one more time.  Granted, my parents did try to get the principal to do something, but she was too busy interviewing pedophiles for teaching positions at her grade school to give a shit about an unpopular kid with unpopular parents being bullied by the sons of several prominent families in the church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was in grade \u201cschool\u201d (in quotes because I later learned none of the teachers were accredited) my older sisters began following my mother\u2019s noble tradition of getting knocked up by worthless slag heaps with no jobs, alcoholics with severely arrested development (in the tv show sense of just acting like children despite being fully capable adults), and abusive monsters with just enough clout to pull the \u201cyou\u2019d be nothing without me\u201d bullshit that I maintain should be a capital offense.  Of course this meant everyone in my life had to make sure I knew that a woman\u2019s job is to both please men sexually AND protect her sexual purity for marriage so basically my sisters were godless cunts for not having sex AND godless cunts for having sex AND SUPER EXTRA SATANIC GODLESS CUNTS for getting pregnant.  So, suddenly, halfway through the worst decades of everyone in the household\u2019s lives, another innocent baby got thrown into the mix.  My niece had the advantage of a mother who could protect her from the worst of my parents\u2019 crazy, but she still had it rough.  Once she was mad at me when she was like 2 so she unplugged my computer.  This was back when that could cause serious issues on a desktop so when I told my mother and sister they said to tell my dad so he could fix it.  Instead of fixing it he gets 2 inches from my baby niece\u2019s face and starts screaming at her like she was a fully-grown coworker who sabotaged the company.  Well, obviously this behavior is unacceptable and the person responsible should be stopped.  EXCEPT by my family\u2019s cowardly logic the fact that I was less likely to physically harm anyone I was the one responsible.  \u201cWhat were you thinking telling your dad about that computer, you knew he would freak out on your niece, next time don\u2019t you dare do that!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I got older and even more poorly-adjusted to the world and my place in it (if you can even make the argument that I have a place in the world which, if you can, please send it to me because I have not been able to come up with one), I began to model some of my father\u2019s toxic behavior in my relationships with my family.  Not only was I punished for this behavior whereas he was generally allowed to do what he wanted, but my sisters still have not really gotten over it.  I\u2019m 25 now and they still act like I\u2019m some volatile little hobgoblin who will get angry enough to black out and forget what even pissed me off in the first place in my determination to cause pain.  I do not do that anymore.  I made and am still making conscious efforts to excise every tumorous bit of my father\u2019s influence on my behavior but they will never recognize it except to say something like \u201cyou\u2019re not as bad as you used to be but you need to understand that we\u2019re expecting you to be better so your current progress really doesn\u2019t matter as much as you think it does.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I graduated that hellhole of a Jesus \u201cschool\u201d and my indoctrination into the cult of hatred that was my parents\u2019 version of Christianity was reduced back to the weekly church bullshit.  By this time we have a new misogynist-in-chief in the form of a pastor from Florida who would sit on, throw things at, and on one occasion rip the clothing of confirmation students.  He tried to convince me that women\u2019s periods were making them turn to witchcraft and got extremely pissed off when I pointed out that maybe instead of being driven to witchcraft women were being driven away from his god due to misogynists like him.  (Not in those words, obviously.  It was more of a \u201cMaybe they are frustrated with the limited opportunities women have to get involved in Christianity and are looking for a faith that allows them more fulfillment and agency\u201d which in macho-Jesus-man-speak was basically the verbal equivalent of emptying a menstrual cup directly into his mouth.)  But despite these weekly arguments (and on one occasion almost physical altercation on my end because no grown man should say things like that to a child I swear to nonexistent god I wish I had cut his tongue out and shoved it so far back up his ass that it made its way back to his mouth) wow that sentence got away from me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, despite these weekly fiascos I was free from a great deal of the mental torture I had suffered for nearly a decade.  Everyone at church commented on how much better I looked since leaving the shitty jesus school which should have been a huge clue for my parents to stop dragging me to church BUT they continued forcing me to cult meetings every week until one extremely terrible Sunday on which my father exposed his ass to me in a 7-eleven parking lot and then pulled me out of church 5 minutes before I was supposed to do the reading in front of the whole congregation to yell at me that he mooned me as a sign of contempt.  I don\u2019t even remember what I did to piss him off so much that he felt the need to treat his only child with contempt but there you go.  Needless to say I burst into tears, told the elder I couldn\u2019t do the reading, got chewed out by the elder for being such a flaky teenaged GIRL, and stormed into the parking lot to cry next to my old crying tree from grade school.  Oh yeah, I spent so many recesses hiding from the other kids and crying that I even had a favorite tree to sit near when I did so.  Should be noted that I was not allowed to bring books or sketchpads or to stay inside with the other teachers or literally anything besides hide in the bushes to avoid having kickballs thrown at my head.  Anyway, after the awful church disaster my mother pulled me aside to tell me she is disappointed in me and that I am no longer welcome at church until I fix my attitude which on one had was great because no more religiously-motivated-hate seminars but on the other hand stung a lot.  For one, rather than honor my request to not be brought to an environment that causes me pain she waited until that pain bubbled over and then \u201cpunished\u201d me by \u201crevoking\u201d my churchgoer status.  For another, while I no longer believe in the existence of any higher power, at the time it sounded like she was so sick of my behavior (but curiously not my father\u2019s behavior) that she was willing to gamble my immortal soul on my ability to magically, at the age of 17, while simultaneously dealing with some heavy shit at school (unrelated, not long-term traumatizing, really a funny story now that I\u2019m older), to change her attitude in a world where she had only had two attitudes modeled \u2013 aggressively hateful or so passive I might as well be dead.  Even today she still believes in all that and keeps pressuring me to go to church.  I reminded her last time she did this that she was the one who told me not to bother coming to church anymore and she insisted she had no recollection of this event.  She has no recollection of a lot of events from my childhood, which if she is lying is some fucking grade A gaslighting on her part because therapists have gotten soooooo fucking sick of telling me that from what they\u2019ve heard of my life they can confidently say that at least some of the abuse actually happened.  I still have difficulty sometimes with really confronting the fact that yes, bad things were done to me as a child and yes, those things were bad enough to be considered abuse and no, I am not delusional or manipulative or some other kind of awful monster acting with intent to harm my family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once I no longer had to go to church people started commenting on how much healthier I looked.  Hooo boy can you bet that not a single person in my life made the connection between me leaving the cult and me gleaning some happiness out of the world.  How did I get that glow, that bounce in my step, that smile?  It\u2019s a fucking mystery, let\u2019s ask god what happened.  College hit and I finally accepted what I kind of knew all along \u2013 I have no fucking business with organized religion, I disagree with the church on every important social issue, and I legitimately think that no one has been able to demonstrate with any degree of confidence that there are such things as gods.  I also developed a passion for animal care and began applying to graduate programs where I could, without getting too technical, work with abused animals who display behavior issues like aggression towards humans because these animals were raised in unhealthy environments by humans.  It\u2019s a little clich\u00e9, I know, but I need to work with living things whose anger stems from pain because that is me all over.  I feel like they don\u2019t judge anyone for being angry at abuse because they themselves are angry at it.  I never get that feeling with humans.  They\u2019re sad for me, and if they\u2019ve suffered they\u2019re often sad for themselves as well.  But they never get so angry that they can look into the eyes of the person feeding them with such intense rage because just because someone feeds you doesn\u2019t mean they give a shit about your overall wellbeing, then proceed to attempt to scare that human (the one with the food) away.  I know that feeling.  I\u2019ve been so hurt by people that my first instinct is to scare them away first, even (dare I say especially?) if they were only attempting to provide some form of help or support.  For so long I felt like shit because I do this but I figured if I can look into the face of an animal that has a completely understandable desire to murder me and still want nothing but the best for that animal, then maybe it is possible for humans to be kind.  Maybe it is even possible for them to be kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after a round of rejections, some real world work experience, and a second attempt at applying, I was accepted into my dream graduate school.  Two weeks later the aforementioned apartment fire occurred, and for 3 months after I was too borderline suicidal to appreciate that I had actually accomplished something pretty fucking cool.  My parents tried to be supportive but as you may have guessed they cannot do that thing even if they try.  Also they can only keep up the attempt for a week or so so when it turned out that trauma doesn\u2019t just evaporate they threatened to have me committed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little bit of therapy and a whole lot of apathy later and I managed to get back on civil terms with my parents and they helped me move out of state (tearfully, in my mother\u2019s case).  Now I\u2019m here, finally over a thousand miles away from the toxicity of my childhood and integrating into a world where abuse is not the norm has been almost as bad as the abuse itself.  People do not understand my preparedness to fight.  Not argue, not debate, not even get a little snippy.  Full on trial-by-combat let the Many Faced God decide who is right and who should have fucking thought before she made that snide comment if she wanted to continue living FIGHT.  My therapist said it had to do with an overactive sympathetic nervous system, essentially my family pressed caps lock on my fight or flight response then pried off the key so I can never really come back down from thinking I am in perpetual danger.  Oftentimes this means some stressed out white man says something offhand and slightly rude, but not meant as a personal attack, and if I can I freak out and threaten his life and if I am not in a position where that would be feasible I glare at him and maybe knock something over for emphasis.  Not necessarily healthy, but satisfying to know that someone who probably never had anything truly terrible happen to him knows, for at least a split second, that if he fucks with me HE DIES SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY AND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ANY LIVING RELATIVES WHO MIGHT BE ALSO CAUSED PAIN BY HIS DEATH BECAUSE FUCK HIM AND ANYONE WHO DARES THINK HE IS A WORTHWHILE HUMAN BEING BECAUSE\nWORTHWHILE\nHUMAN\nBEINGS\nDO\nNOT\nTREAT\nME\nLIKE\nMY\nPARENTS\nDID.\nA dangerous attitude since guns are easier to obtain here.  On that note, while I want a gun (mostly to defend myself against gun-rights-activists. Call it hypocrisy and I call you dead-to-me) I realize that I am probably more likely to use it on myself than on any of the other people who deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway.  I\u2019m here, I don\u2019t know who the fuck I am because for the past 25 years I haven\u2019t really been allowed to just BE.  I was always told my emotions were either factually or morally incorrect so now when I have a feeling it feels like air raid sirens going off and I literally have to remove myself from situations that normal, well-adjusted, societally worthwhile people can handle.  And I can\u2019t really trust anyone to care about my pain because, in the words of my pernicious half-sister \u201cNo one has to be nice to you.\u201d  Note that she said this while I was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of my car seriously contemplating revving it up to 60 and crashing into a brick wall.  Apparently this was supposed to convince me to be happy and live my life.  For some reason no one in my family realizes that I need emotional support sometimes, like when I lose all my possessions and my pets and the security of a roof over my head to a traumatic disaster such as a fire.  The worst parts of my suicidal depression were happening when I was trying to deal with insurance and the cleaning company and property management was doing everything in their power to threaten me and bully me into\u2026 what? I don\u2019t know because whenever I called to ask what exactly I need to do to get them to stop exacerbating my desire to drown myself they would ignore my calls.  How supportive was my family during this time? Well, do me a favor and dunk a loaf of wonderbread in water then see how well it supports things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah, I should also note that the sister who told me no one has to be nice to me has also told another suicidal sister of mine to stop talking about it and just do it.  She is a schoolteacher, this psychotic, compassionless shitstain.  She is a school teacher as a backup career because she could not hack it as a counsellor or therapist.  Probably because she kept telling suicidal people who took the terrifying step of reaching out for help that if they really want to die they should just fucking do it aleady.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I don\u2019t trust people to care about my wellbeing because if my own family can\u2019t, why should anyone else?  Also, the fact that I need care means that I am incapable of providing it and therefore I am a drain on every social relationship I maintain.  People say I should focus on caring for myself but 1) if I am worthless why should I care about me and 2) if I do care about me, my opinion of me is worthless because I am worthless.  No amount of thinking can get me past that \u2013 from a social standpoint I am a terrible investment and while I wish someone would be my friend I honestly can\u2019t blame them for not wanting to.  I feel like I need someone to see some good in me before I can say that I have anything good in me and not have it feel like a manipulative lie I tell myself to excuse myself from the terrible effects my existence had on my family.  But because I realize that you\u2019d have to be crazy to want to help me I have a hard time trusting people who show me kindness because they are either insane or plotting something or just generally nice to everyone.  Goddamn I wish I knew how it felt to have someone be nice to me because I am simply special to them.  Not special to the world in general, I just want one single person to rank me as one of the important people in their lives.  I also can\u2019t set boundaries because my father treated boundary violation as an Olympic sport.  I don\u2019t know how I feel about hugs because while I recognize I probably need one, my father used to yell, hit me, then pull me into a crushing, painful smothering attempt he called a \u201chug\u201d and refused to let me go no matter how much I kicked, screamed, and tried to pull away.  So basically my modes are \u201cLook at me and I will gnaw your face off like I am a captive chimpanzee and you are a moron who thinks it\u2019s a good idea to get in the face of a captive chimpanzee\u201d or \u201csure, do whatever, want my kidney while you\u2019re at it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that I can say terrible shit about professors to my classmates \u2013 \u201cJudging from how she refused to answer any clarifying questions on our debate prompts combined with the fact that several people have warned me she loves starting drama I think that this whole quarter was her trying to pit us against each other for her own gain and I am really glad I will never take another class with her.  Furthermore, if she is so concerned with ethics then why is she planning all this contentious bullshit in our first quarter where we need to make good impressions on each other?\u201d  Then when they say I should be ashamed for thinking that, let alone saying it, I roll over and say they\u2019re absolutely right, my perspective on the world is cruel and factually wrong if not straight-up delusional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well one of them has taken this as permission to joke about the fact that my home burned down.  I don\u2019t know how to confront her on it without screaming at her that she had better goddamned drop out and move away if she knows what\u2019s good for her, her parents, her siblings, and anyone else who ever gave her an ounce of support or approval.  Granted, I made a couple jokes about it both as a coping mechanism for myself as I am the one who put the work into not just shriveling up and dying over the summer and as a way to introduce the topic of \u201chey I am coming down from the most traumatic experience of my adult life and I\u2019m doing a thousand miles away from the people who should have been there to support me\u201d so people understand why I\u2019m such a mess.  I guess I\u2019m just going to have to say it in those words because clearly the only people who understand that trauma is bad for a person\u2019s health are others who have been through trauma.  Which.  Wow.  If you can\u2019t understand that \u201cI lost my home and am laughing really loudly about it because the alternative is sobbing while clutching a pillow like a rejected Harry Harlow experiment\u201d then your problem isn\u2019t lack of trauma, it\u2019s lack of basic human empathy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, thanks.  If you skipped over most of it, understandable.  It\u2019s 10 pages single spaced after all.  I\u2019m probably going to print this out later to take to my school\u2019s counselling center because it\u2019s easier than trying to articulate this whole mess in front of a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR:  I was abused and neglected as a child both by my family and the church they forced me to attend 6 days a week for 9 years.  As a result I don\u2019t trust my own life experience and am pretty sure I\u2019m not worth the love and support I need to be healthy.  This has made getting away from my family and making my own way in the world extremely difficult as I cannot distinguish between a person\u2019s actual intentions and the way those intentions appear to me when filtered through the survival mechanism that has taken the place of my worldview, making me essentially just as toxic to them as my family was to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "TLDR:  I was abused and neglected as a child both by my family and the church they forced me to attend 6 days a week for 9 years.

Basically I need to get all my crazy out in words, something I\u2019ve been putting off for years because even thinking about it is exhausting so how much worse will it be to actually do it?  Buuuut it turns out holding in 25 years of trauma is exhausting in its own way and I have too much shit to do over the next few years to afford the energy needed to keep my mouth shut on this.\n\nOn March 22, 2017 my apartment burned down, taking with it my cat who was for a year literally the only living thing that seemed genuinely happy to see me, my birds (one of whom hatched in my bedroom), two friendships (the people are fine but our relationships are not), and nearly all my worldly possessions.  Full disclosure \u2013 there were things I could have done to prevent the fire.  My therapist has stressed multiple times that I cannot blame myself for this but the fact remains that I made mistakes that contributed to the deaths of four living things whose lives it was my job to protect.  That cannot be circumvented by any amount of psychotherapy and it frustrates me when people try to tell me not to feel guilty because it\u2019s not my fault when in practice the only thing missing from essentially arson was an intent to do harm.  Honestly, that may sound dramatic for someone who survived a kitchen fire and should be glad no human beings got hurt, but I can be hard on myself sometimes.  Anyway after the fire I moved back in with my parents with whom my relationship is\u2026 difficult for reasons I shall now explain.\n\nWhen my mother found out she was pregnant with me (her 4th child, my dad\u2019s 1st and thankfully last, seriously the fact that I share his genes is reason enough to avoid me like Chernobyl) she told my dad and then took a picture of his reaction, which was to slump against the toilet with the dejected face of someone who has just lost a loved one.  Then the two of them made the conscious decision to develop that photograph and use it as the opener to the baby book they made for me.  Then when I was old enough to understand that I was not only unplanned but extremely unlikely, they showed me the picture of my father being crushed by the knowledge of my existence.  This probably began my irrational hatred of men.  NOTE: BEFORE YOU GET ON MY CASE FOR THIS, REALIZE THAT I RECOGNIZE THIS IS AN IRRATIONAL HATRED.  IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REALIZE THIS AND I STILL HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF DAILY.  YOUR MOUTH-BREATHING WILL ONLY MAKE SHIT WORSE.  Realize also that this is not the only reason for this hatred.  This is only the first of many.  I should also note here that my mother was on birth control and they used spermicidal condoms but I still happened.  Some people say this should make me feel special or invincible or some shit but really it makes me feel like the people who made me didn\u2019t want me but I was so fucking rude that I imposed anyway.  Shitty hospital staff means my mom also got to guilt me for almost killing her, to which I desperately wanted to scream \u201cI WAS BORN AFTER ROE V WADE.  YOU COULD HAVE PAID SOMEONE TO CUT ME OUT OF YOU WHEN I WAS THE SIZE OF A WALNUT AND TOSS ME IN A DUMPSTER FOR FUCK\u2019S SAKE. YOU COULD HAVE SUED THE HOSPITAL FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, YOU COULD HAVE SUED THE CONDOM COMPANY, THE BIRTH CONTROL COMPANY, YOU COULD HAVE FUCKING SOLD ME.  THERE WERE THINGS YOU COULD DO TO GET RID OF ME IF YOU DON\u2019T WANT ME, WAYS YOU COULD HAVE MADE BACK ALL THE MONEY YOU WASTED ON RAISING ME.  HELL, CUT ME A BIG ENOUGH CHECK AND I\u2019LL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM OF MY EXISTENCE ON MY OWN.\u201d\n\nI should also note this baby book contained letters from my sisters.  They are not the only kind things my sisters have said to me, but they are the kindest and the competition was not as steep as one would expect for someone who has had 25 years to come up with something better than \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you, I hope you\u2019re a boy.\u201d  By the way, I am not a boy.  This is probably good because if I was I would have killed myself for sure.  Not saying males should kill themselves or that I would hate myself more for being male, just saying that I am already aggressive enough and already encouraged enough to bottle my emotions up that any additional pressure to be aggressive or repress shit would have resulted in me shooting up my church/school/cult??? and then myself.  Honestly there were years when I thought that I would end up going that route anyway.\n\nSo.  Fast forward.  I am here, for worse.  I was an angry baby because they had to break my collarbone to get me out of my mother because if she wanted a c-section she should have found out she was pregnant earlier and nailed down a better doctor (according to a relative\u2019s account of what a medical professional may have said).  Not my fault, sure, but still my parents\u2019 problem, and it probably affected their initial reactions to me as a burdensome piece of shit.  My sisters kinda liked me though, so much so that I realized as an infant that I could fake-cry to get attention.  Once my mother realized how manipulative her four-month-old was she ordered my sisters to stop giving me attention when I sought it out.  Boy fucking howdy did they take that shit to heart.\n\nMy dad, in a shocking contrast to the abusive behavior he had exhibited toward my mother and half-sisters literally 2 hours after the wedding (Christian, no divorce, she was his bitch now), turned out to be TOTALLY NOT CUT OUT FOR INTERACTING WITH AN INFANT IN ANY WAY.  Sorry, did I say shocking contrast? I meat \u201cobvious logical progression of events that happens when your future mother in law says you can stay with her whenever her son gets violently angry and you go ahead and marry the guy anyway and then HAVE A KID WITH HIM.\u201d   For me this meant I had to learn how to communicate almost immediately.  I am not exaggerating, nor am I bragging, when I say I was talking fluently at age 2.  The genes that allow this came from my father and they came with a shit ton of mental health issues so I can confidently say I would rather have been born tongueless to a loving family than be ahead of the curve simply because if I did not develop my (genetically assisted) ability to communicate with the much larger, stronger people in my family I could very well have been hurt even worse than I was.  How was I hurt, you ask?  Lots of you won\u2019t be surprised.  Some of you may even think I had it easy.  If you fall into the second group then I want you to know that your own abusers deserve the worst kind of suffering for hurting you because I cannot imagine feeling worse than I do now.  If you think I had it easy it is because you have survived some unsurvivable shit and you have my props.  Others among you might be shocked that people can do some of this shit to a toddler and hey, I wish I was one of you lucky unabused niddymugginses.  Unfortunately, my right to be shocked at the cruelty of humans was robbed from me around the time I realized that just because my father handed me something and told me to lick it didn\u2019t mean I should.  Dunno if you know how 9-volt batteries taste, but the short answer from a pre-schooler\u2019s perspective is it tastes like OOOOWWWW DAD NOOOOOO.  Yes, I realize that technically this instance is an example of someone literally being shocked by the cruelty of another person but let me tell you it was the last time for me both literally and figuratively.\n\nOther shit he liked to pull (and was allowed to pull because my mother dissociated for like the first solid 3 years of my life and pretty much let a violent psychopath run her children\u2019s lives) was to chase my half-sisters up the stairs screaming for petty offenses like leaving a light on or bringing food upstairs, tell me I was lying (at age like 2 or 3, mind you) if I told him I was unable to stop crying (he hated the sound of infants crying which is pretty much a human universal because in a normal person it motivates you to satisfy their basic survival needs), and as a second resort would just squeeze my windpipe until I was forced to choose between crying and oxygen.  Fun fact, while you cannot reason with the conscious part of a toddler\u2019s brain, literally every bit of nerve tissue in their entire body pays attention when you FUCKING STRANGLE THEM.  There have been times when I\u2019ve been crying extremely hard (like the kind where you lose track of what the rest of your body is doing) I\u2019ve caught myself choking myself.  Being a red-blooded American Christian household corporal punishment was a mandate from god and if I was bad I got spanked.  2 things though.  First, \u201cbad\u201d was highly subjective and depended entirely on my parents\u2019 current mood, and second, \u201cspanked\u201d herein means \u201cDad had a long day at work and is very tired and wanted to go home and go to bed but instead he has to parent his disgustingly naughty child so he is going to make sure she feels every ounce of irritation he feels at her, her mother, her siblings, and his coworkers.  Huh, reeeeally seems like a certain preschool-aged shithead should have taken her nap like a good girl.\u201d\n\nWeirdly though, despite making it clear that I basically imposed on my family by daring to be born, my parents were obsessed with me.  When he was not abusing me for the crime of being a normal child my father was teaching me advanced mathematics and getting frustrated because 4-year-olds are really bad at calculus, and once my mother was done dissociating from the terrible environment she willingly forced her kids into she quit her job so she could stay home with me, essentially reducing me to her pet.  By this I mean I was always by her side so much so that my sisters would start saying snide, mean-spirited things about how much time we spent together.  I also mean that she arrested my development either due to not really viewing me as an entire person, or due to wanting to keep me dependent on her longer so she can still feel useful as a person (because her religion reduces woman to either mother or waste of space).  Very little effort was put into potty training me \u2013 they would half-assed plop me on the toilet a few times a day and then get frustrated any time I had an accident.  Finally when I was like 3 or 4 they sat me aside, said no one at school would like me if I kept shitting myself, and sort of left me to my own devices after that.  Thankfully I got a handle on it in like 3 weeks because I wanted people to like me.\n\nMy sisters by this time had started to resent me because 1) I was my father\u2019s only biological kid and the only one of my mother\u2019s children to really know my father (I often wish I didn\u2019t) and 2) the abuse they were subjected to was different from the abuse I endured.  This is because they were older \u2013 if you try to strangle an angry 15-year-old you may very well find yourself murdered and strung up all cool like in NBC\u2019s Hannibal.  You can, however, withhold nonessential resources from them such as money for field trips or fees to be on extracurricular sports teams simply because \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to raise you, it\u2019s your own father\u2019s job.  I\u2019m already a saint for feeding you and letting you live in my home.\u201d  By the time I was old enough for field trips and extracurriculars I had been so terrified into obedience that I was \u201crewarded\u201d for my \u201cexemplary behavior\u201d by not having to get a job in high school to pay for my own field trips.  I should note now that my father has a PhD and works for a Fortune 500 company so money was not the issue here.   Spite was the issue here.  Whether deliberately or not, he pitted me and my sisters against each other \u2013 making sure they knew that they didn\u2019t get the things I did because they were bad and I was good, and making sure I kept cooperating with his abusive regime for fear of being treated the way he treated my sisters.  He used to take me to get donuts every Saturday and the only topic of conversation was my sisters and how ungrateful they were and how they\u2019re forever shafted because their dads were deadbeats and how I have to be careful not to be like them.   I shouldn\u2019t have been okay with it but I was 5 and I wanted a donut and my dad\u2019s approval.  You know, normal 5-year-old stuff.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton more that happened in the home, but we\u2019re already several pages in and I\u2019m starting to ramble.  I\u2019ve mentioned with no shortage of resentment bordering on homicidal rage that I was raised Christian, if by Christian you mean \u201cbiblical literalist, misogynistic, xenophobic quasi-cult run by a soft-headed bitch who kept hiring child molesters despite the fact that with each one she hired 30 people left the community until by the time I was an adult the church/school/I\u2019m-gonna-just-call-it-a-cult had collapsed on itself and at least one of the \u201cupstanding men of God\u201d who liked to rape children got arrested and is going to die in prison.  My understanding from the way the information was presented to me is that I am expected to pity him for this not-even-harsh-enough-to-be-called justice.  Anyway, before I get too into it I should explain why I keep referring to it as a cult.  Literally no one I have talked to about my church experience has said \u201cyeah that\u2019s typical\u201d or \u201cwhat a healthy supportive spiritual community\u201d or even \u201call of the things your pastor says actually come from the bible.\u201d  It was weirdly misogynistic, even by religious standards.  They loooooved reminding everyone (children included) that Eve fucked humanity over and that means that women should keep suffering through the god-ordained agony of complicated pregnancies and childbirth until they finally had the good grace to bleed out and die.  They literally treated obstetric care as a violation of god\u2019s will and by extension my mother\u2019s survival of my birth was treated with suspicion and she definitely lost status in the church after I was born.  They also loved talking about how gays are bad because no man should be so cruel to another man as to \u201cwomanize\u201d him, and no one should love and respect a woman enough to elevate her to \u201cman\u201d status.\n\nThis is why I have that bolded disclaimer about my issues with men.  I was raised in an environment where I was routinely told by nearly every man in my life that I was worthless and deserved to die a painful but perfectly preventable death.  Perhaps not in those exact words, but again I was a child and they were adults who saw fit to tell a child her life was going to suck and rightly so because of a myth so forgive me for going a bit far in my extrapolation.  It should also be noted that the boys in my church were allowed to be awful to the girls and women with literally no consequences so it wasn\u2019t like I could separate out kids being shitty from adults raised in a backward culture doing everything in their power to keep that backward culture alive.  To my very scared, very hurt, very young mind it looked like god created men specifically to hurt women and that for some reason that was the morally correct way of the world and I was evil and against god for thinking that this whole thing was wildly unfair.  My father did not help this because he was a total devil\u2019s advocate \u2013 \u201cWell they probably don\u2019t look at women\u2019s perspectives because they have no reason to.  Women have to because men are in power but women aren\u2019t so men have no reason to care, so why are you upset at things being unfair?\u201d\n\nChurch wasn\u2019t enough for my batshit insane parents so they enrolled me at the affiliated school where I went from weekly vagina-shamings to daily ones.  It also meant I had no escape from the aforementioned shithead boys.  Now that I am an adult I realize that I was also exposed to a shit ton of unnecessarily cruel girls as well, but by that point gender had been solidified in my mind as a zero-sum war for survival.  I thought that if I was willing to compromise and say both males and females can be bad people, that would be viewed as weakness, proof women are bad, and ultimately justification for me to be married off and raped to death if only those goddamned liberals hadn\u2019t outlawed a father\u2019s sovereign right to do what he wants to any female objects his uterus-with-an-irritating-maintenance-system gives him.  So basically, certain shitty aspects of a shitty environment were magnified in my life in such a way that I was at constant odds with the golden children who made the morally upright decision of missing an X chromosome.  This meant that the adults thought I was a wicked little upstart who deserved any mistreatment she got, and as such kids were just sort of allowed to be cruel to me.  No one would step in.  One teacher even threatened me with detention if I told her I was being bullied one more time.  Granted, my parents did try to get the principal to do something, but she was too busy interviewing pedophiles for teaching positions at her grade school to give a shit about an unpopular kid with unpopular parents being bullied by the sons of several prominent families in the church.\n\nWhile I was in grade \u201cschool\u201d (in quotes because I later learned none of the teachers were accredited) my older sisters began following my mother\u2019s noble tradition of getting knocked up by worthless slag heaps with no jobs, alcoholics with severely arrested development (in the tv show sense of just acting like children despite being fully capable adults), and abusive monsters with just enough clout to pull the \u201cyou\u2019d be nothing without me\u201d bullshit that I maintain should be a capital offense.  Of course this meant everyone in my life had to make sure I knew that a woman\u2019s job is to both please men sexually AND protect her sexual purity for marriage so basically my sisters were godless cunts for not having sex AND godless cunts for having sex AND SUPER EXTRA SATANIC GODLESS CUNTS for getting pregnant.  So, suddenly, halfway through the worst decades of everyone in the household\u2019s lives, another innocent baby got thrown into the mix.  My niece had the advantage of a mother who could protect her from the worst of my parents\u2019 crazy, but she still had it rough.  Once she was mad at me when she was like 2 so she unplugged my computer.  This was back when that could cause serious issues on a desktop so when I told my mother and sister they said to tell my dad so he could fix it.  Instead of fixing it he gets 2 inches from my baby niece\u2019s face and starts screaming at her like she was a fully-grown coworker who sabotaged the company.  Well, obviously this behavior is unacceptable and the person responsible should be stopped.  EXCEPT by my family\u2019s cowardly logic the fact that I was less likely to physically harm anyone I was the one responsible.  \u201cWhat were you thinking telling your dad about that computer, you knew he would freak out on your niece, next time don\u2019t you dare do that!\u201d\n\nAs I got older and even more poorly-adjusted to the world and my place in it (if you can even make the argument that I have a place in the world which, if you can, please send it to me because I have not been able to come up with one), I began to model some of my father\u2019s toxic behavior in my relationships with my family.  Not only was I punished for this behavior whereas he was generally allowed to do what he wanted, but my sisters still have not really gotten over it.  I\u2019m 25 now and they still act like I\u2019m some volatile little hobgoblin who will get angry enough to black out and forget what even pissed me off in the first place in my determination to cause pain.  I do not do that anymore.  I made and am still making conscious efforts to excise every tumorous bit of my father\u2019s influence on my behavior but they will never recognize it except to say something like \u201cyou\u2019re not as bad as you used to be but you need to understand that we\u2019re expecting you to be better so your current progress really doesn\u2019t matter as much as you think it does.\u201d\n\nFinally I graduated that hellhole of a Jesus \u201cschool\u201d and my indoctrination into the cult of hatred that was my parents\u2019 version of Christianity was reduced back to the weekly church bullshit.  By this time we have a new misogynist-in-chief in the form of a pastor from Florida who would sit on, throw things at, and on one occasion rip the clothing of confirmation students.  He tried to convince me that women\u2019s periods were making them turn to witchcraft and got extremely pissed off when I pointed out that maybe instead of being driven to witchcraft women were being driven away from his god due to misogynists like him.  (Not in those words, obviously.  It was more of a \u201cMaybe they are frustrated with the limited opportunities women have to get involved in Christianity and are looking for a faith that allows them more fulfillment and agency\u201d which in macho-Jesus-man-speak was basically the verbal equivalent of emptying a menstrual cup directly into his mouth.)  But despite these weekly arguments (and on one occasion almost physical altercation on my end because no grown man should say things like that to a child I swear to nonexistent god I wish I had cut his tongue out and shoved it so far back up his ass that it made its way back to his mouth) wow that sentence got away from me.\n\nAnyway, despite these weekly fiascos I was free from a great deal of the mental torture I had suffered for nearly a decade.  Everyone at church commented on how much better I looked since leaving the shitty jesus school which should have been a huge clue for my parents to stop dragging me to church BUT they continued forcing me to cult meetings every week until one extremely terrible Sunday on which my father exposed his ass to me in a 7-eleven parking lot and then pulled me out of church 5 minutes before I was supposed to do the reading in front of the whole congregation to yell at me that he mooned me as a sign of contempt.  I don\u2019t even remember what I did to piss him off so much that he felt the need to treat his only child with contempt but there you go.  Needless to say I burst into tears, told the elder I couldn\u2019t do the reading, got chewed out by the elder for being such a flaky teenaged GIRL, and stormed into the parking lot to cry next to my old crying tree from grade school.  Oh yeah, I spent so many recesses hiding from the other kids and crying that I even had a favorite tree to sit near when I did so.  Should be noted that I was not allowed to bring books or sketchpads or to stay inside with the other teachers or literally anything besides hide in the bushes to avoid having kickballs thrown at my head.  Anyway, after the awful church disaster my mother pulled me aside to tell me she is disappointed in me and that I am no longer welcome at church until I fix my attitude which on one had was great because no more religiously-motivated-hate seminars but on the other hand stung a lot.  For one, rather than honor my request to not be brought to an environment that causes me pain she waited until that pain bubbled over and then \u201cpunished\u201d me by \u201crevoking\u201d my churchgoer status.  For another, while I no longer believe in the existence of any higher power, at the time it sounded like she was so sick of my behavior (but curiously not my father\u2019s behavior) that she was willing to gamble my immortal soul on my ability to magically, at the age of 17, while simultaneously dealing with some heavy shit at school (unrelated, not long-term traumatizing, really a funny story now that I\u2019m older), to change her attitude in a world where she had only had two attitudes modeled \u2013 aggressively hateful or so passive I might as well be dead.  Even today she still believes in all that and keeps pressuring me to go to church.  I reminded her last time she did this that she was the one who told me not to bother coming to church anymore and she insisted she had no recollection of this event.  She has no recollection of a lot of events from my childhood, which if she is lying is some fucking grade A gaslighting on her part because therapists have gotten soooooo fucking sick of telling me that from what they\u2019ve heard of my life they can confidently say that at least some of the abuse actually happened.  I still have difficulty sometimes with really confronting the fact that yes, bad things were done to me as a child and yes, those things were bad enough to be considered abuse and no, I am not delusional or manipulative or some other kind of awful monster acting with intent to harm my family.\n\nAnyway, once I no longer had to go to church people started commenting on how much healthier I looked.  Hooo boy can you bet that not a single person in my life made the connection between me leaving the cult and me gleaning some happiness out of the world.  How did I get that glow, that bounce in my step, that smile?  It\u2019s a fucking mystery, let\u2019s ask god what happened.  College hit and I finally accepted what I kind of knew all along \u2013 I have no fucking business with organized religion, I disagree with the church on every important social issue, and I legitimately think that no one has been able to demonstrate with any degree of confidence that there are such things as gods.  I also developed a passion for animal care and began applying to graduate programs where I could, without getting too technical, work with abused animals who display behavior issues like aggression towards humans because these animals were raised in unhealthy environments by humans.  It\u2019s a little clich\u00e9, I know, but I need to work with living things whose anger stems from pain because that is me all over.  I feel like they don\u2019t judge anyone for being angry at abuse because they themselves are angry at it.  I never get that feeling with humans.  They\u2019re sad for me, and if they\u2019ve suffered they\u2019re often sad for themselves as well.  But they never get so angry that they can look into the eyes of the person feeding them with such intense rage because just because someone feeds you doesn\u2019t mean they give a shit about your overall wellbeing, then proceed to attempt to scare that human (the one with the food) away.  I know that feeling.  I\u2019ve been so hurt by people that my first instinct is to scare them away first, even (dare I say especially?) if they were only attempting to provide some form of help or support.  For so long I felt like shit because I do this but I figured if I can look into the face of an animal that has a completely understandable desire to murder me and still want nothing but the best for that animal, then maybe it is possible for humans to be kind.  Maybe it is even possible for them to be kind to me.\n\nWell, after a round of rejections, some real world work experience, and a second attempt at applying, I was accepted into my dream graduate school.  Two weeks later the aforementioned apartment fire occurred, and for 3 months after I was too borderline suicidal to appreciate that I had actually accomplished something pretty fucking cool.  My parents tried to be supportive but as you may have guessed they cannot do that thing even if they try.  Also they can only keep up the attempt for a week or so so when it turned out that trauma doesn\u2019t just evaporate they threatened to have me committed.\n\nA little bit of therapy and a whole lot of apathy later and I managed to get back on civil terms with my parents and they helped me move out of state (tearfully, in my mother\u2019s case).  Now I\u2019m here, finally over a thousand miles away from the toxicity of my childhood and integrating into a world where abuse is not the norm has been almost as bad as the abuse itself.  People do not understand my preparedness to fight.  Not argue, not debate, not even get a little snippy.  Full on trial-by-combat let the Many Faced God decide who is right and who should have fucking thought before she made that snide comment if she wanted to continue living FIGHT.  My therapist said it had to do with an overactive sympathetic nervous system, essentially my family pressed caps lock on my fight or flight response then pried off the key so I can never really come back down from thinking I am in perpetual danger.  Oftentimes this means some stressed out white man says something offhand and slightly rude, but not meant as a personal attack, and if I can I freak out and threaten his life and if I am not in a position where that would be feasible I glare at him and maybe knock something over for emphasis.  Not necessarily healthy, but satisfying to know that someone who probably never had anything truly terrible happen to him knows, for at least a split second, that if he fucks with me HE DIES SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY AND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ANY LIVING RELATIVES WHO MIGHT BE ALSO CAUSED PAIN BY HIS DEATH BECAUSE FUCK HIM AND ANYONE WHO DARES THINK HE IS A WORTHWHILE HUMAN BEING BECAUSE\nWORTHWHILE\nHUMAN\nBEINGS\nDO\nNOT\nTREAT\nME\nLIKE\nMY\nPARENTS\nDID.\nA dangerous attitude since guns are easier to obtain here.  On that note, while I want a gun (mostly to defend myself against gun-rights-activists. Call it hypocrisy and I call you dead-to-me) I realize that I am probably more likely to use it on myself than on any of the other people who deserve it.\n\nAnyway.  I\u2019m here, I don\u2019t know who the fuck I am because for the past 25 years I haven\u2019t really been allowed to just BE.  I was always told my emotions were either factually or morally incorrect so now when I have a feeling it feels like air raid sirens going off and I literally have to remove myself from situations that normal, well-adjusted, societally worthwhile people can handle.  And I can\u2019t really trust anyone to care about my pain because, in the words of my pernicious half-sister \u201cNo one has to be nice to you.\u201d  Note that she said this while I was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of my car seriously contemplating revving it up to 60 and crashing into a brick wall.  Apparently this was supposed to convince me to be happy and live my life.  For some reason no one in my family realizes that I need emotional support sometimes, like when I lose all my possessions and my pets and the security of a roof over my head to a traumatic disaster such as a fire.  The worst parts of my suicidal depression were happening when I was trying to deal with insurance and the cleaning company and property management was doing everything in their power to threaten me and bully me into\u2026 what? I don\u2019t know because whenever I called to ask what exactly I need to do to get them to stop exacerbating my desire to drown myself they would ignore my calls.  How supportive was my family during this time? Well, do me a favor and dunk a loaf of wonderbread in water then see how well it supports things.\n\nAh, I should also note that the sister who told me no one has to be nice to me has also told another suicidal sister of mine to stop talking about it and just do it.  She is a schoolteacher, this psychotic, compassionless shitstain.  She is a school teacher as a backup career because she could not hack it as a counsellor or therapist.  Probably because she kept telling suicidal people who took the terrifying step of reaching out for help that if they really want to die they should just fucking do it aleady.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t trust people to care about my wellbeing because if my own family can\u2019t, why should anyone else?  Also, the fact that I need care means that I am incapable of providing it and therefore I am a drain on every social relationship I maintain.  People say I should focus on caring for myself but 1) if I am worthless why should I care about me and 2) if I do care about me, my opinion of me is worthless because I am worthless.  No amount of thinking can get me past that \u2013 from a social standpoint I am a terrible investment and while I wish someone would be my friend I honestly can\u2019t blame them for not wanting to.  I feel like I need someone to see some good in me before I can say that I have anything good in me and not have it feel like a manipulative lie I tell myself to excuse myself from the terrible effects my existence had on my family.  But because I realize that you\u2019d have to be crazy to want to help me I have a hard time trusting people who show me kindness because they are either insane or plotting something or just generally nice to everyone.  Goddamn I wish I knew how it felt to have someone be nice to me because I am simply special to them.  Not special to the world in general, I just want one single person to rank me as one of the important people in their lives.  I also can\u2019t set boundaries because my father treated boundary violation as an Olympic sport.  I don\u2019t know how I feel about hugs because while I recognize I probably need one, my father used to yell, hit me, then pull me into a crushing, painful smothering attempt he called a \u201chug\u201d and refused to let me go no matter how much I kicked, screamed, and tried to pull away.  So basically my modes are \u201cLook at me and I will gnaw your face off like I am a captive chimpanzee and you are a moron who thinks it\u2019s a good idea to get in the face of a captive chimpanzee\u201d or \u201csure, do whatever, want my kidney while you\u2019re at it?\u201d\n\nThis means that I can say terrible shit about professors to my classmates \u2013 \u201cJudging from how she refused to answer any clarifying questions on our debate prompts combined with the fact that several people have warned me she loves starting drama I think that this whole quarter was her trying to pit us against each other for her own gain and I am really glad I will never take another class with her.  Furthermore, if she is so concerned with ethics then why is she planning all this contentious bullshit in our first quarter where we need to make good impressions on each other?\u201d  Then when they say I should be ashamed for thinking that, let alone saying it, I roll over and say they\u2019re absolutely right, my perspective on the world is cruel and factually wrong if not straight-up delusional.\n\nWell one of them has taken this as permission to joke about the fact that my home burned down.  I don\u2019t know how to confront her on it without screaming at her that she had better goddamned drop out and move away if she knows what\u2019s good for her, her parents, her siblings, and anyone else who ever gave her an ounce of support or approval.  Granted, I made a couple jokes about it both as a coping mechanism for myself as I am the one who put the work into not just shriveling up and dying over the summer and as a way to introduce the topic of \u201chey I am coming down from the most traumatic experience of my adult life and I\u2019m doing a thousand miles away from the people who should have been there to support me\u201d so people understand why I\u2019m such a mess.  I guess I\u2019m just going to have to say it in those words because clearly the only people who understand that trauma is bad for a person\u2019s health are others who have been through trauma.  Which.  Wow.  If you can\u2019t understand that \u201cI lost my home and am laughing really loudly about it because the alternative is sobbing while clutching a pillow like a rejected Harry Harlow experiment\u201d then your problem isn\u2019t lack of trauma, it\u2019s lack of basic human empathy.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks.  If you skipped over most of it, understandable.  It\u2019s 10 pages single spaced after all.  I\u2019m probably going to print this out later to take to my school\u2019s counselling center because it\u2019s easier than trying to articulate this whole mess in front of a stranger.\n\nTLDR:  I was abused and neglected as a child both by my family and the church they forced me to attend 6 days a week for 9 years.  As a result I don\u2019t trust my own life experience and am pretty sure I\u2019m not worth the love and support I need to be healthy.  This has made getting away from my family and making my own way in the world extremely difficult as I cannot distinguish between a person\u2019s actual intentions and the way those intentions appear to me when filtered through the survival mechanism that has taken the place of my worldview, making me essentially just as toxic to them as my family was to me.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7h0avt", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Warning: absurdly long and probably confusing", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512187389.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7h0avt", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7h0avt/warning_absurdly_long_and_probably_confusing/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512213710.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7h0avt/warning_absurdly_long_and_probably_confusing/", "author_flair_text": "", "quarantine": false, "author": "Hoolockhoolock", "created_utc": 1512184910.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am poor and many people say that i am a lazy moocher a loser, i should jsut work harder and not complain. i Should get a good education and a good job.

i don't know what the word is. and i basically said something to myself like \"who the fuck cares, dashboard confessional\"\n\nand AGAIN i stop at the last stop sign just before my house and a different couple with their baby walks by.\n\nthen i realized that i care.\n\nthis is really cheesy sounding i guess but i realized that i don't want to DIE, but i'm having trouble living. my therapist is not the right match for me, specifically, so instead of feeling like an idiot because i feel like a trained professional can't help me, i think i'm going to ask my parents to find someone new. it's not my therapist's fault or my fault, i realized, it's just to do what's best for me i have to find someone who can really really help me\n\nyeah sorry that was long i just wanted to get that out really badly", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gwlru", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "i'm going to get better", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 6, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7gwlru", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7gwlru/im_going_to_get_better/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512178784.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7gwlru/im_going_to_get_better/", "author_flair_text": "", "quarantine": false, "author": "gigihadont", "created_utc": 1512149984.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i really want to kill myself but im too scared to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;there&amp;#39;s no reason for me to live any longer.

It&amp;#39;s all my fucking fault too. I&amp;#39;m pathetic. Just plain pathetic. I will always hate myself. I have absolutely nothing to look forward to except heaven. That&amp;#39;s my one saving grace. Maybe if I die, I&amp;#39;ll get to go to heaven and the fact that I never forgot about my relationship with Christ will finally pay off. I used to think that non-existence would be better than heaven, but maybe when I come home it won&amp;#39;t matter what I think and feel about myself anymore.

I didn&amp;#39;t know what this feeling was when I was 11 because I was (and continue to be) emotionally blunted and calloused. I learned from an early age that I am never who I think I am to other people. I was never the person I desperately wanted to be. I am forever detached from my self. I will only ever acknowledge how deep in a whole I am until I get another fucking emotional epiphany like I am now, where I really look at my life and who I am and find I&amp;#39;m utterly disgusted and dissapointed with who I am still. I hate myself, and I will have to dissociate if I am to go on like this, until again, the next epiphany comes and I realize I am utterly ashamed to be me. I am ashamed to hear my name spoken. It&amp;#39;s always just another fucking reminder that this is me. This pathetic man is me. I&amp;#39;m not allowed to be anyone else. I have to live with my utter failure at life itself. Fuck I&amp;#39;m crying now. I am beyond saving in any Earthly way. I give up on myself. Soon my body might give up on me too, regardless of what I do.

This is the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half. We met online when we were both in a really bad mental state.

I worry I jumped the gun on a relationship when I really just wanted a friend. No matter how hard I try, I just can&amp;#39;t be content with how things are. I care about my boyfriend still. I care about him so much. I just don&amp;#39;t want to be his girlfriend anymore. Ideally, I&amp;#39;d want to remain his best friend and he my best friend. But my past experience with relationships tells me that probably wont happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past year and a half our relationship has become extremely codependent. We&amp;#39;re in nearly constant contact and neither of us have a particularly large circle of friends outside of each other. I&amp;#39;ve tried addressing this with him in the past, but he doesn&amp;#39;t see a problem with how close we are. How we&amp;#39;re basically each others only friends. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to widen my circle of friends lately, and I&amp;#39;m encouraging him to do the same, but he doesn&amp;#39;t have much interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s an incredibly sweet guy. Someone I know will find other girls to be with. But he has very little self esteem and doesn&amp;#39;t get out much. There was a point in our relationship where anxiety and depression really hit him hard. I did all I could to be there for him, support him, help him get through the battle he was fighting, and luckily he did. Over the course of a few months he was back to his normal self. I worry a lot about what would have happened if I wasnt there for him those few months. He has a history with depression and he hasn&amp;#39;t really developed the ability to talk with people about it. It&amp;#39;s a rough situation, because when he&amp;#39;s feeling good, he doesn&amp;#39;t feel the need to have a support network, but when he&amp;#39;s feeling bad, he doesn&amp;#39;t have the motivation to get help. He&amp;#39;s a great guy, but incredibly stubborn. Basically since we met I&amp;#39;ve been trying to convince him to see a therapist, have one on standby in case he gets bad, or at least talk with his family about therapy. But I can&amp;#39;t get him to budge or do anything and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do to help him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a point in our relationship where we did break up. For about a month. I hate to say it, but I was happier during that month than the last several of our relationship. But my boyfriend was miserable. I don&amp;#39;t want to go over all the details, but my breaking up with him and the sadness from it consumed his life. He talked multiple times about self harm and suicide. There were a handful of nights where I was really worried he&amp;#39;d try something and it terrified me. I was scared he&amp;#39;d hurt himself and I&amp;#39;d lose my best friend forever. This fear and some loneliness of my own drove me to get back together with him. I know that was a bad decision. That it was stupid and undid any progress I&amp;#39;d made, but I was just so scared he&amp;#39;d hurt himself. I tried to encourage him to see a therapist, and when he got bad, check himself into a hospital, but he&amp;#39;d never listen. I really didn&amp;#39;t have any control over the situation. It was the only thing I could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with our relationship or my life now. I fucked up and I&amp;#39;m too scared of losing my best friend to even begin to fix it. Please, I need help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I don&amp;#39;t want to be in a relationship with my BF anymore, but I have reason to worry he&amp;#39;ll hurt or kill himself if we break up and I don&amp;#39;t know how to help him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I tried posting this on /r/relationships, but they told me to post it here.

I don&amp;#39;t want that. I want love. I want appreciation. I want people to recognize me. I want to be loved. I want to be perfect for everybody. I want to stop feeling guilty. And with all of this white noise originating from people&amp;#39;s mouths, I can&amp;#39;t hear myself and I can&amp;#39;t hear my desire to live anymore. I&amp;#39;m not happy.

It&amp;#39;s more of a fake smile. I heard people saying that if you do fake smile it will actually make you happy. Doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it. No matter how hard I try it&amp;#39;s just a short term solution, which doesn&amp;#39;t make me feel any better. \nI still look for something inside myself. I still look for some parts of me that are functioning wrongly because it is my fault and I am the one to blame. I am not good enough. I am not trying hard enough. I am way to lazy. I am the one to talk. I surrounded myself with sand castles which are my dreams and hopes and there is a tide and a wind that are going to destroy everything I built. All of this makes me feel like I am unworthy. I mean, I know I am unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did I do wrong? Where am I going?

It hurts when I enjoy the lake near my apartment. And it is not my body that hurts. It is not my soul because I do not believe in such thing. But somewhere deep inside my head, my skull, my brain.

But this is the worst that it&amp;#39;s been in a long time. Out of nowhere things got really bad, and last Saturday night I found myself 8 stories up on top of a parking deck, looking down.

All day today I thought about going back to that parking deck and just doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought about going back to a mental health facility in my area. I&amp;#39;ve stayed there twice. There are more than a few things keeping me from going there though..\nI don&amp;#39;t have health insurance. My dad lost his job a few weeks ago, and with that my family lost all of our health benefits. There&amp;#39;s no way I could afford to pay for a hospital on my own. My family might be willing to help but I don&amp;#39;t want to put that on them.\nI would also be labeled an addict and forced to go through a recovery program. I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. It really helps me with my depression, anxiety, mood swings, paranoia, etc... Just because I would test positive means that they&amp;#39;d make me focus on my &amp;quot;addiction&amp;quot; problem and push my other mental health problems to the side. I&amp;#39;ve seen it happen to people in there, and they leave without getting any real help that they need.\nI also stopped taking my medication a few months ago. Stopped seeing my psychiatrist and therapist, all of that. I&amp;#39;m tired of having to rely on medication to function like a normal person, to be able to feel happy. I&amp;#39;m open to medication options, if I could find any that would actually work. And that&amp;#39;s without even considering the cost of a psychiatrist and medication, and at the hospital they&amp;#39;d force medication down my throat and add that to the list of bills.. Anyways. Going to the hospital or going back to a therapist or psychiatrist or whatever doctor isn&amp;#39;t an option anymore since I don&amp;#39;t have health insurance. Can&amp;#39;t afford it.

I don't really live for anything or anyone and I'd die for less. I have this heart that wants to give SO much, but it's slipping. I feel like everyday I hold on is a waste. Even when I'm happy, I'm often thinking - \"This would be a really great day to off myself.\" It's weird. \n\nThis is one of those... I'm analysing everything I am, that I've said or done recently and in the past, worrying about how things land... \n\nAnd I know... that this will pass, even if it does get me one day.

Via bleeding to death in a bathtub. If a miracle happens at the concert I\u2019ll be seeing before I\u2019ll commit suicide, let\u2019s say I make a new circle of friends or even meet a girl which is interested in me, I\u2019ll maybe think about it. But all in all,- I just want to leave this fucking planet once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last few months my life has made a few heavy and impactful unexpected turns. A brief overview,- I\u2019m your usual 18 year old outsider who sucks at socialising and isn\u2019t good with girls. Currently I\u2019m attending commercial high school and will graduate in 1 \u00bd years. I think about suicide, killing others and dying in general daily and cried out for help multiple times,- I wasn\u2019t heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing that got me to spiral down into what I believe is not depression but just utter solitude, anger, angst, fear and sadness are my parents. One day, we\u2019re the perfect family, no not the other day, the other 364 days a year it\u2019s a fucking shithole. I quit ice hockey because I grew tired of it. Parents take the absolute piss. I dyed my hair black and bleach-blonde half a year later and tried various styles out. I get yelled at, my dad ignored me and just despised me for that time. I see myself slipping in high school and what do I get? Support? Comfort? Hell no, I get yelled at, made fun of and get told that I\u2019m an absolute idiot and a failure. By my own fucking parents. The perfect parent-son relationship, right? The fact that my sister who\u2019s three years older than me and basically did everything right in her life and is now the poster child doesn\u2019t make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fasten your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen, here\u2019s the next part of why I want to fucking kill myself. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend or even something remotely close to that. I tried dating and actually met a few decent girls, one of which I almost started a relationship with,- but then found out that she was just mentally abusing me to get me to buy her things and serve as an attention-giver. Great. Since then I couldn\u2019t function properly anymore in terms of talking to people. I\u2019ve got the feeling that whatever I say or express,- they just\u2026do not really care. I feel ugly, mentally and physically even though I know it\u2019s not true. The few friends I have tell me I\u2019m decent looking. I don\u2019t hate my looks either but it just feels like that everyone I don\u2019t know, especially girls and women think that I\u2019m not attractive at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this,- you might wonder: \u201cWell everyone goes through this.\u201d That might be true. But people recover from it. I\u2026absolutely didn\u2019t. The incident with the girl who emotionally and mentally abused me now lies 2 and a half years back and it\u2019s still holding me down. I still think about that person almost daily and how I could\u2019ve probably reached a happy ending in that part of my life. I haven\u2019t had a circle of good friends for four years now. The people in which I take interest in seem to not even care that I seem interested. E.G. that one time at a comic con, one of the few social gatherings I actually do attend because I\u2019m a huge bloody nerd, I casually talked to a, in my eyes, cute girl. We had conversations about various comics, video games and movies. When we were to say goodbye, I asked for her number. She just gave me a weird look, shook her head while cringing and said \u201c\u2026nooo.\u201d and walked away. In my head I was like \u201cHey, alright\u2026I guess I\u2019ll just go fuck myself then?\u201d swiftly looked through everything, bought what I wanted and headed home again.

Just rock out, drink, smoke and have a blast,- basically going out with a bang. Maybe I\u2019ll meet people there, maybe even a nice girl. But at this point I don\u2019t even care. Maybe I do.

That all the hassle, that pain and the regret is at an end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "TLDR at the beginning because fuck me that text is way longer than I expected it to be; I\u2019m probably going to kill myself tomorrow night. Via bleeding to death in a bathtub. If a miracle happens at the concert I\u2019ll be seeing before I\u2019ll commit suicide, let\u2019s say I make a new circle of friends or even meet a girl which is interested in me, I\u2019ll maybe think about it. But all in all,- I just want to leave this fucking planet once and for all.\n\nOver the course of the last few months my life has made a few heavy and impactful unexpected turns. A brief overview,- I\u2019m your usual 18 year old outsider who sucks at socialising and isn\u2019t good with girls. Currently I\u2019m attending commercial high school and will graduate in 1 \u00bd years. I think about suicide, killing others and dying in general daily and cried out for help multiple times,- I wasn\u2019t heard.\n\nThe first thing that got me to spiral down into what I believe is not depression but just utter solitude, anger, angst, fear and sadness are my parents. One day, we\u2019re the perfect family, no not the other day, the other 364 days a year it\u2019s a fucking shithole. I quit ice hockey because I grew tired of it. Parents take the absolute piss. I dyed my hair black and bleach-blonde half a year later and tried various styles out. I get yelled at, my dad ignored me and just despised me for that time. I see myself slipping in high school and what do I get? Support? Comfort? Hell no, I get yelled at, made fun of and get told that I\u2019m an absolute idiot and a failure. By my own fucking parents. The perfect parent-son relationship, right? The fact that my sister who\u2019s three years older than me and basically did everything right in her life and is now the poster child doesn\u2019t make it any better.\n\nFasten your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen, here\u2019s the next part of why I want to fucking kill myself. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend or even something remotely close to that. I tried dating and actually met a few decent girls, one of which I almost started a relationship with,- but then found out that she was just mentally abusing me to get me to buy her things and serve as an attention-giver. Great. Since then I couldn\u2019t function properly anymore in terms of talking to people. I\u2019ve got the feeling that whatever I say or express,- they just\u2026do not really care. I feel ugly, mentally and physically even though I know it\u2019s not true. The few friends I have tell me I\u2019m decent looking. I don\u2019t hate my looks either but it just feels like that everyone I don\u2019t know, especially girls and women think that I\u2019m not attractive at all. \n\nAll of this,- you might wonder: \u201cWell everyone goes through this.\u201d That might be true. But people recover from it. I\u2026absolutely didn\u2019t. The incident with the girl who emotionally and mentally abused me now lies 2 and a half years back and it\u2019s still holding me down. I still think about that person almost daily and how I could\u2019ve probably reached a happy ending in that part of my life. I haven\u2019t had a circle of good friends for four years now. The people in which I take interest in seem to not even care that I seem interested. E.G. that one time at a comic con, one of the few social gatherings I actually do attend because I\u2019m a huge bloody nerd, I casually talked to a, in my eyes, cute girl. We had conversations about various comics, video games and movies. When we were to say goodbye, I asked for her number. She just gave me a weird look, shook her head while cringing and said \u201c\u2026nooo.\u201d and walked away. In my head I was like \u201cHey, alright\u2026I guess I\u2019ll just go fuck myself then?\u201d swiftly looked through everything, bought what I wanted and headed home again. Could\u2019ve been a cool day but that incident was just enough for me to assume that I\u2019m a failure of mankind that can\u2019t even socialise properly.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m an alien from another planet. I can\u2019t seem to fit in, not even in my sort of thing which would be the alternative, grunge and rock genre of people. I can\u2019t seem to get accepted for what I am by my own parents. I\u2019m literally unable to initiate a relationship, and fuck me I crave one so bad. I\u2019ll probably end up dropping out of high school because I can\u2019t focus on school.

I told him that I once told my [current] boyfriend that I loved him but that he didn&amp;#39;t say that he loved me back. He told me that he was once in a relationship with a girl and the same thing happened, and that it made him lose interest in her, sort of insinuating that that same thing might happen to me. He was trying to give me advice, I guess. I started crying. He didn&amp;#39;t exactly know that I would have reacted the way I did, but then again that isn&amp;#39;t really the type of thing you say to someone if you&amp;#39;re trying to help them with something. I told him that I needed some time alone and hung up.\nNow, I have a problem with being confident in relationships.

The guy I&amp;#39;m dating now is a total sweetheart and we&amp;#39;ve been dating for almost 9 months now, but in the beginning of the relationship I was really scared about losing him because I can get really emotional at times. A month or so ago I finally started to feel more confident about this relationship because it&amp;#39;s lasted so long.\nSo, after I hung up on my friend (and went to sleep, because it was night time), he sent me a bunch of messages saying that he was sorry, he didn&amp;#39;t mean it, etc. I know that he didn&amp;#39;t mean to hurt me, even though he didn&amp;#39;t use the best advice. When I woke up, I told him that I would talk to him for a few days because I was angry about what he said, but that he shouldn&amp;#39;t be afraid of losing me as a friend. I just needed some time to &amp;quot;recuperate,&amp;quot; essentially. Last night he messaged me again, saying that he was &amp;#39;leaving,&amp;quot; and that he was sorry. From talking to him before when he was like this I knew that he meant that he was going to kill himself. Then he blocked me and deactivated his account before I could reply.\nNot too long ago, he activated his account I guess, because he started talking to me again. He said that the way he said goodbye last night wasn&amp;#39;t the proper way to go. Then he sent a few long messages that all boiled down to him not wanting to need people anymore when they didn&amp;#39;t need him. He said that hurting me was essentially the tipping point. Then he blocked me again, and hasn&amp;#39;t talked to me since.\nIf my reaction to what he said was his tipping point, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll ever be able to forgive myself. On the other hand, what he said really did hurt me. It&amp;#39;s going to take everything in me to convince myself that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be my fault if he killed himself, and even then I don&amp;#39;t know if it will be enough.

But because I&amp;#39;m a teenage girl everyone thinks it&amp;#39;s just teenage angst, but it&amp;#39;s so much more than that. It&amp;#39;s not my parents, just my dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I love my mom a lot more than most teenagers. I&amp;#39;m fifteen and when I can&amp;#39;t sleep or I have a nightmare, I&amp;#39;ll go sleep in her bed like a child would. I&amp;#39;ve always loved her like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve always hated my dad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My earliest memory is when my brother was five and I was eight. It was the first time we had to see our dad since the divorce. My brother was sobbing because he didn&amp;#39;t want to go. I didn&amp;#39;t want to go either, but my mom said I had to be strong for him and she had me convince him it was going to be okay. We&amp;#39;ve both always hated him and the only way I could get him to stop crying was to say we were going to a toy store. I still feel so guilty about lying to him like that. He doesn&amp;#39;t even remember it, but I just feel like such a terrible sibling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish our dad was a decent human being. My entire life I&amp;#39;ve had to be strong for my brother when we went. He would always sob and meltdown, and I felt the same way. But I couldn&amp;#39;t cry because I had to be happy and try to make it as good as I could for my brother. I love my brother and I would do anything for him, but I&amp;#39;m just so done with everything. I&amp;#39;ve been strong for so long and I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore. My dad is so awful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything I&amp;#39;ve ever been interested in, he&amp;#39;s ruined for me. As soon as I could read and write, I&amp;#39;d write long stories. I had a spiral notebook I would write in. I would write pages of fantasy stories, but I would also occasionally write about something in my life if it was bothering me. I think I was twelve when it happened. I was feeling kind of suicidal. I wasn&amp;#39;t planning it or anything, I was just very frustrated with several things in my life.  So I wrote a story about a girl who kills herself. I wrote it, felt better, and didn&amp;#39;t think of it again. I went to my dad&amp;#39;s for the weekend. When I came back, my mom sat me down. She told me my dad had read my notebook and insisted that I was depressed and I was going to kill myself. My mom understood that it was just a story and she didn&amp;#39;t make a big deal out of it. But I just felt so betrayed. I stopped writing in my notebook because I didn&amp;#39;t want him reading anything. I started to be depressed and actually considered suicide because my only coping mechanism was taken away from me and I didn&amp;#39;t want to open up to the parents that ruined it for me. It wasn&amp;#39;t my mom&amp;#39;s fault, she&amp;#39;s always completely respected my privacy, but at the time I was upset with both of them. That Christmas I asked for one of those fancy journal things with the lock and the secret compartment. My mom got it for me. I chose a four digit pin I would remember, and if the code was entered wrong, it had a voice say something about trying again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This worked out for a while. His house was small, so my brother and I would sleep in sleeping bags on the living room floor. One night I got woken up by the voice on the diary. I looked over, and my dad was trying to guess the password. I pretended to still be asleep, but I think he realized I was awake because he went to his room after that. The thing that kept the diary closed was pretty much just a piece of cardboard. I figured that he would cut open the diary. So when I had a few minutes alone at my mom&amp;#39;s house, I tore out every page I had written on. I put them in the bathtub. My mom loves candles, so it was easy to find a lighter. I burned the pages and rinsed the ashes down the drain. Even though the diary didn&amp;#39;t have anything else written in it, I buried it in the woods behind our backyard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped writing. I hardly did anything during this time. I barely remember the next couple years, so let&amp;#39;s skip to this year. I was having problems with school. My mom has ADD, and she saw a lot of the symptoms in me and wanted to get me tested. My dad was very against it, he said I was just lazy and my mom needed to discipline me better. My mom didn&amp;#39;t care what he said and got me tested anyways, and yup, I have ADD. They recommended meds, and my dad was very against it. My mom wants what&amp;#39;s best for me, so she got me the meds and just didn&amp;#39;t tell him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was over the summer. Fall comes, and I start at a new school. My old school didn&amp;#39;t offer journalism, and this one does, and I joined. So I was finally back into writing. I loved it and would talk about it at any chance I got. What did my dad say about my new hobby? &amp;quot;Journalism is a dying industry. Enjoy it as a hobby, but don&amp;#39;t focus on it. You&amp;#39;ll never make any money with it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know how wrong that is, but it still hurt. Aren&amp;#39;t your parents supposed to encourage you and tell you you can be anything? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s also a firm believer in gender roles.  Whenever we visit, we have to do chores right away which is stupid enough on its own. You don&amp;#39;t get to see us often, and when you do you make us do chores? I would think he&amp;#39;d like to spend time with us. We&amp;#39;re always given the same types of chores. I have to stay inside and do the dishes and laundry. My brother has to do all the outside work. Something my brother is very passionate about is cooking. He&amp;#39;ll spend hours creating elaborate meals. My dad refuses to acknowledge this. If my brother starts talking about anything cooking related, he&amp;#39;ll change the subject right away. I want to be a firefighter when I grow up, but I won&amp;#39;t mention anything about it to him, because I know he&amp;#39;ll just discourage me. He constantly talks about how if I get a boyfriend, he&amp;#39;ll have to know how to fix cars and play football. He&amp;#39;d probably have a heart attack if he knew I was a lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple months pass. My sister (eight years older than me and has a different dad who wants nothing to do with her) was pregnant. At 25 weeks something went wrong, and she had an emergency c section. The baby didn&amp;#39;t make it. His name was Brookston. We were all so excited for him. I don&amp;#39;t really like human babies very much, but it was my very first nephew and I realized I was actually pretty excited to be an aunt. I missed a lot of school because it was obviously very upsetting. My mom started me with a therapist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few visits, the therapist said he thinks I&amp;#39;m on the autism spectrum. At first I didn&amp;#39;t believe it, but after doing some research, it made complete sense. My mom wanted to get me officially tested for it, mainly so I could get additional help in school. Not special ed, stuff like being able to have a weighted blanket (my mom works with mentally disabled adults, and they had an extra weighted blanket that my mom brought home for me after what my therapist said) and get extra time for assignments in subjects I struggle in. My dad refuses to accept it and won&amp;#39;t let me get tested. My mom can&amp;#39;t do it anyways this time because now I&amp;#39;m under his insurance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even sure what finally broke me, but I started melting down any time I had to visit with him. My psychiatrist said that so much had happened and that I just needed time to adjust, and to avoid further stress for a couple weeks. She said I needed to stop visits with my dad until I felt better. My mom told him that, and he flipped out on her. He said he won&amp;#39;t pay child support if he doesn&amp;#39;t get to see us. The next day I come out of school to walk home, like always. But his car is there and I end up spending the night at his house. He always springs visits on me last minute. One Saturday I had plans with someone, which is very rare for me. In the past he&amp;#39;s complained about how antisocial I am. But Friday night he says to me &amp;quot;Do you have plans tomorrow night? Because now you do!&amp;quot; His plans for me were to go to a fucking bible study. I&amp;#39;m an atheist, and he continues to force me to go to religious functions despite what I say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep having to visit with him and I&amp;#39;m so fucking tired of having to put up with a man that doesn&amp;#39;t respect my mental health or interests. I feel unsafe at his house because he never locks his doors and keeps several guns under his bed, unlocked. But now I&amp;#39;m starting to think that&amp;#39;s a good thing. Dying would be much better than having to put up with him. I don&amp;#39;t want to leave my brother alone, but hopefully his daughter killing herself would be enough of a wake up call. If he&amp;#39;s awful enough to not change after that, they could probably go to court and give my mom full custody. I have three years until I&amp;#39;m eighteen and I would never have to see him again. But that would mean my brother would be there all alone for three yeard and I can&amp;#39;t do that to him, but I can&amp;#39;t put up with this for another six years. I&amp;#39;m thinking next visit will be my last.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have hated my dad as long as I can remember.

But that would mean my brother would be there all alone for three yeard and I can't do that to him, but I can't put up with this for another six years.

I already went to college-- to a shit one, and got shit grades at it. And I&amp;#39;m too old and in too much debt to try to go back. They wouldn&amp;#39;t want me even if I weren&amp;#39;t in debt. I don&amp;#39;t have anything I want to study in particular anyway. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I can&amp;#39;t fall in love. I don&amp;#39;t know why, but I just can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m attractive enough, I think, and a young girl. I can make people laugh. I can talk to people and say all the right things, but no one is interested in me. Its like they can smell it on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep trying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every year it&amp;#39;s the same thing: I destroy my life somehow (quit my job, alienate my friends, get drunk and make an ass of myself so badly I can&amp;#39;t show my face around my old haunts anymore), and then I move somewhere even farther away, and I try again. Every time I&amp;#39;ve convinced myself that things will get better. I convince myself I&amp;#39;m making progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I just destroyed everything again. Or, rather, I&amp;#39;m on the edge of destroying it. I had a massive breakdown yesterday-- the whole works. Crying in public, screaming at strangers, texting everyone I ever knew to either tell them humiliating things about myself or to try and hurt their feelings, just to prove that I could. It happens every year, and is usually followed by me quitting and moving.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only problem is, this time I have no where to go once its done. I&amp;#39;m already as far away as I can get, and I don&amp;#39;t have the money or the resources to leave again. I have no where to go this time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, I realized, I can just kill myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a plan. I have the tools for it too. They&amp;#39;re sitting on a shelf next to my good luck charms and my old stuffed animal from when I was a kid. I have more than enough to do the trick.

But I don&amp;#39;t think I need a note. Maybe this is a note. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have these other sides of me that I project into actual people to talk to, because I&amp;#39;m lonely, and because it helps me think.

It helps me realize when I&amp;#39;m being vain, or selfish, or immature, because they&amp;#39;re separate personifications. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a new one now, that&amp;#39;s been there since yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It keeps telling me to do it. Anytime for the past 24 hours when I go to do anything, it&amp;#39;s saying &amp;quot;how about now&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s telling me the logic behind it.

It&amp;#39;s telling me that this is finally my chance to go through with something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a plan. And I have the materials. And I have the reasoning, and I&amp;#39;m trapped, and I have no where else to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not an idiot.

I do exercise because I am on a sports team. I barely sleep anymore not because of insomnia, but because I have &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; to do that I should have finished during the day.

After I wrote this, I went through with my attempt. I called 911 on twhile I was driving on a highway and they alerted a cop who was on his way home. I was pushing 100 swerving in and out of traffic. As soon as I saw his lights come on I crossed the center median into oncomming traffic trying to hit a semi. I lost control of my vehicle and rolled twice into a ditch, through a fence on the other side of the road. Apparently, there was a dead deer laying their and its antlers prevented the vehicle from rolling any further.I dont know how I got out and I walked over to the cop with my hands held high. He sat me down and talked with me and shortly there after I was transported by ambulance to the nearest hospital. I saw my vehicle and their was such a small chance of me surving, the passenger would have been dead. When I can Ill upload a picture. I was then transported by helicopter to a different hospital to be looked at. I had no major injuries except a small gash on the left side of my head and a possible mild concussion I still need to get looked at for. The accident happened Wednesday morning and Thursday night i was moved to a medical center for troubled teens where i had therapy sessions and counceling for suicide, depression and to develop coping skills. I was released about 4 hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit** Thankyou for all the comments. It feels nice knowing that so many people care. I love you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Mom and dad if your reading this, thankyou dad for always being caring and understanding. Thankyou for introducing me to movies and music and for talking with me whenever I needed to. Mom, in my last thoughts, you never really lived up to much. I don't think you were made to be a parent. Clay thanks for being a good young brother, don't do what I did. I'm mentally ill and just want to escape from it all. All my grandparents, but especially Nana and Papa, thankyou for being great grandparents and always knowing how to make us happy.\n\nMy friends and teammates, good luck in your lives wherever you go and I hope it goes well.\n\nDeric and Seth, my closest friends, thankyou for always being their for me. You guys are the best friends I could've asked for and I wish I had more to say.\n\nMark, my counseler, I haven't known you long and I know I was always awkward talking with you, please continue wirh what you are doing. Your great at your job.\n\nEverybody else I didn't mention, the police or detectives reading this as my last note, I've hid alot of stuff in my life, stuff that would get me in a lot of trouble. Please don't see that as the only thing I've done. I'm a really complicated person with a twisted perception on reality now. It would take a miracle to stop me.\n\nTo all the people who have treated me bad in my life, fuck you all. We're all just a speck in the universe anyways. \n\nI'm gonna go out smilling with tears in my eyes. I'm scared and excited, I don't really know what's come over me.

Like, Jesus fucking Christ, ordering a goddamn burrito?? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Broke down and talked to my parent once, and got taken to see a doctor. Got a Zoloft prescription and saw an unhelpful therapist a few times before quitting. The stress of doctors got to me and I lied my way through it and said the pills were working fine. I never felt any different. Eventually saw a different doctor and got switched to Lexapro, but I did the same thing as before. The multiple check-ins drained me and I just wanted to suffer alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a young kid in school I was always told I was smart, one of the brightest, I could go far with my brain. But I&amp;#39;m so lazy, and tired. I nearly flunked senior year in highschool, I&amp;#39;m failing my first semester of college because I&amp;#39;m a laxy piece of shit who doesn&amp;#39;t do their work, and definitely losing the scholarship that got me there.

Got a Zoloft prescription and saw an unhelpful therapist a few times before quitting. The stress of doctors got to me and I lied my way through it and said the pills were working fine. I never felt any different. Eventually saw a different doctor and got switched to Lexapro, but I did the same thing as before.
