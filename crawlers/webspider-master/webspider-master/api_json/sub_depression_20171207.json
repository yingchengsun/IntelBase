Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don&amp;#39;t just assume a person&amp;#39;s in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told &amp;quot;just call 116 123, that&amp;#39;ll work everywhere&amp;quot; meaning everywhere in the European Union. There&amp;#39;s a global directory in the &lt;a href=\"/r/SuicideWatch\"&gt;/r/SuicideWatch&lt;/a&gt; sidebar, which is also linked here, and that&amp;#39;s the best link to offer someone whose location you don&amp;#39;t know.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone&amp;#39;s confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit&amp;#39;s admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking &amp;quot;report&amp;quot;.

I did SO MUCH to get myself to a stable point, and now this stupid depression wants to drag me back down and take me out. \n\nI've also lost my concentration on the CBT I've been working through. The first variable in each question regarding whichever hypothetical position I'm put in puts a hole in my stomach each time instead of doing what it's supposed to and change my feelings over. It makes me feel physically sick to think back to my days of being bullied or the long depressing nights I had.\n\nThis is maybe the most miserable I've ever felt while sober. I'm off of work until Saturday night so I have another two days of zero on my plate. And instead of reading and preparing for it, I'm here trying to sleep it off all day to no avail.\n\nThis sucks.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ia2j1", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Laying here in bed...", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7ia2j1", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7ia2j1/laying_here_in_bed/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512713901.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ia2j1/laying_here_in_bed/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "andrewdman48", "created_utc": 1512685101.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because instead of going to sleep and having a nightmare, I wake up into one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Because instead of going to sleep and having a nightmare, I wake up into one.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i4jk1", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I wish I could sleep forever.

How\u2019s everyone doing? I just thought I\u2019d try to step out of my comfort zone and type down how I\u2019ve been feeling. I hope someone can understand. I apologize in advance for my negativity/cynicism. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so lost, so weightless. Each morning I wake up, I feel a blanket of guilt overwhelm me. It\u2019s suffocating and I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. My family, has been more supportive than I thought they would be. They always ask me how I\u2019m feeling, and if I want to talk. I never really do, because I don\u2019t really know how to describe how I feel. My mom scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist a couple months ago. I was prescribed some medication which I make sure to take daily. It seemed to be working, but I feel like I\u2019ve regressed the last couple of weeks. I still feel so hopeless, so alone. I\u2019d give anything to know what I\u2019m supposed to do on this Earth. I find myself asking why I even wake up each morning. This week has been the worst. I\u2019ve left early from work each day, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate. In my head, I keep hearing a voice that constantly berates me, and makes me overthink everything.

I just thought I\u2019d try to step out of my comfort zone and type down how I\u2019ve been feeling. I hope someone can understand. I apologize in advance for my negativity/cynicism. Here we go.\n\nI feel so lost, so weightless. Each morning I wake up, I feel a blanket of guilt overwhelm me. It\u2019s suffocating and I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. My family, has been more supportive than I thought they would be. They always ask me how I\u2019m feeling, and if I want to talk. I never really do, because I don\u2019t really know how to describe how I feel. My mom scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist a couple months ago. I was prescribed some medication which I make sure to take daily. It seemed to be working, but I feel like I\u2019ve regressed the last couple of weeks. I still feel so hopeless, so alone. I\u2019d give anything to know what I\u2019m supposed to do on this Earth. I find myself asking why I even wake up each morning. This week has been the worst. I\u2019ve left early from work each day, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate. In my head, I keep hearing a voice that constantly berates me, and makes me overthink everything.

But I also can&amp;#39;t spend another year trying to be a real adult, because I hated every moment of that, too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, like, what would I do if I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I had obligations to be an adult, or whatever? A large part of my depression and anxiety comes from feeling like a failure, and being too embarrassed to talk to people because I feel fat/ugly/lazy/unworthy. So I&amp;#39;ve spent the last week trying to think of what I would do if I didn&amp;#39;t care about other&amp;#39;s opinions, and just did what I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is I would lie around all day and wish to die. In fact, if I didn&amp;#39;t care about how people felt, I probably would kill myself. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy anything. Even if the social anxiety went away, I would still feel this way because I have zero drive, ambition, goals, etc. I have no interest in living. I have tried therapy and medication, and like I said, I spent all of 2016 trying in earnest to recover via &amp;quot;getting involved,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;making healthy lifestyle choices,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;investing in my education,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;taking pride in my appearance.&amp;quot; Nothing helps. I give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t you hate when motivational exercises just make you more depressed and hopeless? I feel like such a useless piece of shit. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know how people hold it together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think of all those people in like Syria, how everyone they know and love are being bombed, how they&amp;#39;re living in refugee camps indefinitely, how they&amp;#39;re escaping their hellhole civil-war-ravaged motherland only to find persecution when they try to flee. I think about the people living in Juarez, and how seeing mutilated bodies is a daily occurrence. I think about my peers struggling to get by every day, trying to pay off student loans and health insurance premiums and rent, and how slim their prospects of ever achieving financial independence are. How do any of them keep going? Why? It doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. I admire the shit out of them. Even seeing normal people go about their days is as incredible to me as an elite athlete breaking world records. It seems almost superhuman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably have one of the best lives in human history, materially speaking. I have no excuses to fail this hard. I don&amp;#39;t know if I think that makes me a spoiled, lazy, awful, waste-of-life human, or if it means there&amp;#39;s some fatal flaw coded into my DNA and my utter inadequacy was predetermined the moment I was conceived. Maybe there&amp;#39;s no difference. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I am subhuman.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I keep asking myself this in an attempt to find a direction.

But I also can't spend another year trying to be a real adult, because I hated every moment of that, too. \n\nSo, like, what would I do if I didn't feel like I had obligations to be an adult, or whatever? A large part of my depression and anxiety comes from feeling like a failure, and being too embarrassed to talk to people because I feel fat/ugly/lazy/unworthy. So I've spent the last week trying to think of what I would do if I didn't care about other's opinions, and just did what I wanted to. \n\nThe answer is I would lie around all day and wish to die. In fact, if I didn't care about how people felt, I probably would kill myself. I don't enjoy anything. Even if the social anxiety went away, I would still feel this way because I have zero drive, ambition, goals, etc. I have no interest in living. I have tried therapy and medication, and like I said, I spent all of 2016 trying in earnest to recover via \"getting involved,\" \"making healthy lifestyle choices,\" \"investing in my education,\" \"taking pride in my appearance.\" Nothing helps. I give up.\n\nDon't you hate when motivational exercises just make you more depressed and hopeless? I feel like such a useless piece of shit. I honestly don't know how people hold it together.\n\n I think of all those people in like Syria, how everyone they know and love are being bombed, how they're living in refugee camps indefinitely, how they're escaping their hellhole civil-war-ravaged motherland only to find persecution when they try to flee. I think about the people living in Juarez, and how seeing mutilated bodies is a daily occurrence. I think about my peers struggling to get by every day, trying to pay off student loans and health insurance premiums and rent, and how slim their prospects of ever achieving financial independence are. How do any of them keep going? Why? It doesn't make sense to me. I admire the shit out of them. Even seeing normal people go about their days is as incredible to me as an elite athlete breaking world records. It seems almost superhuman. \n\n\nI probably have one of the best lives in human history, materially speaking. I have no excuses to fail this hard. I don't know if I think that makes me a spoiled, lazy, awful, waste-of-life human, or if it means there's some fatal flaw coded into my DNA and my utter inadequacy was predetermined the moment I was conceived. Maybe there's no difference. \n\nTLDR: I am subhuman.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7iau25", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "What would I do if other people's opinions had no sway over me?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": true, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7iau25", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7iau25/what_would_i_do_if_other_peoples_opinions_had_no/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512720777.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7iau25/what_would_i_do_if_other_peoples_opinions_had_no/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "NavicularOilcan", "created_utc": 1512691977.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can really only enjoy music I can relate to, I can\u2019t find any good playlists so far.

I have a HUGE LONG STORY but I\u2019m going to keep it as short as possible. So I dated this guy for about a year. It was an LDR. He is from Europe and I from America. This guy discovers not long into the relationship that I was struggling with some depression. He spends the entire rest of our relationship trying to fix it, or me, or whatever. Basically he tried to at least control it. We were OK enough to the point where he wanted to meet me. At this point with me things kind of fell out with me because 1. We argued more and more about the depression. He actually claimed it would be easier to handle if we could just meet. And 2. to be quite frank with you I don\u2019t think it was a safe or a smart decision for an 18 year old girl who has never left Home to fly on a plan for the first time to meet someone she\u2019s never met, alone. I had to tell my mom. My mother was very worried for obvious reasons and kept a lock down on me and wouldn\u2019t let me go. Which I was most definitely OK with. I know that you should take risks in life but with us not really heading in the most candy-land based direction with constant arguments about how I was depressed and not doing things correctly I just was so uninterested. It felt like he just wanted to change me. I didn\u2019t like him anymore. Wasn\u2019t attracted anymore. I felt I was being held down and I was just about to go onto college, so I took the opportunity of not flying off on this trip to erase him from my life. I stoped talking to him. He went on the trip anyway despite my warning to him that I could not go. This is harsh, I know. But I was already trying to tell him that I was not interested anymore. Again he was just assuming the depression in me was just pushing away help. The way I saw it, us meeting was far more work than I thought being with someone else could be. And that I could be much happier with someone else. I was terrified by the thought of flying somewhere by myself and being with someone that I no longer trusted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a year later, I am a sophomore in college. I have had a boyfriend for a couple months. I decide to try to clear things up and fix things. I want to apologize to Europe boy and tell him that what I did to him was really shitty. I message him. I tell him that I want a natural no-stress conversation (I was quite traumatized by his attempts to \u201csnap\u201d the depression out of me. He would get mad and threaten to post my photos and my name and address everywhere.. and he still does to this day.). He says ok. I also tell him that I messaged to be able to make things right again and give us piece of mind. I tell him that I was also starting to get a little busy due to finals. He knows that school is about the most important thing to me at this point in time of my life. He still gets mad at me to this day for \u201cstalling\u201d. Perhaps I am, but I procrastinate anyway, and as previously stated my exams are top priority. I understand that I should have waited until I had more free time to message him. He still claims I am depressed (I may be uninformed but yes I do have depression but there are times when it gets worse and better, and other than last month I feel pretty damn good about my life). He still wants me to talk to him to make things right again. Like full talking again. But it has to be done a certain way. And there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t stand more than this guy telling me that what I think about myself is wrong. For example, he is telling me that I am in denial, even though I do tell him that I realize that I have depression, I just don\u2019t feel depressed at the time. I mean, do we ever even fully overcome depression? Is that possible? Idk. I\u2019m pretty happy dealing with it and having my new boyfriend by my side. ANYWAY. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about a month more, I am literally in love. I have never loved someone more. Our relationship is so perfect. I message Europe boy again. (November was a bad month for me so little to no communication.. my dog passed away and my grandmas cancer no longer shrinking..) I tell him that I need to tell him this information (about my being in Love) now, because he still carries on as if he can still \u201cfix\u201d my depression. And sort of leads on that that means a future together. And I do not want him to think that I still want to be with him. He refused to let me tell him the information. I think he has an idea, but Idk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward again to last night. Europe boy messaged me for 3 hours straight as I am studying for a final that I had today. I felt like shit. Talking to him made my face hurt. My eyebrows were in constant furrowed shape. To be honest with you, I feel like he is the embodiment of my depression. Everytime I talk to him I am depressed. I shut down. I can\u2019t even communicate with him very well because of it. Which makes for an even longer and more complicated conversation. And doesn\u2019t make him think that I am getting better. I cannot stand it anymore. I want to be done. I can\u2019t get rid of him. The year without him was so blissful. I feel like I really found myself. He says he doesn\u2019t know who I am anymore. I\u2019m not who I was. But to me I think that I am better. I feel bad for what I did to him but there\u2019s only so many times that I can apologize and honestly what kind of apology is good enough for what I did? Any one that I give him he is unhappy with. It is not good enough, and I know that. I don\u2019t know what would be good enough. But it\u2019s not like I want to bring him back into my life again. I only messaged to try to make amends. But I have done much worse. I wish I had left him alone. \nHis whole year without me he said he just felt like shit. He says I wrecked his life. He says I come back and I make it worse still. I didnt do this out of malice. I did not mean to make him feel this way. I simply hoped/thought he would move on. But I guess I underestimated his care. He says that I am humiliating him and scolds me when I ask simple questions or just try to have him see my point of view. He disregards everything I say unless it\u2019s in agreement with what he says. I know this because when I only respond  with \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201cokay\u201d, really small sheep messages, he\u2019s fine. The moment I question him or do not agree he\u2019s pissed. He threatens to kill him self. Says I really fucked him up. And sometimes threatens to leave all my information behind so that I will have blame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. I just want to be rid of this. I have more stress in my life than I already want to handle. This two year nightmare needs to end for both of us. I could really use some advice. Please.

Anxiety is something I know I've always had, but for the first time in October I just broke down one day and just started crying. Now it seems to happen about once a month. Happened in November, and it happened 2 days ago. I just start bawling. Then in a few hours I'll be fine, as if there was nothing wrong in the world.\n\nBut I think the worst was a few week nights ago. I was talking to my mom. I was quiet and reserved, giving short answers. Then I got up and walked to my room. In the Hallway, it was dark, cold, and I just had this horrible, horrible feeling that lasted a few seconds. Just this feeling of \"Why do anything in life if nothing matters because we're all going to die anyway.\" And I agreed with the feeling. Then I got to my room, got into bed, and just cried for a few minutes. I was scared because that was the first and only time where I think I had a suicidal thought, which I've never had before. Anyway, I was just so terrified of what I just thought of. But then a few minutes later I was laughing at stupid memes on Reddit again. \n\nI just don't know what's been going on with me. I talked to my mom about it and she says it's likely Seasonal Depression, which I can see, because of work I hardly get to go out in the daylight. \n\nI know I should see about /r/suicidewatch. I considering it. I just felt like I could just let someone know how I feel. Maybe help suggest how to fix it or something. I could just be screaming into an echo chamber.

It feels impossible to do nearly anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month ago I tried to kill myself. I tried to jump off a building but someone saw me. I decided to step down because I didn&amp;#39;t want to do it in front of anyone and scare someone. The guy who talked me to down actually talked and listened to me and made me feel a little better. Honestly after that, I just wanted to drive home and rest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently there were cameras where I was at and the guy called security. The security told me to wait where I was until the cops showed up. It was all very nerve-wracking and embarrassing for me. Eventually they said they were worried about me and wanted to send me to the hospital for an evaluation. I just wanted to get out of the situation and thought the evaluation would happen overnight. As a result,  I agreed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They put me in handcuffs and sent me to the hospital. I was put in involuntarily for a week and it was one of the worst experiences in my life. It was essentially a prison. They medicated me intensely and it was really isolating and I never knew when I would be able to get out. My psychiatrist was awful and was the one who extended my stay to a whole week which upset me greatly because of my obligations to school and work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt alone, watched, and constantly judged and became very paranoid there. The environment made me even more depressed. I still had to try to fake a good attitude and remain compliant even though I was a wreck and dying inside. Each day that passed by I was feeling worse and worse. I also knew that when I would eventually come back to a worse situation when I had to go back home. This was because I knew I would be very behind in school and work. The only thing that kept me together there was reading a collection of books and doing puzzles at the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually got out and had to go to a treatment program that was all group therapy. I am autistic and have a lot of social anxiety. The weeks I had to do that was incredibly nerve wracking and made me incredible nervous and anxious everytime I was there. It ended doing more harm than good since I had to use all my energy to just stay in the room and could barely listen and focus to whatever was going on there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The therapy and hospitalization put me so behind in school that I had to quit and miss a lot of days of work as well. Now I am left all alone in my apartment with my parents who probably hate and resent me. My mind is a complete and utter mess and I feel completely different. I feel like a part of me and part of my mind and personality has permanently died. I dont feel whole or complete or even alive anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I work remotely and sometimes go to an office but can no longer focus or even think straight after all that has happened. I am scared I will mess up and eventually lose my job. I do writing and coding as part of my job but I cannot even remember the basics of how to do anything that I feel like a complete imbecile. What took me minutes now takes me hours and I have been struggling so hard on a project that I feel like a complete burden to my manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can barely talk or string together sentences in writing or verbally. I don&amp;#39;t know how to connect anyone anymore. I feel like everything I tried to say comes out as incoherent and nonsensical that there&amp;#39;s no I way can truly get people to understand me. It just makes me feel more worthless and hopeless about myself. I have known for a while that I will likely never be able to get married or have a family so I have been trying to get myself to accept that. It just makes me realize how alone I am going to be for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I had to quit school and am now struggling with my job, I feel like a huge failure in life. I have so much idle time on my hands especially on the days I don&amp;#39;t go to the office for work. Everyday I feel so tired and defeated. A huge part of me feels like I should have just died a month ago and there are no real future or prospects left for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel really lost as to what to do with my life now. I cannot go back to school until March. I want to maybe find a second job but I feel so much anxiety in just trying to look for one after all that has happened.  I mean if I can barely do the job I have now, how will I be able to focus and do well in another job. After everything that has happened, I feel like I am going to just fail at everything I try. All the time I have alone now makes me more depressed, anxious, and makes me want to just go out and die even more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am completely lost and without direction in life right now. I was trying to get a bachelors in comp sci and get a job as a programmer / software engineer after that.

I try to read or do projects and nothing feels the same ever and I just feel a sense of dread and sickness when I try to do anything with coding or computers. This feeling stings really hard because I finally felt close to the goal of getting a real professional job and becoming independent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 23 years old and feel like I have failed at everything in life. I don&amp;#39;t know how to talk or connect to anyone in life. I can&amp;#39;t make friends, I feel like a freak or pariah in my family and that they hate for what I have done. I have been struggling to finish school, can now barely do my job, and I still live at home. I want to change things and make changes but I just feel decimated and wrecked after everything that happened that I will fail at anything I&amp;#39;ll try.

I don&amp;#39;t know what do with my time anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the past year I have been working and going to school to fill up my time. A part of this is to distract myself so I dont have the time to feel all the sadness and anxiety that usually gets pent up inside of me.

It would be a burden to any family member (a shitty surprise, in fact), my girlfriend knows about many things already and I&amp;#39;d just scare her with the &amp;quot;Here comes more stuff to worry about!&amp;quot;-news, and there&amp;#39;s a good chance my neurologist-cum-psychologist is legally obligated to institutionalize me for it  (not the US, there are weird but sort-of understandable laws about this) so that&amp;#39;s not going to happen.\nSo here I am, dumping it on you.\nThings aren&amp;#39;t good or bad right now, and I seem to default to &amp;quot;Guess   I shouldn&amp;#39;t exist then&amp;quot;. This has happened many times before. Every time I went through a phase like that, it either went away after a couple of days or turned into a full-on depressive episode - these usually last for a month or two.  This time it&amp;#39;s different, I&amp;#39;ve had these thoughts (or rather, this one thought) daily for almost a year now. I can enjoy things, do stuff I like, feel actual joy, and still go to bed thinking that it would be best if I ceased to exist as soon as possible. It&amp;#39;s the last thought before I fall asleep and the first thought after waking up.

It would be a burden to any family member (a shitty surprise, in fact), my girlfriend knows about many things already and I'd just scare her with the \"Here comes more stuff to worry about!\"-news, and there's a good chance my neurologist-cum-psychologist is legally obligated to institutionalize me for it  (not the US, there are weird but sort-of understandable laws about this) so that's not going to happen.\nSo here I am, dumping it on you.\nThings aren't good or bad right now, and I seem to default to \"Guess   I shouldn't exist then\". This has happened many times before. Every time I went through a phase like that, it either went away after a couple of days or turned into a full-on depressive episode - these usually last for a month or two.  This time it's different, I've had these thoughts (or rather, this one thought) daily for almost a year now.

I suppose some backstory will help tie thing together, I&amp;#39;ll try and keep it brief. As a child life was pretty good until my mother and stepdad got a divorce which made me and my mom relocate a few states over. This is when her drug habit started and when she met the man she&amp;#39;d be with for 8 years or so, we&amp;#39;ll call him Marco. Marco was a terrible man, to my knowledge he was never physically abusive but the mental anguish he caused for me and my mother was horrible. Eventually they had both realized that if they didn&amp;#39;t leave the area the drugs were going to kill them. So they had decided we were going to move across the country to Marco&amp;#39;s hometown. Up until this point I had a semi decent social life with the other neighborhood kids, I won&amp;#39;t lie I was pretty weird and didn&amp;#39;t fit in much as a child but I made due. However once we moved things changed in that category pretty drastically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was never the all-star academic student but I was far from the worst, this however wasn&amp;#39;t good enough for Marco. If I hadn&amp;#39;t done a homework assignment or had gotten a bad grade on a test Marco would insist I be grounded inside until report cards came after the 9 week quarter was over. So needless to say I was grounded without any social interaction for most of 6th-10th grade. The only bit of a social life I had was going to church, which neither of them attended, and joining the wrestling team which I hated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to 10th grade and my mother was fed up with Marco&amp;#39;s nonsense so she left him, we talked and she told me of all the things that led us to be where we were (escaping the drugs). It was the first time she had treated me like an adult and it helped form a very strong trust and understanding of one another. Now up until this point she was pretty much just a stay at home mom but when they separated she started working a lot. She gave me the opportunity to be the kid I wasn&amp;#39;t ever allowed to be with Marco around, for the first time in my life I had a taste of freedom. This led to me focusing on all the wrong things and not concerning myself with important things like school and my future, so I lived it up until graduation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t go to college straight out of high school because I thought I had a good job lined up but it ended up falling through so I got a job as a line cook for the time being, or so I thought. The evils that are routine had gotten the best of me and I was stuck for a few years. I finally managed to break myself of it and enroll in community college. That&amp;#39;s when I thought things were all changing for the better but alas I was wrong. I wasn&amp;#39;t working as much because I was going to school 5 days a week so I would pretty regularly ask my mom for gas money(it was a half hour drive one way in a 96 Buick century) and things like that which she would give me but not without making me feel terrible for asking. I know she didn&amp;#39;t mean to but she was a single mom and money was always tight. So I stopped asking her for money figuring I could skip a couple classes a week to save money. My grades certainly took a hit and I couldn&amp;#39;t keep making excuses as to why I wasn&amp;#39;t going to class. So I started going about my day as normal but instead of getting up and going to class I would drive to the back of the supermarket by our house, park my car, and sit there until it would be time for me to &amp;quot;get home from class&amp;quot;. I just didn&amp;#39;t want to disappoint her but I didn&amp;#39;t know what else to do. Eventually I dropped out, always making excuses as to why I wasn&amp;#39;t going until she eventually stopped asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward again and I&amp;#39;ve landed a pretty solid job(I fix nail guns bruh) and me and my gf of 4ish years have our own place. It was nothing special but it was ours. Things are going pretty well until I left to go visit family across the country and come back to my gf telling me she&amp;#39;s leaving me. It hurt but I was largely ok mentally, financially however it crippled me. I limped along for as long as I could but I knew the end was coming and it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be pretty. During this time however I managed to track down my father(who didn&amp;#39;t know that I existed) and he accepted me as part of the family immediately. Oddly enough he lived only a few hours away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The financial burden became so intense that I knew I had to do something and quick or else I was going to lose what little I had. I spoke to my boss about a raise she had mentioned a few months prior but she basically told me to pound salt. Being as stressed and stretched thin as I was I flipped out which ultimately led me to quit. However with my technician experience I figured it wouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard to find work and quick but that just wasn&amp;#39;t the case. I was behind on all of my bills including rent and now I had no income. My dad offered to let me come stay with him which is were the present kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been here for roughly 3 months and still haven&amp;#39;t told my dad about my financial troubles. My car insurance lapsed about a month after arriving because I literally can&amp;#39;t ask for help, I don&amp;#39;t know why but I just can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m still currently jobless and now I live in the middle of nowhere in which you need a vehicle to get anywhere. Oh and I forgot to mention that I had everything automatically taking bills from my bank account which now sits at roughly -500ish dollars. So I can&amp;#39;t open an account anywhere until I have that payed for, I can&amp;#39;t pay for it until I have a job and I can&amp;#39;t get a job until my car insurance is taken care of so it&amp;#39;s a vicious circle. The extreme fear I have of disappointing the ones close to me has prevented me from reaching out. I&amp;#39;ve always tried keeping a positive attitude because I knew there could be a positive future. I&amp;#39;ve since lost that positivity and now I feel lost and stuck. My dad had gifted me a Glock .40 for my birthday as something to bond over. I find myself daily sitting with it on my lap in my room alone waiting for the moment in which I feel I cannot handle the failure any longer. I&amp;#39;ve never been the one to have these types of thoughts which is what scares me the most, but sadly I&amp;#39;ve come to the realization that I might not be around much longer and I don&amp;#39;t know where to start to change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "To be honest I'm not too sure that this belongs here and if it doesn't please direct me to where it should be posted.

No signs of him anywhere and I am heartbroken on top of everything else. Friends just tell me to get over it and stop being sad all the time.

But how? How can you raise your child the way you want to with no examples for her to follow? How can you be a provider that works for someone else? How can you wake up smiling everyday when you realize that you haven\u2019t made new friends in 6 months since you moved, you never even saw your old friends while you lived back home, and you realize that every single dream you had in your life is crumbling before your eyes? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am at a loss here.

My fianc\u00e9 relies on me for the simplest tasks, we moved from a city with potential (my POV) to the fucking boonies because I thought this job had a lot to offer, and I feel like I am turning into my dad; a good man with a good heart but no specialized, well-refined skills and an anger problem that arises every time something that doesn\u2019t go right or even if something goes great for someone else. He has improved a great deal since I was a kid and he gives me great advice on staying positive, but I am tired.

Worse yet, my dad is essentially in the same situation as me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t stand hearing everyone talking to each other. Isn\u2019t that fucking insane??? I hate hearing people have fun, happy, joking conversations, because I don\u2019t have those. I have fun with my daughter, but I barely enjoy anything else except smoking a cigarette and some pot because I know it brings me just a little bit closer to the end. But I don\u2019t want to feel like that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always tried to grow up too fast with the hope that things will get better as you age. They sure fucking don\u2019t! I know it\u2019s true for more than just myself. One thing that keeps me going is that I\u2019m not alone in my suffering, but why am I suffering? It\u2019s because we are simply surviving in a world that has gone beyond simple survival. Society is able to have fun with excess money. They can climb a deadly mountain or swim with sharks to have fun. My fun is the occasional take out Chinese or pizza, but I want so much more. Mainly a career in which I wake up everyday and look forward to accomplishing something. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m wasting the majority of every week serving a bunch of other fuckheads that provide overprivileged people with more ways to make more money. Otherwise, I\u2019ll just keep falling deeper and deeper into this endless pit that I keep digging.

How can you wake up smiling everyday when you realize that you haven\u2019t made new friends in 6 months since you moved, you never even saw your old friends while you lived back home, and you realize that every single dream you had in your life is crumbling before your eyes? \n\nI am at a loss here. I know what I want out of life, but I don\u2019t have the slightest clue on how to achieve any of them under the circumstances. My fianc\u00e9 relies on me for the simplest tasks, we moved from a city with potential (my POV) to the fucking boonies because I thought this job had a lot to offer, and I feel like I am turning into my dad; a good man with a good heart but no specialized, well-refined skills and an anger problem that arises every time something that doesn\u2019t go right or even if something goes great for someone else. He has improved a great deal since I was a kid and he gives me great advice on staying positive, but I am tired. It\u2019s so hard staying positive while everyone around you looks like the fucking Brady Bunch. Worse yet, my dad is essentially in the same situation as me!\n\nI can\u2019t stand hearing everyone talking to each other. Isn\u2019t that fucking insane??? I hate hearing people have fun, happy, joking conversations, because I don\u2019t have those. I have fun with my daughter, but I barely enjoy anything else except smoking a cigarette and some pot because I know it brings me just a little bit closer to the end. But I don\u2019t want to feel like that!\n\nI have always tried to grow up too fast with the hope that things will get better as you age. They sure fucking don\u2019t! I know it\u2019s true for more than just myself. One thing that keeps me going is that I\u2019m not alone in my suffering, but why am I suffering? It\u2019s because we are simply surviving in a world that has gone beyond simple survival. Society is able to have fun with excess money. They can climb a deadly mountain or swim with sharks to have fun. My fun is the occasional take out Chinese or pizza, but I want so much more. Mainly a career in which I wake up everyday and look forward to accomplishing something. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m wasting the majority of every week serving a bunch of other fuckheads that provide overprivileged people with more ways to make more money. Otherwise, I\u2019ll just keep falling deeper and deeper into this endless pit that I keep digging. I have days when I can see some light, but most days the clouds block out the sun.\n\nThis is my first real post, but I needed to tell someone. Even if only 1 person reads this all the way through, thank you. I appreciate the time you\u2019ve sacrificed to read my petty complaint that you\u2019ve probably heard time and time again. If not, I tried.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i1dny", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I deserve Happiness Too", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 6, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i1dny", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7i1dny/i_deserve_happiness_too/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512625164.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i1dny/i_deserve_happiness_too/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ZebraServedFresh", "created_utc": 1512596364.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: i presented about art (my hobby and only thing i still have) at university and my friend is in that course.

We study together and we go to uni together with the car, so we spend a lot of time with each other.

I did not care that the rest was really annoyed by it, they are maths students and everyone only wants a grade there, and probably noone understood a word, but 1.

I can't think of a reason to care what people think of me. Can't think of a reason to smile when I feel like crying. Can't think of a reason to get up and out of bad and go to work and be nice to people and chat and not fucking cut myself again. I miss it so bad.\n\nIf you made it through all that, thanks. I don't want to tell this to anyone irl, so this is kind of my only outlet. Hope you have a better day than me.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i4nc7",

Only, I wasn't invited to any of these things. None of my mates in any of my groups thought it worthwhile to tell me that they were planning shit until after everything was set and booked. Of course by this time I can't get leave from work and can't visit the airbnb for a couple days like they suggest. And the more I sit alone in my room staring at my computer monitor I just think about how little I'm experiencing as a teenager. I'm doing nothing worthwhile of a story. I want to experience shit, I want to have fun, I want to make mistakes, go on adventures, see something totally fucked up. Just anything that's makes me feel like my life is worth sharing. But the fact is it's not. I'm not going on a schoolies trip. I have to get plus 1'd to parties. I've never smoked weed or done any other drugs. I haven't been to a totally out of control party where the cops get called in or other cunts start fights or just... I don't know. Anything happens. I just want something different other than waking up at 4 in the afternoon, going to work, coming home, wanking and then going to sleep for dinner. It feels like everything is black and white. \n\nI know how wank and petty this sounds but honestly it just makes me want to fucking cry, as pathetic as that sounds. But I can't.

I\u2019ve never been medically diagnosed with depression, although I feel like I am depressed. I always feel unmotivated, discontent with life, and usually want to be alone in my space and thoughts. People in school always ask am I okay because I always look sad and uninterested, despite my talkative and somewhat outgoing personality. Some days I feel like I\u2019m on top of life, and others I feel like there\u2019s no point of life with death being eminent. I had suicidal thoughts two years ago which lasted for about a year, however I never did anything to potentially harm myself. I am a moderate marijuana smoker in my opinion, and I have been smoking since the summer of 2016. I\u2019m never blowed out of my mind and mainly smoke just to feel it. (i have a thc oil cartridge [the clear] which i smoke from and will rebuy when i run out of oil as I feel the need mentally or even if I\u2019m bored, but can go days without weed if there\u2019s no urge). Marijuana might be the only reason I haven\u2019t thought about off-ing myself. It helps me think and find solace in the fucked up world we live in. I also find happiness and peace in EDM (electronic dance music) that talks about love and life that come from people such as Illenium, EDEN, Audien, etc. I find happiness only in money, weed, and music. I have a girlfriend who I have been with for 10 months now, and have been repressing many feelings about how I feel about her. I let the bad things she does slide all the time, but every time I do something as little as not text her goodmorning, it\u2019s World War 3. We don\u2019t have sex because she made me wait so long for it which made me uninterested in it with her, and she\u2019s not exactly the most flirtatious person and isn\u2019t really pleasing me sexually and in my eyes she\u2019s not even trying to. I try talking to her and every time I do, it\u2019s like I\u2019m tripping to her or I\u2019m not paying attention to how she feels enough. I\u2019ve been trying my hardest to be the best thing in her life, but everything I do is wrong or not good enough to her, which leads to anxiety when I\u2019m with her. She constantly tells me I\u2019m a good boyfriend, but her constant criticism says something different. As much as I want to be single, I put a year into this girl and only have 6 months until high school graduation. I figured might as well stick it out until then, for her, but at the same time I\u2019m sacrificing my happiness for hers. Tbh, this feels like a bad marriage to me... stuck and wanting to leave, but the seldom good outweighs the often bad in the relationship. I really don\u2019t know if the grass is greener on the other side, which is why I stick around. I also grew up in a 6 figure household, way better off financially than a lot of my peers, I\u2019m rather good looking and am aware of that, so my looks and money shouldn\u2019t contribute to why I feel this way. At the age of 13, my dad died and it has been just me and my mother since July 2013. I rarely think about him, and try not to because I know that will bring up crying and more emotions that reminds me of death and the end of life. My mom tried to push the grieving process onto me as best she could, and made me go to counseling with her, but I shut out the help because I didn\u2019t want it or feel like I needed it. It got to a point in my life where I was just living, not looking for the good things in life. Literally just living in a rut, doing the same things over and over, just because that\u2019s what life to me is. You do everything how you see fit to find happiness in the world, until your time comes. The only problem was, I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t know if I will find happiness ever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know if this depression-like feeling is really depression. If it is, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming from my own thoughts of second guessing the good I have to find in my life for myself as it comes, or if it stems from my own self destruction from my somewhat toxic relationship, or if it\u2019s from subconscious grieving due to the death of my father at a young age, or if it\u2019s just me being \u201cdramatic\u201d in the eyes of most. I don\u2019t feel suicidal because I know there\u2019s good out there in the world, and I want to experience the good, and don\u2019t want to give up the good chances I have of success considering coming from a high income family, two parents with degrees, enrollment in many extra curricular programs that teach skills such as leadership development and professionalism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I said, I just want to know your guy\u2019s thoughts on what you think could be the issue(s) in my life. Please be as honest as possible. Please do not hesitate to ask questions to better understand my feelings. And again, please help me find the wrongs in my life so I can try to kick these depressed feelings without seeking professional help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Im 17, African American, resident of Detroit Michigan and a high school senior.

Some days I feel like I\u2019m on top of life, and others I feel like there\u2019s no point of life with death being eminent. I had suicidal thoughts two years ago which lasted for about a year, however I never did anything to potentially harm myself. I am a moderate marijuana smoker in my opinion, and I have been smoking since the summer of 2016. I\u2019m never blowed out of my mind and mainly smoke just to feel it. (i have a thc oil cartridge [the clear] which i smoke from and will rebuy when i run out of oil as I feel the need mentally or even if I\u2019m bored, but can go days without weed if there\u2019s no urge). Marijuana might be the only reason I haven\u2019t thought about off-ing myself. It helps me think and find solace in the fucked up world we live in. I also find happiness and peace in EDM (electronic dance music) that talks about love and life that come from people such as Illenium, EDEN, Audien, etc. I find happiness only in money, weed, and music. I have a girlfriend who I have been with for 10 months now, and have been repressing many feelings about how I feel about her. I let the bad things she does slide all the time, but every time I do something as little as not text her goodmorning, it\u2019s World War 3. We don\u2019t have sex because she made me wait so long for it which made me uninterested in it with her, and she\u2019s not exactly the most flirtatious person and isn\u2019t really pleasing me sexually and in my eyes she\u2019s not even trying to. I try talking to her and every time I do, it\u2019s like I\u2019m tripping to her or I\u2019m not paying attention to how she feels enough. I\u2019ve been trying my hardest to be the best thing in her life, but everything I do is wrong or not good enough to her, which leads to anxiety when I\u2019m with her. She constantly tells me I\u2019m a good boyfriend, but her constant criticism says something different. As much as I want to be single, I put a year into this girl and only have 6 months until high school graduation. I figured might as well stick it out until then, for her, but at the same time I\u2019m sacrificing my happiness for hers. Tbh, this feels like a bad marriage to me... stuck and wanting to leave, but the seldom good outweighs the often bad in the relationship. I really don\u2019t know if the grass is greener on the other side, which is why I stick around. I also grew up in a 6 figure household, way better off financially than a lot of my peers, I\u2019m rather good looking and am aware of that, so my looks and money shouldn\u2019t contribute to why I feel this way. At the age of 13, my dad died and it has been just me and my mother since July 2013. I rarely think about him, and try not to because I know that will bring up crying and more emotions that reminds me of death and the end of life. My mom tried to push the grieving process onto me as best she could, and made me go to counseling with her, but I shut out the help because I didn\u2019t want it or feel like I needed it. It got to a point in my life where I was just living, not looking for the good things in life. Literally just living in a rut, doing the same things over and over, just because that\u2019s what life to me is. You do everything how you see fit to find happiness in the world, until your time comes. The only problem was, I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t know if I will find happiness ever. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this depression-like feeling is really depression. If it is, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming from my own thoughts of second guessing the good I have to find in my life for myself as it comes, or if it stems from my own self destruction from my somewhat toxic relationship, or if it\u2019s from subconscious grieving due to the death of my father at a young age, or if it\u2019s just me being \u201cdramatic\u201d in the eyes of most. I don\u2019t feel suicidal because I know there\u2019s good out there in the world, and I want to experience the good, and don\u2019t want to give up the good chances I have of success considering coming from a high income family, two parents with degrees, enrollment in many extra curricular programs that teach skills such as leadership development and professionalism. \n\nFrom what I said, I just want to know your guy\u2019s thoughts on what you think could be the issue(s) in my life. Please be as honest as possible. Please do not hesitate to ask questions to better understand my feelings. And again, please help me find the wrongs in my life so I can try to kick these depressed feelings without seeking professional help.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i3tsa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Idk Why I Feel Like This", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i3tsa", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7i3tsa/idk_why_i_feel_like_this/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512648146.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i3tsa/idk_why_i_feel_like_this/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Inphenity", "created_utc": 1512619346.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode has been more than 4 years.

My throat wouldn&amp;#39;t work properly. The wrong words, the right words. Fuck hardly any words came out. I can&amp;#39;t understand how she could have seen me struggle like that and not want to do exactly what I so desperately wanted: for her to just hold me tight and tell me it would be OK, that she would help.

I don&amp;#39;t even know where to start I&amp;#39;ve been stuffing things down and suppressing so much for so long that I&amp;#39;m finding it difficult to think with clarity and articulate myself clearly. I&amp;#39;ve tried to pinpoint when exactly it was I started to feel like I was in a haze, lost, out of touch with myself. It seems I could trace it back to a little over a year ago. I had ended a relationship with a &amp;quot;former&amp;quot; drug addict and harbored a lot of resentment to him. My reasons for dating him weren&amp;#39;t that great either. I felt like I was a little bit better than him. That I would be some kind of prize. So I went for him. I thought I could be the best girlfriend ever. Mold him into my perfect man. Love him into changing. Surely I would be worth it. Well the next 5 years proved to be futile. I was constantly disappointed, let down, resentful. I felt guilty for being angry with him because I was the one that CHOSE to be with him. I couldn&amp;#39;t really blame anyone but myself. There was a lot wrong with that relationship but one of the most frustrating things was our sex life. I felt it was non existent. He didn&amp;#39;t have much of a drive and he was also a bit repressed. Deep down, I craved intimacy, depth, sexual liberation, exploration. I fantasized constantly about the sexual experiences I wanted to have or do again. This eventually turned into me watching a lot of porn and taking care of my own needs. \nWe eventually broke up over his addiction but still remained &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;.  Soon after that I took a trip overseas and ended up binge drinking one night and hooking up with someone. I barely remember it but from what I do recall I was enjoying myself quite a bit. When I finally came too. I ended up calling him and telling him about it. He was angry. I knew he would be. Although we weren&amp;#39;t technically together. We still shared intimacy and I felt guilty. I also felt relived in some way too. Like finally I did something that would end this relationship once and for all. No back and forth. I also liked that freedom in knowing I could explore my sexuality again. I was free to choose. No more consigning myself to porn and masturbation. I could do the things I desired. When I returned home we talked in person and he was quite angry and hurt. But also wanted to continue having a relationship. I on the other hand felt like I was done.&lt;br/&gt;\nSince it had been so long since I had been part of the dating world I sort of stepped back into that stuff with little steps. Perhaps not the smartest things but I did what I felt comfortable with.  I was scared of getting out there and meeting people. Afraid of diseases, people playing games. But I was tired of my porn and solo masturbation. I ended up using things like whisper app to sext anonymous people. Using phone chat lines to have anymous phone sex.  I wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily content with this but at the time it was fun and it felt (somewhat) safe. Eventually I met someone on the whisper app that was a bit different. I was drinking one night, I was alone, feeling horny. I got on the app and asked if someone wanted to &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; Skype. I ended getting a response with some guy overseas. I was intrigued and after messaging him for a bit it was clear that we were both in a very sexual mood. We made a Skype phone call and started talking. I was a bit more comfortable than I normally would&amp;#39;ve been because of the alcohol. So I quickly revealed my fantasies and the kind of sex I liked and wanted. I asked if I could call him daddy. His response was &amp;quot;of course, baby girl&amp;quot;. I remember feeling this huge sigh of relief and losing myself in the daddy fantasy and he was right there with me. It was amazing. I should say that I&amp;#39;ve always had this kink. I never knew much about it in the context of bdsm. But it was always something I wanted to indulge in. Anyway it was clear that he really like my kink and we continued talking for the next few hours and then again the next day, and the day after. I felt like we were just having fun, enjoying this mutual kink. He then asked me about more of my fantasies, the things I liked, kinky and non-kinky. He told me about some of his fantasies. He even asked if I would like for daddy to give me some tasks. I said yes. Feeling intrigued, and excited. This was different. He told me to send him greeting texts everyday and to send picture of my underwear. I thought maybe that&amp;#39;s too much. I even brought that up with him. He told me only to do it if I was comfortable but that daddy would really appreciate it.  Later on in that same Skype he asked me to get a marker and write I belong to daddy on my chest. I did it and thought. I guess that&amp;#39;s kind of hot, but is it a bit much? I kept that thought to myself. I was enjoying this close attention so much. He really seemed to like that. He even said he didn&amp;#39;t take that lightly. Again another thing that I thought seemed a bit strong. But I liked it. He started saying things like you like belonging to someone . You like being daddy&amp;#39;s property. He then asked how I was feeling, what I was thinking. I said I felt good. Although I was also feeling a bit odd. Trying to understand what was happening. Was this a game? Was this real? What was it? \nI continued sending pictures and greeting texts. We skyped again. He asked about that writing on myself. Saying he hoped to see it again. I was confused. I didn&amp;#39;t want to write on myself with a marker everyday. He looked hurt, but asked if there was something else I would enjoy doing more. He said he wasn&amp;#39;t upset with me but was trying to understand how I think. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but to feel like I let him down. He said what just happened was normal. That it was ok and we could figure something else to do that I may enjoy more. This interaction was like nothing I&amp;#39;d ever experienced before. It was all so new. Later on the day I was thinking about him, missing him, wanting to be close to him.\nI took a pen. Went into the bathroom stall at work, pulled up my shirt and wrote &amp;quot;I belong to daddy&amp;quot; on my chest. I took a picture and sent it to him. He was overjoyed saying he felt like my &amp;quot;true daddy dom&amp;quot; I felt amazing too. Like something finally clicked. That writing on myself felt like some kind of link to him. Something only he and I knew about, something I did for only him. From then on I write that on myself everyday. I loved knowing it was there. I felt this connection to him despite the distance. I loved what I was feeling. I also started feeling like I would do more and more for him.\nIt was great for a little while but then I noticed things starting to change. He wasn&amp;#39;t as quick to respond. His messages weren&amp;#39;t as inquisitive. He seemed to be hurried more. I eventually asked him about this and told him that we could stop this thing we had. That I was grateful for the experience but I didn&amp;#39;t want to drag things out and do them out of obligation. He agreed, &amp;quot;released me&amp;quot;, and said I could reach out any time. For about 2 days after that I felt ok. Like it was all worth it. And that I learned something very important about myself. But then this withdrawal feeling started to kick in. What now? I want a comforting daddy. I missed tasks and being a good girl. I missed the sift and firm contrast of his presence. I felt like I was on the brink of some intense self discovery and then it came to a screeching halt. I felt crushed. I reached out to him asking about what I should do now. He gave me some general sounding response about being adaptable. I thanked him for his response but was disappointed. Again a few days passed and more thoughts flooded my mind. I want to submit again. I want to continue this. If not with him, with someone. How do I navigate from here?What&amp;#39;s happening? I reached out to him again. This time he never responded. I felt completely destroyed. Angry at myself, like a fool. I thought he was better than that. I thought he would tell me if he didn&amp;#39;t want to talk. I certainly didn&amp;#39;t think he was the type to ghost. But that&amp;#39;s exactly what he did. The next few weeks I dealt with depression, confusion and thus new hunger in me that couldn&amp;#39;t seem to satisfy. I spent hours googling and reading about ddlg, bdsm, and kink. I eventually found fetlife and very quickly got into the personals in there. Looking for my next &amp;quot;daddy&amp;quot; it wasn&amp;#39;t the smartest move but I wanted it so bad. I also know I wanted a pleasant distraction from my pain.\nEventually I met some people on there that were nice and tried to offer a little guidance. They explained I was having a sort of &amp;quot;sub frenzy&amp;quot;. They encouraged me to attend a munch in my local community. I did that and enjoyed it somewhat but still had a bit of anxiety.   I still couldn&amp;#39;t shake that feeling either. That hunger. I eventually tried to meet someone off fetlife with the same kink. Online it was ok and then we finally did meet and I wasnt attracted to him. I also didn&amp;#39;t feel the chemistry in the flesh. He respected that, was very kind and we decided to go our separate ways. I was back at square one. Feeling empty, hungry, confused, hurt. I eventually got back on that whisper app and started messaging someone, the of course sexting like before. I also called him daddy because I liked too. But it wasn&amp;#39;t deep. It wasn&amp;#39;t like the last time. He just thought I was being kinky I was but I was also satisfying that hunger a bit albeit a very little bit but it was better than nothing. Than out of nowhere that foreign guy &amp;quot;daddy&amp;quot; messages me, saying &amp;quot;hey&amp;quot;. I was relived, happy, and angry all at once. I told him how I was feeling how I was just starting to accept the fact that he didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me. To see me. He said he was sorry and that he was also sorry for reaching out. But I said it was ok. I missed him. I wanted to cling to him. We eventually started talking again. Sexting and having naught chats. But this time it was different. There were no more tasks. I didn&amp;#39;t call him daddy and he was much more rough this time around. Wanting to humiliate and degrade me. I tried to go along with it because I wanted to keep him but I couldn&amp;#39;t. I couldn&amp;#39;t trust that he wouldn&amp;#39;t disappear again. I couldn&amp;#39;t let go and submit like before. I told him this and he seemed to admire and respect what I told him. I was feeling like I had a bit of closure and that I was finally able to put him behind me. But this desire to submit. This longing for daddy never went away. \nI eventually tried dating locally and met someone that seemed interesting and who was into my kink. Upon reflection there were things I noticed about this person that didn&amp;#39;t quite sit right with me but I minimized those feelings and pursued them anyway.  I was so desperate to get my &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot;. This is where things get heavy and  I start losing myself. This is where the guilt and shame come in. I used this man. I used him to project my fantasy onto. I called him daddy and was submissive to him but pretty much guided the whole thing. As much as I wanted daddy I was voracious and wanted explore my sexuality and this kinky world I had discovered. I tried to be really honest with him about this part but realized he would feel hurt and emotionally react when I brought up this truth. Eventually I quit sharing everything. I started second guessing what would say. Censoring myself so I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to deal with his emotional reactions. This relationship was one that Im still trying to clear the fog surrounding it. It was amazing and beautiful in some ways but painful, and confusing in other ways. He hurt me but I know I hurt him.  With this man I really bonded. I showed him so much of myself and he showed me so much of himself. I still miss him but feel in some ways he is not good for me. I don&amp;#39;t know. I think I&amp;#39;ll continue writing this later. I feel spent as of right now. Thanks to anyone that reads this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I don't care if anyone reads this or not I just need a safe space to vent my thoughts and feelings.  I don't even know where to start I've been stuffing things down and suppressing so much for so long that I'm finding it difficult to think with clarity and articulate myself clearly. I've tried to pinpoint when exactly it was I started to feel like I was in a haze, lost, out of touch with myself. It seems I could trace it back to a little over a year ago. I had ended a relationship with a \"former\" drug addict and harbored a lot of resentment to him. My reasons for dating him weren't that great either. I felt like I was a little bit better than him. That I would be some kind of prize. So I went for him. I thought I could be the best girlfriend ever. Mold him into my perfect man. Love him into changing. Surely I would be worth it. Well the next 5 years proved to be futile. I was constantly disappointed, let down, resentful. I felt guilty for being angry with him because I was the one that CHOSE to be with him. I couldn't really blame anyone but myself. There was a lot wrong with that relationship but one of the most frustrating things was our sex life. I felt it was non existent. He didn't have much of a drive and he was also a bit repressed. Deep down, I craved intimacy, depth, sexual liberation, exploration. I fantasized constantly about the sexual experiences I wanted to have or do again. This eventually turned into me watching a lot of porn and taking care of my own needs. \nWe eventually broke up over his addiction but still remained \"friends\".  Soon after that I took a trip overseas and ended up binge drinking one night and hooking up with someone. I barely remember it but from what I do recall I was enjoying myself quite a bit. When I finally came too. I ended up calling him and telling him about it. He was angry. I knew he would be. Although we weren't technically together. We still shared intimacy and I felt guilty. I also felt relived in some way too. Like finally I did something that would end this relationship once and for all. No back and forth. I also liked that freedom in knowing I could explore my sexuality again. I was free to choose. No more consigning myself to porn and masturbation. I could do the things I desired. When I returned home we talked in person and he was quite angry and hurt. But also wanted to continue having a relationship. I on the other hand felt like I was done.  \nSince it had been so long since I had been part of the dating world I sort of stepped back into that stuff with little steps. Perhaps not the smartest things but I did what I felt comfortable with.  I was scared of getting out there and meeting people. Afraid of diseases, people playing games. But I was tired of my porn and solo masturbation. I ended up using things like whisper app to sext anonymous people. Using phone chat lines to have anymous phone sex.  I wasn't necessarily content with this but at the time it was fun and it felt (somewhat) safe. Eventually I met someone on the whisper app that was a bit different. I was drinking one night, I was alone, feeling horny. I got on the app and asked if someone wanted to \"clean\" Skype. I ended getting a response with some guy overseas. I was intrigued and after messaging him for a bit it was clear that we were both in a very sexual mood. We made a Skype phone call and started talking. I was a bit more comfortable than I normally would've been because of the alcohol. So I quickly revealed my fantasies and the kind of sex I liked and wanted. I asked if I could call him daddy. His response was \"of course, baby girl\". I remember feeling this huge sigh of relief and losing myself in the daddy fantasy and he was right there with me. It was amazing. I should say that I've always had this kink. I never knew much about it in the context of bdsm. But it was always something I wanted to indulge in. Anyway it was clear that he really like my kink and we continued talking for the next few hours and then again the next day, and the day after. I felt like we were just having fun, enjoying this mutual kink. He then asked me about more of my fantasies, the things I liked, kinky and non-kinky. He told me about some of his fantasies. He even asked if I would like for daddy to give me some tasks. I said yes. Feeling intrigued, and excited. This was different. He told me to send him greeting texts everyday and to send picture of my underwear. I thought maybe that's too much. I even brought that up with him. He told me only to do it if I was comfortable but that daddy would really appreciate it.  Later on in that same Skype he asked me to get a marker and write I belong to daddy on my chest. I did it and thought. I guess that's kind of hot, but is it a bit much? I kept that thought to myself. I was enjoying this close attention so much. He really seemed to like that. He even said he didn't take that lightly. Again another thing that I thought seemed a bit strong. But I liked it. He started saying things like you like belonging to someone . You like being daddy's property. He then asked how I was feeling, what I was thinking. I said I felt good. Although I was also feeling a bit odd. Trying to understand what was happening. Was this a game? Was this real? What was it? \nI continued sending pictures and greeting texts. We skyped again. He asked about that writing on myself. Saying he hoped to see it again. I was confused. I didn't want to write on myself with a marker everyday. He looked hurt, but asked if there was something else I would enjoy doing more. He said he wasn't upset with me but was trying to understand how I think. I couldn't help but to feel like I let him down. He said what just happened was normal. That it was ok and we could figure something else to do that I may enjoy more. This interaction was like nothing I'd ever experienced before. It was all so new. Later on the day I was thinking about him, missing him, wanting to be close to him.\nI took a pen. Went into the bathroom stall at work, pulled up my shirt and wrote \"I belong to daddy\" on my chest. I took a picture and sent it to him. He was overjoyed saying he felt like my \"true daddy dom\" I felt amazing too. Like something finally clicked. That writing on myself felt like some kind of link to him. Something only he and I knew about, something I did for only him. From then on I write that on myself everyday. I loved knowing it was there. I felt this connection to him despite the distance. I loved what I was feeling. I also started feeling like I would do more and more for him.\nIt was great for a little while but then I noticed things starting to change. He wasn't as quick to respond. His messages weren't as inquisitive. He seemed to be hurried more. I eventually asked him about this and told him that we could stop this thing we had. That I was grateful for the experience but I didn't want to drag things out and do them out of obligation. He agreed, \"released me\", and said I could reach out any time. For about 2 days after that I felt ok. Like it was all worth it. And that I learned something very important about myself. But then this withdrawal feeling started to kick in. What now? I want a comforting daddy. I missed tasks and being a good girl. I missed the sift and firm contrast of his presence. I felt like I was on the brink of some intense self discovery and then it came to a screeching halt. I felt crushed. I reached out to him asking about what I should do now. He gave me some general sounding response about being adaptable. I thanked him for his response but was disappointed. Again a few days passed and more thoughts flooded my mind. I want to submit again. I want to continue this. If not with him, with someone. How do I navigate from here?What's happening? I reached out to him again. This time he never responded. I felt completely destroyed. Angry at myself, like a fool. I thought he was better than that. I thought he would tell me if he didn't want to talk. I certainly didn't think he was the type to ghost. But that's exactly what he did. The next few weeks I dealt with depression, confusion and thus new hunger in me that couldn't seem to satisfy. I spent hours googling and reading about ddlg, bdsm, and kink. I eventually found fetlife and very quickly got into the personals in there. Looking for my next \"daddy\" it wasn't the smartest move but I wanted it so bad. I also know I wanted a pleasant distraction from my pain.\nEventually I met some people on there that were nice and tried to offer a little guidance. They explained I was having a sort of \"sub frenzy\". They encouraged me to attend a munch in my local community. I did that and enjoyed it somewhat but still had a bit of anxiety.   I still couldn't shake that feeling either. That hunger. I eventually tried to meet someone off fetlife with the same kink. Online it was ok and then we finally did meet and I wasnt attracted to him. I also didn't feel the chemistry in the flesh. He respected that, was very kind and we decided to go our separate ways. I was back at square one. Feeling empty, hungry, confused, hurt. I eventually got back on that whisper app and started messaging someone, the of course sexting like before. I also called him daddy because I liked too. But it wasn't deep. It wasn't like the last time. He just thought I was being kinky I was but I was also satisfying that hunger a bit albeit a very little bit but it was better than nothing. Than out of nowhere that foreign guy \"daddy\" messages me, saying \"hey\". I was relived, happy, and angry all at once. I told him how I was feeling how I was just starting to accept the fact that he didn't want to talk to me. To see me. He said he was sorry and that he was also sorry for reaching out. But I said it was ok. I missed him. I wanted to cling to him. We eventually started talking again. Sexting and having naught chats. But this time it was different. There were no more tasks. I didn't call him daddy and he was much more rough this time around. Wanting to humiliate and degrade me. I tried to go along with it because I wanted to keep him but I couldn't. I couldn't trust that he wouldn't disappear again. I couldn't let go and submit like before. I told him this and he seemed to admire and respect what I told him. I was feeling like I had a bit of closure and that I was finally able to put him behind me. But this desire to submit. This longing for daddy never went away. \nI eventually tried dating locally and met someone that seemed interesting and who was into my kink. Upon reflection there were things I noticed about this person that didn't quite sit right with me but I minimized those feelings and pursued them anyway.  I was so desperate to get my \"fix\". This is where things get heavy and  I start losing myself. This is where the guilt and shame come in. I used this man. I used him to project my fantasy onto. I called him daddy and was submissive to him but pretty much guided the whole thing. As much as I wanted daddy I was voracious and wanted explore my sexuality and this kinky world I had discovered.

I mean, it was his pet after all, but I took care of Pumpkin too. So, even I should have been sad too, right?\n\nBut I was like, \"Oh, he's dead? Okay. At least he's not suffering anymore tho. Hey, what's for breakfast?\"\n\nAnd then my hamster Pepper died a few days ago. Some infected wound on his belly that grew and grew until it was eating him alive. Suffered for almost a month, too. Around the same time I was at the 4th or 5th lowest point of my life.\n\nAgain, When I woke up last Monday and my dad told me, I was like, \"Oh, so that's why the living room doesnt smell like rotting hamster flesh anymore. Hey, what's for breakfast?\"\n\nAnd the day before Pepper died, I cleaned his wound that morning, stroked his furry head, cooed at him, gave him spinach, and told him that the people of Reddit loves him too and prays for him to live longer. At least, until Christmas.\n\nHe didn't make it. He made it through my birthday, but not Christmas.\n\nI have grieved harder and longer for my other pets, from my dogs and parrots, to my other hamsters and guinea pigs and rabbits, and gold fishes and arowanas and flower horns, regardless of how long they lived, but why, for the animal that helped me get through the shittiest points of my life, one of the few reasons why I haven't killed myself yet, why do I feel...weird? Not sad, not pain, but weird.\n\nLike, a mixture of relief\u2014because my FluffButt isn't suffering anymore and is probably in an all-you-can eat vegetable buffet in hamster heaven\u2014and jealousy. Because he got out before I did. We were both suffering, while I have been suffering longer than he did, he just got out sooner.\n\nEveryone can see (and smell) that he was dying but nobody wants to help the little guy because \"that's how the world works\". Everyone can see (and smell, I suppose. I really let myself go these past few months) that I am dying, but nobody wants to help me because \"that's how the world works\".", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i3nen", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My hamster died three days ago", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i3nen", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7i3nen/my_hamster_died_three_days_ago/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512646333.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i3nen/my_hamster_died_three_days_ago/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "CaramelleCake", "created_utc": 1512617533.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I felt on top of things.

In high school it manifested in not getting good enough grades, not following fads or listening to the music on the top of the charts, and in general not finding any value in any of the other students around me. I don&amp;#39;t keep in contact with a single person from my graduating class. At 22, that apathy has formed into a complete disregard for any semblance of relationship, an inability to feel remorse, and a total lack of self-drive or goals for the future. I work a job that pays my rent and other expenditures just fine with enough leftover and that is plenty fine for me. The thought of further education or training is absolutely unappealing to me. It doesn&amp;#39;t make me anxious, I don&amp;#39;t fear the debt, nor do I find the prospect of school overwhelming, I just don&amp;#39;t care to have any interest in it. I feel an absolute disconnect from my fellow human. Growing up, I was the &amp;quot;weird kid&amp;quot; that tended to drift outside major social circles, and that was fine really. I had my handful of pals I could ride bikes with or play video games and that was fine. I never had any particular close friends, just some familiar faces when my hands became idle. Today, I still have a smaller social circle. My co-workers and I are all very chummy together and most of my social stimulation comes from a night at the bars, or a shared blunt in a basement. I have only about three people I actively seek to spend time with otherwise, with a tertiary &amp;quot;board game&amp;quot; circle I spend time with maybe once every month or two. The above described people make up the &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; that I have, but the ultimate truth is that I don&amp;#39;t particularly care about them. I don&amp;#39;t care about their health, their financial well being, nothing. I have said for years that all of my friends could vanish from life completely one day and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be bothered. That very thing seems to be happening now. Many people that were regularly apart of my life simply aren&amp;#39;t there anymore. It&amp;#39;s dozens in fact. All contact with several people came to a complete halt and I cannot be bothered to care or seek reconciliation of any kind. I almost see it as a blessing. Social interaction has always felt like a chore to me. I&amp;#39;ve always hated being asked questions in particular, because they always obligate a response of some kind. Even calling and visiting my own parents has become troublesome. I feel like my &amp;quot;liking&amp;quot; of particular people is just a strengthened version of tolerance. My mind always looks for the first reason to internally criticize or mistrust everyone I meet, even my family and close friends. I don&amp;#39;t feel any real connection with anyone. I don&amp;#39;t like the same things, don&amp;#39;t care for the same recreation; all of my interactions are just previously established actions that solicit a positive reaction. It&amp;#39;s as if there isn&amp;#39;t actually a KeeganB314 with his own personality, just an idea of one that&amp;#39;s strengthened through charade. I&amp;#39;ve even actively been doing wrong by the supposed people I care about, but that&amp;#39;s a long story in itself. Whenever I commit fault, I cannot come up with the proper emotions that would come from saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot; I can recognize when I&amp;#39;m doing something that&amp;#39;s wrong, and I have proper enough judgement as to not do those things, but again, I just don&amp;#39;t care. There are no feelings of shame, remorse, or catharsis; it is alien to me. This apathy has slowly become resentment to everything around me, and now it is beginning to become akin to long form torture.

I do not know if my internalizations are that of depression - if anything, it sounds more like anti-social personality disorder - but I&amp;#39;m really just hoping to be able to find some validation and guidance from anyone that suffers from the same cynical, apathetic slog of existence. I&amp;#39;ve always felt like this to some degree, being able to stave off the &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot;, but it would appear the loss of my younger brother earlier this year has strengthened these feelings tenfold over the past few months.

One moment she's yelling about how i am selfish and i should go get a job besides my school even though school is exhausting me, and the other moment she is like totally friendly to me which is so confusing, like she doesn't care about the fact i am diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

I\u2019ve always been somewhat depressed since about 13. But here\u2019s how my story goes: I started doing drugs when I was 16. It started with marijuana, occasionally. Then it quickly turned to smoking weed all day every day. Eventually, weed got kinda boring. So at the age of 16 i took a dose of LSD and loved it. Following that, I was introduced to Ecstasy and abused that for a week or two. Still smoking copious amounts of pot at this point. Also cigarettes got in there pretty quick. At 17, I was smoking weed all day every day and there was a period of about 3 weeks where I would take LSD every two days just for fun. Then LSD got boring, so I took a small break from that. During my break, I tried speed, DXM, mushrooms, MDA, and cocaine. I never really abused these drugs. But I did use them. Then i abused LSD. I took 2 double dosed hits (4 hits total). I didn\u2019t know they were double dosed. I had a horrifying trip. I thought was dead. Time became meaningless and infinite. It felt like I was part of some huge simulation, and nothing actually existed. It scared the hell out of me. So I took a long break from LSD. At this point in my story, I\u2019m 17. Still smoking weed everyday along with cigarettes, and occasionally coke and speed. Then I abused LSD again, and nearly ruined my social life. I made an hour long Snapchat story of me saying gibberish and nonsense, and I was waving my dick around and just generally acting insane on my Snapchat. A lot of my friends saw it. I was hugely embarrassed. Haven\u2019t done LSD Since. Next part of my life: I start my Senior year of highschool and turned 18 this past September. I slowed down on the weed smoking. But when the school year started, my depression starting kicking in hard. (I had depression all throughout my life, but most of the time drugs kept it away). But this time it came back with vengeance. So what do I do? Drugs. Not just any drugs. The &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; drugs to be addicted to. Benzos. There\u2019s a way you can order synthetic benzodiazepines online with just a credit card. &lt;strong&gt;You can buy as much as you want.&lt;/strong&gt; This is where things get bad. I started with Etizolam, a legal form of Xanax. It took away all my anxiety, and I fell in love with it. So I started taking absurd amounts of it, building a tolerance. Eventually Etizolam felt weak due to my tolerance. So I went online, and bought one of, if not, the most potent benzodiazepines on Earth. Clonazolam. (CLam for short). I bought 25 1mg pills. Typically, someone with no tolerance to benzos would take 1mg CLam and be knocked out for like 18 hours. But nope. Not me. Since my benzo tolerance was already jacked up due to Etizolam, I had no issues popping 3-4mg CLam a night. I\u2019ve been doing this for about a month now. Since this drug is legal and unscheduled, there is very little known about the side effects of it. One day, I went to work and forgot to dose my CLam. At work I was seeing things, I was paranoid, scared, tense, irritable, and in physical pain. At this point I realized my body &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; CLam to survive. All this was just a few days ago. Tomorrow I am getting more CLam to hold me over. Benzos are the worst drug to be hooked on, hands fucking down. And that was only 1 day of withdrawal. It gets worse the longer you go without dosing. So basically; I\u2019m a huge (functional) drug addict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I\u2019m gonna tell you what\u2019s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bothering me. Drug addiction is one thing. But this. This really takes the cake:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my close friends knew I was addicted to CLam, and referred me to the school counselor. Since she is a very close friend of mine, I took her advice, since she was only trying to help. I go to my school counselor. I Tell her everything I just mentioned above. The weed, Ecstasy, cocaine, benzos, etc. From all this, she concluded that I see a doctor and tell him about my heavy benzo addiction. So I did. I went to the doctor. But here\u2019s the fun part: I didn\u2019t go to the doctor for him to help me get off drugs. I went because I thought \u201cHey, I can get benzos legally from a doc! Screw getting clean!\u201d So I went to the doc, didn\u2019t tell him anything about my benzo/drug abuse. And he prescribed me Lexapro. I was disappointed, seeing as I thought I could get more benzos from my doc. But then I went back to my school counselor, and she asked how the Dr appointment went. I said \u201cit went great! I told him all about my abuse, and he\u2019s helping me get clean!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of fucking person am I? Who voluntarily goes to counseling to get clean from drugs, and then lies to the counselor AND the doctor?? I\u2019m still taking CLam to this day. I\u2019m on my afternoon dose right now. Yet, my counselor, my doctor, my friends, they all think I\u2019m getting my life together and staying away from drugs. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m still heavily addicted. And from what I\u2019ve researched, due to the potency of CLam, the withdrawals can easily be fatal. So let\u2019s say that the website I get CLam from gets shut down. I have no access to my benzos, and could literally die at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; moment if I\u2019m not on my CLam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel so awful. Not only am I heavily addicted to hard drugs, but I\u2019m an avid liar, manipulator, and a fiend. I have no good qualities. \nI can\u2019t even feel happiness anymore, the years of drugs have taken it all away. Even when I\u2019m on my CLam. It makes me somewhat content, but mostly it just numbs my depression and crushes my anxiety. I\u2019m a shell of a person I used to be before drugs. I remember feeling pleasure from simple things. Watching TV, taking a walk, cracking jokes with friends. But all of that is gone now. I wouldn\u2019t wish this upon my worst enemy. I\u2019m so young, yet my life has already been washed away from extreme drug abuse. I might as well just end it all. Maybe I\u2019ll stop taking CLam, and let the withdrawals kill me. Or take a fucken gun to my head. This is so awful. I\u2019m not even a human at this point. I\u2019m 6ft 2in, and I weigh 115lb. I\u2019m skin and bones, thanks to drugs. No girl wants me. My friends couldn\u2019t care less about my drug issue, besides the one or two that I lied to about getting clean. I don\u2019t even know what to think anymore. I just wanna disappear, or restart my life and avoid all the hell drugs have given me. I can never have what I want. Whether it be girls, friends, drugs that don\u2019t ruin me, or just happiness in general. At no point in my life did I ever think \u201cHey, my life is pretty good.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m living a nightmare. And I can\u2019t wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a reason they tell you not to do drugs in school. Because you\u2019ll end up like me. A husk of a person, with no ability to feel pleasure. But only pain, guilt, self hatred, and regret is all I can feel. I can\u2019t type this anymore. It makes me feel sick even admitting all of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t do drugs. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "WARNING: WALL OF TEXT\n\nI\u2019m an 18 yr old male. I\u2019ve always been somewhat depressed since about 13. But here\u2019s how my story goes: I started doing drugs when I was 16. It started with marijuana, occasionally. Then it quickly turned to smoking weed all day every day. Eventually, weed got kinda boring. So at the age of 16 i took a dose of LSD and loved it. Following that, I was introduced to Ecstasy and abused that for a week or two. Still smoking copious amounts of pot at this point. Also cigarettes got in there pretty quick. At 17, I was smoking weed all day every day and there was a period of about 3 weeks where I would take LSD every two days just for fun. Then LSD got boring, so I took a small break from that. During my break, I tried speed, DXM, mushrooms, MDA, and cocaine. I never really abused these drugs. But I did use them. Then i abused LSD. I took 2 double dosed hits (4 hits total). I didn\u2019t know they were double dosed. I had a horrifying trip. I thought was dead. Time became meaningless and infinite. It felt like I was part of some huge simulation, and nothing actually existed. It scared the hell out of me. So I took a long break from LSD. At this point in my story, I\u2019m 17. Still smoking weed everyday along with cigarettes, and occasionally coke and speed. Then I abused LSD again, and nearly ruined my social life. I made an hour long Snapchat story of me saying gibberish and nonsense, and I was waving my dick around and just generally acting insane on my Snapchat. A lot of my friends saw it. I was hugely embarrassed. Haven\u2019t done LSD Since. Next part of my life: I start my Senior year of highschool and turned 18 this past September. I slowed down on the weed smoking. But when the school year started, my depression starting kicking in hard. (I had depression all throughout my life, but most of the time drugs kept it away). But this time it came back with vengeance. So what do I do? Drugs. Not just any drugs. The *worst* drugs to be addicted to. Benzos.

I remember laying in bed at the hotel and actually looking up if I could OD on the Advil or w.e meds we had at the time. Was able to talk myself out of it and just wait till I got home, didn&amp;#39;t want to make my parents have to deal with getting my body back to the east cost. Told myself to just chill out for now and go to bed. Then the next thing I know I&amp;#39;m being woken up to the police and flashlights in my face.

This also makes things worse, because I feel like I have no one to talk to. She suggested writing everything out on paper, and honestly that helped me for like a day. Now here I am at 12:30am sitting in the living room because I needed to isolate myself. Couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to tell her how I was really feeling, because I felt that she would just shut down in that situation.

And here&amp;#39;s the worst part : They crack jokes about depressed people....and I laugh. Sometimes I join in. I feel like shit because of that. I already cant talk to anyone because of that.

I&amp;#39;ve been hospitalized for it 3 times, and at the time of this, I&amp;#39;m 15, and two of them have happened in the same year. Not good. I&amp;#39;ve tried different meds, like Seroquel, which I have 400MG for. I&amp;#39;ve been contemplating suicide alot. But I feel like I&amp;#39;ve just been becoming a hollow shell of myself. I dont know who I am, or what I&amp;#39;m gonna do. I&amp;#39;ve tried stuff like sports, but it hasn&amp;#39;t worked. I&amp;#39;ve been raped before. And I make jokes about that too. I&amp;#39;m an evil cunt. A horrible son of a bitch. I deserve to die. I&amp;#39;ve done drugs before, yet I critisize others for it. I&amp;#39;m a joke. A hypocrite.

She really really liked me and I led her to believe something false. Fuck. I&amp;#39;ve been abused before, but I&amp;#39;ve hit my sisters a couple times. Although it was never too frequent, I know I am a shitbag. I&amp;#39;ve punched, smacked and hit them. Females. I&amp;#39;ve stolen from my mother and have hidden money from her when everyone else was starving.

Although I definitely have traumas regarding my dad, my lows aren&amp;#39;t usually caused by that, which feels harder because I don&amp;#39;t have a particular area that I could just fix/work on to rid me of my current depressive state. I&amp;#39;ve been out of school for three weeks and in bed for that same time since I&amp;#39;m incapable of getting work done and keeping on a normal schedule due to no motivation. My hobbies which usually help me have just become a source of stress because I&amp;#39;m so unhappy doing anything that requires energy. I feel constantly drained and I sleep most of the day and when I can&amp;#39;t sleep I take sleeping pills or distract myself with tv so I don&amp;#39;t go deeper and possibly do something irreversible on impulse. I know that it will eventually pass, but sometimes lows like this last for months before I get back to my normal depression or even a high ( I might have bipolar depression, still in the watching/tracking process)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but I&amp;#39;m tired of feeling like I&amp;#39;m controlled by my depression and just waiting on things to just randomly change cycles, because I feel like it&amp;#39;s fucking up my potential and current standings regarding graduation and other plans for the future if I have one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actively seeking help but my options just keep getting fewer and fewer. I&amp;#39;ve gone through 7 different medications which haven&amp;#39;t worked and am starting this week on a new one. I&amp;#39;m also going into Dialectic Behavioral Therapy which apparently helps with coping skills- but I&amp;#39;m also on the fence with that because I don&amp;#39;t want to just cope and learn to live/function with my depression, I want to actually be happy.

Although I definitely have traumas regarding my dad, my lows aren't usually caused by that, which feels harder because I don't have a particular area that I could just fix/work on to rid me of my current depressive state. I've been out of school for three weeks and in bed for that same time since I'm incapable of getting work done and keeping on a normal schedule due to no motivation. My hobbies which usually help me have just become a source of stress because I'm so unhappy doing anything that requires energy. I feel constantly drained and I sleep most of the day and when I can't sleep I take sleeping pills or distract myself with tv so I don't go deeper and possibly do something irreversible on impulse. I know that it will eventually pass, but sometimes lows like this last for months before I get back to my normal depression or even a high ( I might have bipolar depression, still in the watching/tracking process)\n\n\n but I'm tired of feeling like I'm controlled by my depression and just waiting on things to just randomly change cycles, because I feel like it's fucking up my potential and current standings regarding graduation and other plans for the future if I have one.\n\n\nI'm actively seeking help but my options just keep getting fewer and fewer. I've gone through 7 different medications which haven't worked and am starting this week on a new one. I'm also going into Dialectic Behavioral Therapy which apparently helps with coping skills- but I'm also on the fence with that because I don't want to just cope and learn to live/function with my depression, I want to actually be happy. I'm worried that none of it will work because I've been actively trying for about 2 years now. Maybe I'm just impatient?\n\n\nI have my mom supporting me (although I feel extremely guilty for holding her back and worrying her) and in no way am I alone, but my experience feels lonesome and pretty hopeless.

I live in a trailer home with them and my soon to be ex wife. I had a good job as an insurance auditor. My life was not bad, I had family, a good job and beautiful kids, but life was very stressful as both my kids are very young and my wife was not working. I suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks. Sometimes these issues are caused by stress, sometimes they come from no where. I had been feeling more depressed than ever in my life in the past recent months. I lost my motivation to get out of bed, performance dropped at work, I didn&amp;#39;t want to do chores around the house or go grocery shopping. I expressed that I had some sort of problem to my wife wanting her affection and support. I just needed someone to listen and be there for me. But she had a very practical approach to this. She told me well we just need to fix it and get you help. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain how I felt about that. I didn&amp;#39;t want to hear I needed to be &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; I just wanted a caring and supportive shoulder to lean on. But she had a very low tolerance for my decrease in attitude, personality, and motivation. And understandably so. I was a mess and not doing anything around the house and not doing well at work. I wasn&amp;#39;t even interacting with my kids as much as I should have been. I was just very tired of the basic stresses of being young with so much responsibility and not a lot of money. And being the sole earner for my whole family. Anyway, long story short, I lost my job, and the very next day my car broke down. This sent my depression and anxiety into overdrive. The next few weeks were some of the worst of my life and I ended up attempting to take my own life. I&amp;#39;m glad I was not successful. I need to be here for my kids. But my wife decided to divorce me after that. It was too much for her to handle.\nI am doing a little better now. I checked myself into a psychiatric ward and got help. I am on meds and seeing a therapist regularly now. But my insurance I was getting through my job has now ended. I used all of my savings to buy a car. since my old one broke down (engine failure). Now I can&amp;#39;t afford my meds or my therapy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I already have a job offer. But the job does not start until Jan 15th. And I won&amp;#39;t get paid until 2 weeks after that. I need money in the interim very badly. I currently still live with my ex wife but our lease is up at the end of the month. I have friends who are also moving soon and we have planned to move in together and they will let me have my kids over when it is my turn with them. But I need rent money and my share of the deposit to pay to them. And I need food and basic necessities. I have been doing odd jobs on craigslist and mowing lawns and things like that. But it is just not enough. I am terrified of not being able to pull my own weight and letting my friends down. I will also have to start paying child support soon. If I can&amp;#39;t afford rent I will be homeless, if that happens or I can&amp;#39;t afford child support, my ex will be super pissed and I will lose my kids altogether. Since I have mental illness and tried to kill myself, my ex can very easily get the courts to approve only monitored visits every other week for an hour or so. I can&amp;#39;t do that. I need my kids in my life. They are the one and only thing keeping me tied to this life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions that might help me out?

I need money in the interim very badly. I currently still live with my ex wife but our lease is up at the end of the month. I have friends who are also moving soon and we have planned to move in together and they will let me have my kids over when it is my turn with them. But I need rent money and my share of the deposit to pay to them. And I need food and basic necessities. I have been doing odd jobs on craigslist and mowing lawns and things like that. But it is just not enough. I am terrified of not being able to pull my own weight and letting my friends down. I will also have to start paying child support soon. If I can't afford rent I will be homeless, if that happens or I can't afford child support, my ex will be super pissed and I will lose my kids altogether. Since I have mental illness and tried to kill myself, my ex can very easily get the courts to approve only monitored visits every other week for an hour or so. I can't do that. I need my kids in my life. They are the one and only thing keeping me tied to this life.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions that might help me out? I have a job lined up but I need money faster. My credit is not great so I can't get approved for a loan. I've already sold my Xbox and a lot of my stuff. I just don't know what to do.\n\nThanks for listening.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i3uw5", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Seeking advice trying to get my life back together", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i3uw5", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7i3uw5/seeking_advice_trying_to_get_my_life_back_together/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512648479.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i3uw5/seeking_advice_trying_to_get_my_life_back_together/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Visirion", "created_utc": 1512619679.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m breaking down, I swear that I&amp;#39;m going crazy.

Maybe my problems aren\u2018t real problems at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had something like mental break down in front of big number of people. It started so unexpected. From an early morning, the same second I woke up, I felt like something switched in me. Usually I\u2018m really friendly, happy and optimistic person, that is always in a good mood and likes to cheer up other people. This morning I woke up annoyed and unhappy, like all joy of the world dissapeared in front of my eyes. My instinct said, that I need medicine (I use easy nerves-calming pills every day and night, just that I could live with myself), sadly, I didn\u2018t had any. I tried to calm myself down looking at my reflection in the mirror. \u201eEverything is fine. You are fine. Just try to survive this day.\u201c As I whispered these sentences over and over again, for a second I thought, that I will survive. It\u2018s only 5 hours, and I\u2018ll be back at home, in my safe place. As I already mentioned, I wasn\u2018t fine. I had to go to the doctor, but before that I was triggered by a talk with my mother in a car. She didn\u2018t say anything bad. My mind did. So I flew out of the car without \u201egoodbye\u201c, went to the hospital and tried to calm myself once again. I tried going to the bathroom, but after one minute of locking myself in, someone would try to open bathrooms door. I couldn\u2018t find peaceful place in a full of people hospital... All that time I tried to talk to my bf and he couldn\u2018t really help me. He suggested some rational thoughts, but I was in emotionaly unstable place and rational thinking triggered me even more. I walked back and forth crying my eyes out for 2 hours straight. Only after I found silent place and eventualy calmed myself. My cheecks were completely red, like irritated, because of crying, my face was swolen and I didn\u2018t had energy at all. It was my first time of having such a strong mental break down in such a bussy place. I had couple of similar situations at home, only they ended with me not being able to talk physicaly for about 10 hours, but, the positive side is that I could be alone, in silence and try to slowly rebuild myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2018s hard to describe my feelings, but I\u2018ll try. It feels like my brain changes. I feel lost, distant from the world, issolated, even if there are caring people around me, scared, extreemly emotional.. I feel sadness, similar to grieving, like I would be grieving of lost life. At these moments I feel like no one understands me, even if I try to explain. And my mind is always talking with me. I don\u2018t hear my inside voice, but I feel it all the time. Voice says I\u2018m wothless, I\u2018m nothing, I will never reach my goals, I\u2018m a burdain to others, no one can or should love me, that everything is my fault and so much more. Sometimes the voice isn\u2018t talking, but expressing everything with waves of emotions. I can\u2018t stop this. All the sentences are  coming and going all at once again and again, like glitching mix of couple of recordings (it\u2018s really hard to explain). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2018t have suicidal thoughts. I don\u2018t want to do anything bad to myself, as I was thought that it is egoistic to leave loved people like this (I doubt that it\u2018s the best description for suicide, but it is engraved in my brain when I think about it). But I do think that I\u2018m tired of life. I don\u2018t want to die, but if everything would dissapear without any couse it would be easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a rough childhood with a lot of comparing myself to other family members, envy, thoughts, that no body loves me or remembers me, that I\u2018m not important to anyone. I had to live throug mother having cancer, firstly having toxic friends, then not having friends in school at all, a couple of really toxic and destructive relationships, little brothers fight with cancer, really hard studies (when you\u2018re sleeping for 4 hours max a day, for about 2 weeks)... Not so long ago my beloved dog died and she was replaced with another one so soon... That broke me. And when I thought that the worst had happened, in summer camp with my university classmates, one girl started to actively talk behind my back, she tried to humiliate me in front of really important people in my profession. After I tried to talk with her, I couldn\u2018t take the pressure and I ran into the unknown forest at night, when the wind and rain were really hard and I just walked for 3 hours. I came back to the camp completely wet and feeling like a different person. It felt like rain soaked into my soul. That\u2018s when everything got extreemly bad. After last summer I was on those calming pills almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of books about self love, how to control my emotions, think more positive and it works for some time, but after - everything gets wors. It seems like my mind is always attacing me and that it turns on the same movie over and over again: all my mistakes, bad things in my life.. sometimes I even have severe paranoia, that I can\u2018t sleep without bright lights that lights up every corner of my room. I never feel safe..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am writing all my thoughts every day and when I read my diary it seems, that I\u2018m stuck in one long nightmare that I created myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have some suggestions how I can overcome these issues? Maybe you have something similar? I would appretiate every comment..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S Sorry for the long post. Also, I didn\u2018t know what subreddit was best for this kind of stuff.

It seems like my mind is always attacing me and that it turns on the same movie over and over again: all my mistakes, bad things in my life.. sometimes I even have severe paranoia, that I can\u2018t sleep without bright lights that lights up every corner of my room. I never feel safe..\n\nI am writing all my thoughts every day and when I read my diary it seems, that I\u2018m stuck in one long nightmare that I created myself. \n\nMaybe you have some suggestions how I can overcome these issues? Maybe you have something similar? I would appretiate every comment..\n\nP.S Sorry for the long post. Also, I didn\u2018t know what subreddit was best for this kind of stuff. Hope I\u2018m in a right place.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i1fno", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Had mental break-down in a public place.

It&amp;#39;s a pretty long post, because I don&amp;#39;t know where else to turn to or share this with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Screwed up what seemed to be a great career opportunity. I feel like my breakdowns and struggles are from my own doing, and only I can help myself. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just depressed, but maybe that&amp;#39;s just an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just recently graduated college with flying colors, and I&amp;#39;m now working in a company with a great reputation. On my 4th month now. Pay&amp;#39;s good. Culture&amp;#39;s good. People are great. A lot of experience and learning to gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, sometime between late 2nd month to 3rd month, I&amp;#39;ve been having moments wherein there&amp;#39;s a mixture of envy, guilt, regret, and anger. When I look at my results as of my 3rd month, I can&amp;#39;t help but feel disappointed. I feel that if I were to look at my college self, I know that that person would achieve so much more. A bit perfectionist, OC, strong and independent, sure, but I know that person would go above and beyond. But I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that I&amp;#39;m not embodying that person anymore, and it frustrates me so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I compare myself to my peers. They have a different type of job role, but I sometimes feel envious that they seem to be bringing out results more quickly than I do. Or I get envious that their work is more enjoyable. I would say that my job role is quite challenging for my MBTI type. It&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;opposite&amp;#39; of my natural personality. It has a lot to do with emotional resilience and communication, areas that throw me out of my comfort zone. But I took the role nonetheless, because I know that overcoming these would take me far, so even if there are uncomfortable moments, I bear them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come my performance review on my 3rd month, I delivered what I consider to be a catastrophic presentation. There were results, but I struggled to answer the Q&amp;amp;A portion. It showed how I lacked knowledge in my area. This was a big blow to my confidence, and I had an emotional breakdown later that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks before that presentation, I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with an emotional breakdown as well. I don&amp;#39;t have problems with family or friends. I think it&amp;#39;s mostly me being the problem--being vigilant of any mistakes or shortcomings, what I consider to be poor time management (procrastinating leading to bad moods. Bad moods leading to procrastination), caving in to the pressure of being expected to do more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometime before my first breakdown, I was in a &amp;quot;spiral.&amp;quot; I work morning till late evening, and I admit sacrificing my sleep. Adding to my frustration is how I seem to be more sleep deprived back during my college days, but I still managed to be enthusiastic and fight on. Here, sometimes I dread and just want to get the week over with. There&amp;#39;s a heavy feeling on my chest. I told myself to get some more sleep, which I did successfully for a couple of days. But now I&amp;#39;ve slipped back to the spiral, because I&amp;#39;m lagging behind my deliverables, and I&amp;#39;m getting increasingly worried if I don&amp;#39;t catch up (yes, voluntarily working on weekends), I might not make it through my final review. I took some of those depression tests online, and I&amp;#39;d say I exhibit the symptoms (e.g. appetite changes, lack of sleep, irritability, mood swings, loss of enjoyment, visualizing &lt;em&gt;accidents&lt;/em&gt; happening me). But every time I have those breakdowns, I suddenly feel better again in the next few days. I notice that I break down again around every 2 weeks. Talk about emotional peaks and valleys. Now, I belive I&amp;#39;m experiencing my 3rd one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For my final review, it&amp;#39;s expected that you close some iniatives mentioned back in your first review. Aside from base work and those initial initiatives, you have to do more than what&amp;#39;s mentioned. I indeed am doing my base work, but I&amp;#39;m running out of ideas on how to &amp;quot;do more.&amp;quot; There have been several iniatives laid out till my final performance review, but I was told those aren&amp;#39;t enough. Furthermore, a lot of those iniatives were assigned to me (aka my boss and buddy&amp;#39;s ideas), and I have to come up with initiatives of my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the tension of wanting to shut down and quit. At the same time, there&amp;#39;s tension that quitting is not an option, because it would be a huge disappointment and embarassment to my family and friends. They believe that my first performance review went spectularly well, and it would crush them (and me) for them to know that that wasn&amp;#39;t the case. Only my boss knows about my 1st and 2nd breakdowns (of all people and times, I just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to break down to this person). I was told I&amp;#39;m incredibly self-aware, and that&amp;#39;s my strength. I think I do, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how much longer I can keep up living like this. I don&amp;#39;t want to be &amp;quot;that new hire that keeps on breaking down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that my employer deserves this kind of burden. I feel like I&amp;#39;m a ticking time bomb who would fail to get regularized; it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time (1 month&amp;#39;s time, to be exact). Today, I even called in sick to avoid giving a presentation (which I&amp;#39;m still not prepared for even after 2 opportunity days of prep time, because of my breakdown). The audience is just 1 person though, but still, it&amp;#39;s so not like me. My spiritual faith has pretty much dwindled. I&amp;#39;m not sure if anyone else can help me get back on track, because I feel like all these struggles are from my own doing, and it&amp;#39;s only I who can help myself. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just depressed, but maybe that&amp;#39;s just an excuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time I felt like this was when I was bullied back in high school. Almost 8 years ago. I managed to overcome that without taking meds or taking to a psychologist or telling my family (I don&amp;#39;t want to shock them and I think their reponses would be along the lines of, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s just life.&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;Life is hard.&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll get over this.&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re worrying too much.&amp;quot;) or ever hurting myself. It surprises me that of all times to have a relapse(?), it had to me now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Struggling here, so would be nice to get some perspective. It's a pretty long post, because I don't know where else to turn to or share this with.\n\nTLDR: Screwed up what seemed to be a great career opportunity. I feel like my breakdowns and struggles are from my own doing, and only I can help myself. Maybe I'm just depressed, but maybe that's just an excuse.\n\nI just recently graduated college with flying colors, and I'm now working in a company with a great reputation. On my 4th month now. Pay's good. Culture's good. People are great. A lot of experience and learning to gain.\n\nHowever, sometime between late 2nd month to 3rd month, I've been having moments wherein there's a mixture of envy, guilt, regret, and anger. When I look at my results as of my 3rd month, I can't help but feel disappointed. I feel that if I were to look at my college self, I know that that person would achieve so much more. A bit perfectionist, OC, strong and independent, sure, but I know that person would go above and beyond. But I can't help but feel that I'm not embodying that person anymore, and it frustrates me so much.\n\nSometimes I compare myself to my peers. They have a different type of job role, but I sometimes feel envious that they seem to be bringing out results more quickly than I do. Or I get envious that their work is more enjoyable. I would say that my job role is quite challenging for my MBTI type. It's 'opposite' of my natural personality. It has a lot to do with emotional resilience and communication, areas that throw me out of my comfort zone. But I took the role nonetheless, because I know that overcoming these would take me far, so even if there are uncomfortable moments, I bear them anyway.\n\nCome my performance review on my 3rd month, I delivered what I consider to be a catastrophic presentation. There were results, but I struggled to answer the Q&amp;A portion. It showed how I lacked knowledge in my area. This was a big blow to my confidence, and I had an emotional breakdown later that day.\n\nTwo weeks before that presentation, I've been dealing with an emotional breakdown as well. I don't have problems with family or friends. I think it's mostly me being the problem--being vigilant of any mistakes or shortcomings, what I consider to be poor time management (procrastinating leading to bad moods. Bad moods leading to procrastination), caving in to the pressure of being expected to do more.\n\nSometime before my first breakdown, I was in a \"spiral.\" I work morning till late evening, and I admit sacrificing my sleep. Adding to my frustration is how I seem to be more sleep deprived back during my college days, but I still managed to be enthusiastic and fight on. Here, sometimes I dread and just want to get the week over with. There's a heavy feeling on my chest. I told myself to get some more sleep, which I did successfully for a couple of days. But now I've slipped back to the spiral, because I'm lagging behind my deliverables, and I'm getting increasingly worried if I don't catch up (yes, voluntarily working on weekends), I might not make it through my final review. I took some of those depression tests online, and I'd say I exhibit the symptoms (e.g. appetite changes, lack of sleep, irritability, mood swings, loss of enjoyment, visualizing *accidents* happening me). But every time I have those breakdowns, I suddenly feel better again in the next few days. I notice that I break down again around every 2 weeks. Talk about emotional peaks and valleys. Now, I belive I'm experiencing my 3rd one.\n\nFor my final review, it's expected that you close some iniatives mentioned back in your first review. Aside from base work and those initial initiatives, you have to do more than what's mentioned. I indeed am doing my base work, but I'm running out of ideas on how to \"do more.\" There have been several iniatives laid out till my final performance review, but I was told those aren't enough. Furthermore, a lot of those iniatives were assigned to me (aka my boss and buddy's ideas), and I have to come up with initiatives of my own.\n\nThere's the tension of wanting to shut down and quit. At the same time, there's tension that quitting is not an option, because it would be a huge disappointment and embarassment to my family and friends. They believe that my first performance review went spectularly well, and it would crush them (and me) for them to know that that wasn't the case. Only my boss knows about my 1st and 2nd breakdowns (of all people and times, I just *had* to break down to this person). I was told I'm incredibly self-aware, and that's my strength. I think I do, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep up living like this. I don't want to be \"that new hire that keeps on breaking down.\"\n\nI don't think that my employer deserves this kind of burden. I feel like I'm a ticking time bomb who would fail to get regularized; it's only a matter of time (1 month's time, to be exact). Today, I even called in sick to avoid giving a presentation (which I'm still not prepared for even after 2 opportunity days of prep time, because of my breakdown). The audience is just 1 person though, but still, it's so not like me. My spiritual faith has pretty much dwindled. I'm not sure if anyone else can help me get back on track, because I feel like all these struggles are from my own doing, and it's only I who can help myself. Maybe I'm just depressed, but maybe that's just an excuse.\n\nThe last time I felt like this was when I was bullied back in high school. Almost 8 years ago. I managed to overcome that without taking meds or taking to a psychologist or telling my family (I don't want to shock them and I think their reponses would be along the lines of, \"That's just life.\"/\"Life is hard.\"/\"You'll get over this.\"/\"You're worrying too much.\") or ever hurting myself.

Because of what happened in the summer with R, I can\u2019t help but be constantly paranoid that K will do the same. I feel more of a connection with K. However, that\u2019s what will make losing her even harder than R if on the off-chance it does happen. I feel constantly worried that she\u2019s either going to leave me because of my looks or personality, body or otherwise, or because she\u2019ll find someone better than me. I\u2019m so scared that she\u2019ll want something different. I\u2019ve had issues with anxiety, depression and self harm for the last 4 years, and she\u2019s the first person who\u2019s actually been able to help me. I simply cannot lose her, but my paranoia is just simply screaming at me that I will. \n\nI\u2019d move mountains for this girl. She\u2019s so pretty, and always has guys messaging her and complimenting her on her looks, which does make me a little jealous sometimes, as it would, but i just don\u2019t know what to do honestly... I\u2019ve tried so hard to ignore the paranoid thoughts, and just live in this moment, and enjoy it. But I can\u2019t help but think that it\u2019ll be a repeat of the R situation, which I think would honestly kill me...

I am not sure what i felt -???Anxiety attack??? )and the thoughts felt so real like I am feeling the same way, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. I was relatively fine. I was sleepy. As I was smoking I suddently looked in the place where we are keeping the knives and imagined getting a knife and s...... I got intense strike in the stomach and like an urge to do it, it felt real. Then I tried to calm my self but the thought &amp;quot;Life is meaningless&amp;quot; with somekind of weird ??future?? feeling came. The strike in the stomach became more intense, I immediately went to my room. I was no longer sleeping, and started googling about suicidal thoughts/suicidality.\nToday I woke up with low mood and the pictures of yesterday stuck in my head, with a weird stomach feeling.\nAlso while I am writing this there is a feeling/thoughts that I just don&amp;#39;t want to admit it. And a confusion if I am suicidal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to a psychiatrist, and told him about the throughts. He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much symptoms of depression.\nBut I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can&amp;#39;t tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don&amp;#39;t. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don&amp;#39;t get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF?\nAlso when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can&amp;#39;t ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don&amp;#39;t want to get better makes me more terrified. Does that sound like Active SI?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,\u00a0no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don&amp;#39;t think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime i post on reddit i feel like i missed something....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell if these thoughts/feelings are intrusive or I am actually suicidal/suicidal depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I sound suicidal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,\u00a0have a good night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello\u00a0reddit!\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY.\n\nFirst of all I am 19 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family.

WTF?\nAlso when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can't ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don't want to get better makes me more terrified. Does that sound like Active SI?\n\nAnd many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.\n\nI visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,\u00a0no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.\n\nEverytime i post on reddit i feel like i missed something....\n\nI can't tell if these thoughts/feelings are intrusive or I am actually suicidal/suicidal depressed.\n\nDo I sound suicidal?\n\nThanks in advance,\u00a0have a good night.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hygup", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Does this sound like suicidal depression?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 19, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hygup", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7hygup/does_this_sound_like_suicidal_depression/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512600282.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7hygup/does_this_sound_like_suicidal_depression/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "lostminddd", "created_utc": 1512571482.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I originally posted this to &lt;a href=\"/r/bipolar\"&gt;r/bipolar&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn&amp;#39;t see that there is a 30 day timer before you can post.

I ended up going on a 14 week medical leave from work to attend a partial hospitalization/intensive outpatient program. Truthfully, I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I was ready to go back to work, but being out of work was incredibly punishing financially, even with disability benefits and putting in freezes to my bills for &amp;quot;financial hardship.&amp;quot; My SO was essentially singlehandedly supporting the two of us and it felt awful. He was doing his best not to push me, but the guilt was overwhelming. I was discharged on a Friday and went back to work on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway...this is where I&amp;#39;m at now. A little over a year later, still feeling like I haven&amp;#39;t made any progress. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve given up, like I&amp;#39;m physically crippled from apathy sometimes. I haven&amp;#39;t seen my mom in 4 months and counting. I skipped out on the wake and funeral of a family member. I bailed on Thanksgiving dinner with my SO&amp;#39;s family at the very last minute, like an hour before we had to be there. I know that I look like a total asshole, but I can&amp;#39;t...care? Anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also been affecting my job worse than it ever has. I literally don&amp;#39;t even show up to the office until 11am, 12pm, 1pm, every day. Sometimes I don&amp;#39;t even show up at all. My manager brought to my attention that I hadn&amp;#39;t even worked 20 hours for 2 weeks in a row at one point and he wasn&amp;#39;t sure if he could depend on me to handle my own responsibilities anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my credit, last week I tried harder. I dragged myself in every day, even if it was an hour or two late. I worked my hardest. I met all of my deadlines. I followed up with all of my clients. But my manager called me into his office again on Monday and said that my attitude has been awful and &amp;quot;if you cant control your emotions, I&amp;#39;d rather you just stay home.&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t even take that gracefully. I cried in his office right in front of him. It was humiliating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a loss. I took a mental health day yesterday to recuperate but now it&amp;#39;s 10am and I haven&amp;#39;t even left my bed, even though I&amp;#39;ve been awake for three hours. I know I&amp;#39;m fucking up. I know my company&amp;#39;s patience can only stretch so thin. I feel like I should be terrified of losing my job, but I&amp;#39;m not, and that terrifies me in turn. I just came down from the most destructive hypomanic episode of my life. I blew through thousands of dollars, got three spontaneous walk-in tattoos in three days when I&amp;#39;ve never even had tattoos beforehand, bought an expensive MacBook that I don&amp;#39;t need, etc etc etc. Last week I had another fit of hypomania and got another tattoo on a whim, and it made me not able to pay my full half of the rent. Like...what the fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist keeps telling me to just &amp;quot;wait it out, be positive&amp;quot; while he keeps fiddling with my cocktail of meds trying to jumpstart my brain back into normalcy, but I feel like he&amp;#39;s frustrated with me at this point and to be honest? I&amp;#39;m frustrated with myself. This week I told him about the apathy and everything I wrote here pretty much, and he just upped my Adderall which does nothing to motivate me, although it does help me focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I...don&amp;#39;t even know how to close this out.

So, while I still feel relatively ok, I&amp;#39;m going to set myself a reminder here for when the real pain kicks in to not quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My whole entire life, I&amp;#39;m almost 19, I&amp;#39;ve struggled with horrible teeth. Just last year I made a post on &lt;a href=\"/r/dentistry\"&gt;r/dentistry&lt;/a&gt; looking for advice on how I can fix my teeth because I thought they were &amp;quot;horrible.&amp;quot; I look back on that and I see something I fucking wish I had today. Even if my teeth then were really bad compared to a normal person, they were still infinitely better than what I have now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teeth is almost kind of a taboo subject. People get all embarrassed talking about bad teeth and such. But have you ever considered living with them? I&amp;#39;ve got to have nearing 10 cavities in my mouth just waiting to kill me, and there&amp;#39;s not a fucking thing I can do about it. My family is bordering lower class. We live in the bad part of town. I go to one of the worst schools in the state. Everyday I go to a school where fights happen daily and people are constantly talking crap to the teachers and passing drugs in the bathrooms. My family cant afford to fix my mouth. They think I just have normal discolored or yellow teeth but it only proves to me they have no idea what is really going on with them. I cant just go out to them and say &amp;quot;Hey, can we go to the dentist&amp;#39;s and get me a new set of teeth.&amp;quot; (I&amp;#39;m going to need dentures no doubt, 90% of my teeth are fucked.) We literally cant afford to do it. It costs thousands and thousands of dollars that we dont have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bisexual male and I have a boyfriend I confessed to a month ago. We love each other past the Moon and the stars. It was one of the proudest moments in my life and everyday I go to school and I&amp;#39;m proud that I can call someone my significant other whom I want to spend the rest of my life with because he has helped me crawl out of the depths of depression. But what kind of boyfriend am I? Someone who can&amp;#39;t smile because he&amp;#39;s too fucking embarrassed my boyfriend will get harassed for dating someone with such a fucked up mouth. I put tons of work into making the outside of myself look decent at least, but every moment of every day I&amp;#39;m reminded how shit it all is because it&amp;#39;s all contrasted to this curse I carry and cannot get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why... it wont break me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My entire elementary and middle school career I was teased and mocked. I had trash hurled at me every day in art class. I would have to run home, because if I was caught outside of school when school got out, some dickhead bully would chase me down and beat me up on the side of the road while the people sat and watched in their cars. I had a girlfriend who was suicidal and I would have to watch her get mocked and laughed at alongside me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, the one time in my life when thing&amp;#39;s are starting to look better and I have someone I WANT to go to school for to see everyday and to make happy and spend the rest of my life with, life throws me this. It threw me this final curse at birth. It knew I was going to overcome the obstacles it gave me, trying to crush me beneath it&amp;#39;s lead boots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You look into my burning eyes and say to my face, Life, that this will break me. I don&amp;#39;t care how much pain you decide to give me over the next few years. I dont care if I wake up tomorrow and every single fucking cavity in my mouth decides it want&amp;#39;s to act up and bring me to my knees. I&amp;#39;ll remember what you&amp;#39;ve done and why I&amp;#39;ll bring my knee up and stand on my feet. Because I have to go and make the only person in my life who has given me the time of day and who loves me happy.

Since i started school at 7 i had been bullied on and off for my ginger hair (and probably because i was not into sports etc like the other kids). Somehow i managed to find a girlfriend, let&amp;#39;s call her Brenda. At this point in my life i really thought everything was changing for the better, i had been on and off depressed during my whole school experience. Unfortunately Brenda became more and more controlling and i was not allowed to have friends of the opposite sex, spend time with my male friends whenever she wanted to hang out, checked my email, my phone etc. This started to become a big issue around the time when i was 18 or 19 at some point it got to the point where i would make up stories or lie about  something i just had to do on say a weekend to be able to play videogames and eat pizza. The lies were of varying character and i justified it by telling myself over and over that it was the only way i could get some alone time for myself to do what i wanted. The weight on my shoulders became more heavy with each lie and my university studies at this point suffered. I tried breaking up with Brenda several times, i think 3 in total, when i tried she would call me, cry and walk out in the forest and tell me she was going to kill herself. No matter what i did i could not escape the crumbling weight of failing studies, being financially ruined ( in Sweden we get financial support from the government which you loose if you fail too many classes). I started receiving letters on bills i could not pay etc. Things were to the point where i was about to get homeless, and i was too proud to ask my parents for help. At the end of 2010 my mind totally flipped and i had a breakdown, my parents found out i had no money and couldn&amp;#39;t pay my rent, somehow during all this i just thought to myself &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot; and i told Brenda via a text message i never wanted to see her again and she should never contact me or my friends/family again and never picked the phone up again whenever she called. It felt horrible to do this to another human being whom i had loved greatly during the years we were together. I still to this day feel like shit for the way i treated her. Somehow after that relationship ended i dont even remember exactly how or why but i fell in love with a girl, let&amp;#39;s call her Shaniqua, i knew from the start i was hopelessly in love with her, i had never felt the same about anyone else before. She could, and can still make me smile just by me remembering her face. The first year with Shaniqua was great, but i got the same controlling vibes as i got with Brenda and down the road i made one mistake. I used a stupid lie because i again needed some time for myself. She found out immediately, it was impossible to lie to this girl because she would find out instantly, no idea how, she just did. This of course made her behavior worse because she felt she could not trust me. I totally get that and blame myself. The next 4 or 5 years i spent a lot of time trying to rebuild trust with Shaniqua, i never hid anything, i was very open with what i did etc. But after that first lie she never really wanted to put any effort in our relationship. This continued until 2014 when my mother died of cancer, i had known she had cancer for about 2 - 3 years at that point and it came as a huge surprise, she went from good to really bad in one month, the cancer had spread to her brain. After her death i fell down deep into the black void again and i think this was the only time Shaniqua REALLY supported me. She was great, she was very patient and helped me a lot. Around the start of 2015 i think she started to feel depressed, i think there was a lot of pressure from her university studies and i tried to support her, she became very cold towards me and at times very angry. And then i made the second big mistake in that relationship, i talked to some of my colleagues about this, maybe i was whining a bit to them because i sometimes felt like i was the only one trying to make our relationship work (in hindsight this was extremely selfish and stupid). Anyway, as i said before, it is impossible to keep anything from this girl so naturally she found this out and that was the equivalent of me cheating on her. Which lead to her throwing me out of our apartment. I got lucky and was able to rent a room from a colleague at work until i could find my own place which i did in august of 2016, i have been living there since then. There are many things not said here and i guess things might seem very simplified from just a wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been working at my current job since the start of 2016, it&amp;#39;s a very high pressure job with a manager that sucks at his job. When things are good the reason is of course his good leadership, when things go bad he throws people under the bus. So for two years i have been under a lot of stress, it has started to affect my sleep, i don&amp;#39;t feel rested when i wake up a few days of the week, especially  end of the week before the weekend. Right now im in the process of finding a new job but i think that it takes up all the spare energy i have, i don&amp;#39;t feel like doing anything anymore, things that used to be fun are dull and i sometimes find myself just staring at the computer screen browsing the same pages i have done 10 times already. On top of that i keep blaming myself for all the things that have happened in my life, i blame myself for destroying the relationship with the love of my life. I dont think i can ever feel the same about anyone ever again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to get out of this circle of selt pity and blaming myself for everything, even things that if i think about it were not always in my control. Maybe i&amp;#39;m too harsh of a critic about myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actually i don&amp;#39;t feel like i know anything, not even myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This will probably be a long text partly because it's a long story and partly because i hope writing all this down and reflecting upon it will somehow bring perspective and help me.\n\n**Background**\n\nOur story starts 14 years ago, at the time i was 15 years old starting the Swedish equivalent of high school.

This continued until 2014 when my mother died of cancer, i had known she had cancer for about 2 - 3 years at that point and it came as a huge surprise, she went from good to really bad in one month, the cancer had spread to her brain. After her death i fell down deep into the black void again and i think this was the only time Shaniqua REALLY supported me. She was great, she was very patient and helped me a lot. Around the start of 2015 i think she started to feel depressed, i think there was a lot of pressure from her university studies and i tried to support her, she became very cold towards me and at times very angry. And then i made the second big mistake in that relationship, i talked to some of my colleagues about this, maybe i was whining a bit to them because i sometimes felt like i was the only one trying to make our relationship work (in hindsight this was extremely selfish and stupid). Anyway, as i said before, it is impossible to keep anything from this girl so naturally she found this out and that was the equivalent of me cheating on her. Which lead to her throwing me out of our apartment. I got lucky and was able to rent a room from a colleague at work until i could find my own place which i did in august of 2016, i have been living there since then. There are many things not said here and i guess things might seem very simplified from just a wall of text.\n\n**Present**\n\nI have been working at my current job since the start of 2016, it's a very high pressure job with a manager that sucks at his job. When things are good the reason is of course his good leadership, when things go bad he throws people under the bus. So for two years i have been under a lot of stress, it has started to affect my sleep, i don't feel rested when i wake up a few days of the week, especially  end of the week before the weekend. Right now im in the process of finding a new job but i think that it takes up all the spare energy i have, i don't feel like doing anything anymore, things that used to be fun are dull and i sometimes find myself just staring at the computer screen browsing the same pages i have done 10 times already. On top of that i keep blaming myself for all the things that have happened in my life, i blame myself for destroying the relationship with the love of my life. I dont think i can ever feel the same about anyone ever again. \n\nI don't know how to get out of this circle of selt pity and blaming myself for everything, even things that if i think about it were not always in my control. Maybe i'm too harsh of a critic about myself.\n\nActually i don't feel like i know anything, not even myself anymore.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i2nx0", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I feel stuck and cant get out.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i2nx0", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7i2nx0/i_feel_stuck_and_cant_get_out/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512636634.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i2nx0/i_feel_stuck_and_cant_get_out/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Smurfhits1990", "created_utc": 1512607834.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wanna type again, read the previous post I made.

So perfect... I felt so much love for this person and I fell for her like crazy.\n\nShe gave all the right \"signs\":\nHeld my hand when sitting next to each other, sent random selfies of herselves and photos of what she did today when I asked how does she feels, was so warm to me every hug with her killed me.\n\nShe then sent a text saying she doesn't know what she wants and explaining why the distance and work doesn't help her.\n\nShe told me how special, interesting and amazing I am and told me that she still wants me so much in her life.\n\nI read that, felt pressure in my chest and like my heart was shrinking.\n\nI explained to her that I thank her for the honesty, and how personally I think this is not what will stop the beaufitul think that could have be here, but I understand her.\n\nShe then wanted me to come and talk about it.\n\nTried, but as I arrived (not her home, her dorms. 50 meters from me) she got called to an emergancy and was sorry but went away.\n\nFew days later I asked her to just say if she want this date or not, and she said again how amazing I am bluh bluh bluh, and in any other situation she would definetly say yes, but in the current circumstances it's a no.\nShe proposed me to still be a part of her life, because she find me really special.\n\nI had to just explain her that I can't... I'm not mad or dissapointed at her, she is a person and have the right to feel what she wants, but I just have to keep my distance because I feel too much towords her to just stay friends... And that I'll be more distant, not from grudge, but for my mental stabilify.\n\nShe, of course like I knew, understood.\nShe said she knows and understand my feelings and what I choose is what'll be.\n\nAnd I assume this was our last convo.\n\nGuys... Sometimes I'll be in the same room with her and I feel pressure in my chest and blood like a maniac... I just can't hold it so much I really need to just hug her for an hour or something.\n\nI need your help to move on.\nI can't stop thinking about her. I feel so bad... So heavy... Like i'm gonna vomit every minute.\nIt's making my depression fucking worst and the pills doesn't work.\n\nI need to get her our of my head. I can't see her hugging another man without wanting to bang my head at the wall.\n\nI may be too emotional in these things... But I won't lie mates...

I&amp;#39;m 19 years old and I have struggled with mental health issues all my life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this post as short as I can, reader, but I&amp;#39;m new here and thought this is the right place to tell a large amount of people with what I deal with. I&amp;#39;ll continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start, I was a born stereotype. The nerdy African-American kid. No dad, single mom. Middle class. Bullied heavily. Liked sports at an earlier age. Trying to find his own way in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a weird childhood, I lived a few miles from the nearest town, in basically our own little farm with my mother, sister, and our grandparents. Keeping things brief, I was a sweet kid. Very humble and nice, still am. Smart, soft-spoken. Liked playing sports and video games. Fairly normal. Except for the bullying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was the only black kid in my entire class and faced lots of racial hazing and bullying when I was younger. Barely ever had girlfriends, racially targeted, the stuff you would think would happen in this situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forwarding, in the 9th Grade, I was lost. My &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; basically kept me on the outside of their clique, no direction, nobody to love, at-home issues but I found a friend in this prison. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His name was Jacob Bowersock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll always remember the first time I met him, we were taking the school bus home in middle school, and his older sister was being rude or something, so I straight called her a &amp;quot;bitch&amp;quot; out loud and little did I know, Jacob was sitting right next to me. Small world I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had an English class together and I remember we always used to sit in the back right chairs together in Mrs. Kirby&amp;#39;s classroom and just chat about the most random topics, like Morgan Freeman being our creator, music, life and everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was in similar situation to me and I really connected with him as he always me to embrace who I was at the time and be open, be free. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started dressing how &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; wanted to, listening to the music &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; wanted and now was the person &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He truly opened my eyes to the world in a way I won&amp;#39;t ever forget. He was a real true spirit, which was so brave to me as we lived in a very conservative community and high school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Jacob had problems too. Bad family life like mine, but he had a girlfriend who kept him happy and was a good friend of mine. I&amp;#39;ll never forget where I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was 11:30pm and I was lying in bed, in my room. I was tired, obviously about to go to sleep and my sister comes out of nowhere and in this very surprised voice, says, &amp;quot;They found Jacob with a shotgun wound in his head and are flying him to the ER now&amp;quot;, and simply apologized for giving the news and left. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was all a haze, I just stared this 10,000 mile stare into my ceiling. I was in shock. This wave of numbness hit me. I couldn&amp;#39;t even call it sadness, it was this just brooding, deep coldness to the world. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me and Jacob may have not been best friends, but he was so special for me and to me and who I was as a person. I wanted to be him, that&amp;#39;s how much I valued him. And he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the world ending could have made me care after that. I had to move to this absolutely horrible basement, not finshed..roaches, no door, it was horrible..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was dead inside and out. I stopped caring about the world and everything. I literally was a zombie. It felt like the world was in a eternal grey. Like a very nasty winter had came and stayed forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night, it hit rock bottom. I had harmed myself. It felt great but it was like taping up a crack on a dam. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dam poured out and there were months of torment, and depression and disassociation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then again there were more hell. I was jumped in the locker room by another classmate. Took a piece out of my ear and almost ripped it off. Called me a stupid n****r and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shocked, it all happened so fast. So strange. A few classmates helped me clean the blood, there was so much blood. You could smell it in the air. I was laughed at by most and of course, it was videotaped. Long story short, I needed stitches in my ear and he never ever to the school again. Damage was already done though. I still randomly flinch and flick and always shaky because of my anxiety issues most likely caused by this and other issues of bullying and abuse, on top of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life, it wasn&amp;#39;t even hell. It was something worse. It felt like solitary confinement. That&amp;#39;s the best way I can describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was more moving and more drama, a lover betrayed me and used me from the start. Probably my first adult relationship, I felt like I was all alone in the universe before and especially after her. Her name was Jackie. Strong, independent. But cold and ruthless. Dark black hair, pale skin, exactly what I like. I still get a tinge in my head when I hear that name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s get to my magnum opus of my mental health issues and everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After years of evolution and devolution, teachers guiding me and helping me through my torture, I was off to college. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only lasted about two weeks, total. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every moment, every second, was pure anxiety. I couldn&amp;#39;t think or breathe. I felt like I had a gun held to my head and every second, the trigger had a little more pressure applied. I wanted to kill myself (not the first time, sadly have gotten very close to trying..) so I dropped out in August of this year, and went home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost my way, I feel like a constant feeling.

I'm 19 years old and I have struggled with mental health issues all my life.*\n\nI'll try to keep this post as short as I can, reader, but I'm new here and thought this is the right place to tell a large amount of people with what I deal with. I'll continue.\n\nTo start, I was a born stereotype. The nerdy African-American kid. No dad, single mom. Middle class. Bullied heavily. Liked sports at an earlier age. Trying to find his own way in the world.\n\nI had a weird childhood, I lived a few miles from the nearest town, in basically our own little farm with my mother, sister, and our grandparents. Keeping things brief, I was a sweet kid. Very humble and nice, still am. Smart, soft-spoken. Liked playing sports and video games. Fairly normal. Except for the bullying. \n\nI was the only black kid in my entire class and faced lots of racial hazing and bullying when I was younger. Barely ever had girlfriends, racially targeted, the stuff you would think would happen in this situation. \n\nFlash forwarding, in the 9th Grade, I was lost. My \"friends\" basically kept me on the outside of their clique, no direction, nobody to love, at-home issues but I found a friend in this prison. \n\nHis name was Jacob Bowersock. \n\nI'll always remember the first time I met him, we were taking the school bus home in middle school, and his older sister was being rude or something, so I straight called her a \"bitch\" out loud and little did I know, Jacob was sitting right next to me. Small world I guess.\n\nWe had an English class together and I remember we always used to sit in the back right chairs together in Mrs. Kirby's classroom and just chat about the most random topics, like Morgan Freeman being our creator, music, life and everything.\n\nHe was in similar situation to me and I really connected with him as he always me to embrace who I was at the time and be open, be free. \n\nI started dressing how **i** wanted to, listening to the music **I** wanted and now was the person **I** wanted to be.\n\nHe truly opened my eyes to the world in a way I won't ever forget. He was a real true spirit, which was so brave to me as we lived in a very conservative community and high school. \n\nSadly, Jacob had problems too. Bad family life like mine, but he had a girlfriend who kept him happy and was a good friend of mine. I'll never forget where I was.\n\nIt was 11:30pm and I was lying in bed, in my room. I was tired, obviously about to go to sleep and my sister comes out of nowhere and in this very surprised voice, says, \"They found Jacob with a shotgun wound in his head and are flying him to the ER now\", and simply apologized for giving the news and left. \n\nIt was all a haze, I just stared this 10,000 mile stare into my ceiling. I was in shock. This wave of numbness hit me. I couldn't even call it sadness, it was this just brooding, deep coldness to the world. \n\nMe and Jacob may have not been best friends, but he was so special for me and to me and who I was as a person. I wanted to be him, that's how much I valued him. And he was gone.\n\nI don't think the world ending could have made me care after that. I had to move to this absolutely horrible basement, not finshed..roaches, no door, it was horrible..\n\nI was dead inside and out. I stopped caring about the world and everything. I literally was a zombie. It felt like the world was in a eternal grey. Like a very nasty winter had came and stayed forever. \n\nOne night, it hit rock bottom. I had harmed myself. It felt great but it was like taping up a crack on a dam. \n\nThe dam poured out and there were months of torment, and depression and disassociation.\n\nThen again there were more hell. I was jumped in the locker room by another classmate. Took a piece out of my ear and almost ripped it off. Called me a stupid n****r and left.\n\nI was shocked, it all happened so fast. So strange. A few classmates helped me clean the blood, there was so much blood. You could smell it in the air. I was laughed at by most and of course, it was videotaped. Long story short, I needed stitches in my ear and he never ever to the school again. Damage was already done though. I still randomly flinch and flick and always shaky because of my anxiety issues most likely caused by this and other issues of bullying and abuse, on top of everything else.\n\nLife, it wasn't even hell. It was something worse. It felt like solitary confinement. That's the best way I can describe it.\n\nThere was more moving and more drama, a lover betrayed me and used me from the start. Probably my first adult relationship, I felt like I was all alone in the universe before and especially after her. Her name was Jackie. Strong, independent. But cold and ruthless. Dark black hair, pale skin, exactly what I like. I still get a tinge in my head when I hear that name.\n\nNow let's get to my magnum opus of my mental health issues and everything.\n\nAfter years of evolution and devolution, teachers guiding me and helping me through my torture, I was off to college. \n\nI only lasted about two weeks, total. \n\nEvery moment, every second, was pure anxiety. I couldn't think or breathe. I felt like I had a gun held to my head and every second, the trigger had a little more pressure applied. I wanted to kill myself (not the first time, sadly have gotten very close to trying..) so I dropped out in August of this year, and went home.\n\nI've lost my way, I feel like a constant feeling. Everyone tells me I'm an idiot for leaving, that I need to go back in or get some higher education. College just isn't for me and it feels like no one, I mean no one besides a very small few understands. My girlfriend, (my little kiisu) from Estonia. She's been dealing with me and my issues for almost a year now, Christmas Day to be exact. We both have mental health issues and on a FB group for people w/mental health disorders, we found one another. It's up and downs but I wanna spend the rest of my life with her and she is the only thing that I wake up for most of the time.\n\nI'm Blake, I'm a 19 year old male from Illinois, I'm Bisexual and I've dealing with mental health issues from almost a decade now\n\nThank you for listening to my story, for those who stayed through my nonsensical ramblings. I appreciate it a lot. \n\nIf you care about things outside of my mental health, I'm on Twitter and YT @2SplitWings. \n\nI love you all, and makes me feel better today knowing I'm not alone, and that finally, I'm speaking out. Have a nice day y'all.

A more important thing she wants me not doing is interacting with people online (e.g. Reddit), and she&amp;#39;s going way too overboard with it, like threatening me that she&amp;#39;ll call Google up and obtaining my entire history (deleted or not), and she&amp;#39;ll get me thrown in prison for being &amp;quot;disrespectful&amp;quot;.

Because whenever I kept up my friendship with a child at school my mother disliked, she would beat me to death later that day, and demanded me not to tell my class or teacher about it. The specific things she did to abuse me is another story. She would also beat me badly if I did normal things wrong, like not understanding homework questions, but that&amp;#39;s no way to raise your child in a good way.

Well, this is a punishment itself, and I can&amp;#39;t bare it anymore. I don&amp;#39;t wanna wait another 3-5 years to get out of here. It&amp;#39;s sickening. Since my mother despises the music I listen to, I want headphones really bad. But she even suspects I want them because I want to watch some more p**n.

I do not recommend anyone try this before consulting this a physician or psychologist ]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello,\nI am an independent researcher and psychonaut looking into new treatments for depression. \nI&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this for a while, and I think that one of the best preventive methods to help suicidal people would be the upregulation of kappa opioid receptors in the brain by stimulation of said receptors. This can be done with any k-opioid receptor agonist but in this instance I think Salvinorin A is the best pick.\nSalvinorin A is a trans-neoclerodane diterpene that binds strongly to the k-opioid receptor. It&amp;#39;s effects are a generally describes as dysphoric and dissociative but it&amp;#39;s mechanism of action vastly differs from more common dissociatives.\nKetamine for example works by blocking the NMDA receptor which plays an important role in the activation of neurons and long term potentiation. While stimulating this receptor with any agonist the rate at which neurons fire increases. Ketamine is an antagonist so it slows the firing speed of neurons. The NMDA receptor is part of the glutamate system which is generally associated with the GABA system. The GABA receptor is what alcohol binds to and is generally regarded as the opposite of the NMDA receptor. Alcohol or rather ethanol is an agonist to the GABA receptor also making it slow down the firing rate of neurons.\nAs you can see, most dissasociatives act on the same sub systems like the two amino acid based neurotransmitters I mentioned above. Salvinorin A on the other hand, is rather special. It binds to the k-opioid receptor. \nNow to understand why this is important in the treatment of depression you need to understand how this affects the brain and more importantly what consciousness is.\nCrick and Koch were two neuroscientists who occupied themselves with solving this mystery.\nThey speculated that an area of the brain called the Claustrum, plays an essential role in subjective experience and they proposed its role as some sort of conductor of consciousness.\nCrick and Koch described a concept where a limited number of neurons would be in charge of consciousness. They described the attributes these neurons should have as follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) Be central in the connection scheme of the human brain, not too close to primary sensory or motor areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Involve a number of sensory areas, since consciousness integrates several sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Have activity correlated with conscious experience, even in situations where it is dissociated from direct sensory input (for instance during the perception of visual illusions)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last paper Crick authored before his death, he and Koch argued that the claustrum is an ideal candidate for this role (Crick and Koch, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a later study about Salvinorin A, new light was shed on Circk and Koch observation about the claustrum. Salvia Divinorum is a perennial plant from the Lamiaceae family. This means it falls under the same family as common mint (Mentha) and common sage (Salvia Originalis). It grows naturally in the Sierra Mazateca and is used by Mazatec shamans for vision questing and spiritual experiences. This is due to the selective agonism on the kappa-opioid system that this molecule possesses.\nStrong activity was found in the limbic and association cortex, ventral striatum, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, claustrum, amygdala, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra (Sim-Selley et al., 1999). The authors report that \u201cA very high level of \u03ba-opioid receptor binding was observed in the claustrum.\u201d\n\u03ba-opioid receptors seem to inhibit neuronal impulses to a degree and are associated with nociception, consciousness, motor control, and mood. Because Salvinorin A triggered a large amount of these receptors in the claustrum, it is often reported by recreational users of the compound that (when vaporized) all sense of self and of reality disappears and that you are left with a brain processing information without a conscious aspect to interpret it. This is usually described as ego-dead.\nA way you could explain this is that all parts of the brain are basically senses of their own. A memory stored in the hippocampus has to be accessed through a neuronal pathway making the hippocampus a sort of \u2018memory sense\u2019. The visual cortex processes the information coming into your eyes into a 3 dimensional picture with defined objects that you can recognize and understand. If you see the claustrum as the main coordinator of these processes you could say that you are essentially your claustrum experiencing input from other brain areas. When your claustrum or \u2018you\u2019 is shut down (by activation of the KOR), you as a conscious entity, essentially dies. There is no observer to interpret and place sensory experience into the picture of consciousness.\nYou could imagine your brain as being a big corporate office trying to sustain you. This office has a lot of departments representing the different brain areas. All these departments are doing their own separate research and processes but only one of them is the management. This would be the department that ultimately make the decisions and observations. If you imagine the claustrum as the management department and this is shut down, you can imagine how all the other departments just lose track. The information they process essentially becomes useless electrochemical energy not being used or processed.\nSalvia is one of the few atypical psychedelics that don&amp;#39;t act on the serotonin system. \nThe upregulation of the k-opioid receptor is a direct result of salvia. Just like how you get withdrawal symptoms from opioids or depression after MDMA. Here these compounds trigger the respective receptors to such a degree that your body is going to make more of them. When there are more receptors, you get desensitized to the effects of the neurotransmitter. This is then slowly reversed to reach homeostasis. \nIn drugs that have a euphoric effect this can impact your mindset in a negative way, you feel less happy or you feel like the world is bland and stupid. With salvia on the other hand, the upregulation of the k-opioid receptors which produces a dysphoric effect. The effects can positively influence someone to make them feel more contempt with life.\nAlso the immediate trauma induced by the experience offers a way for the brain to stop worrying about the struggles of everyday life as the experience itself is overwhelming. Slow administration of salvinorin a would probably have positive effects on depression too without having to experience any hallucinatory property\u2019s of the substance. \nNow I myself have tried salvia and all I can say is that it was very scary and traumatizing yet refreshing an beautiful in a way. I felt better than ever when I started to feel normal again, those 3 minutes of intense tripping felt like a year of therapy sessions and it lasted for months.

Well she actually isn&amp;#39;t THAT unattainable. And I am making moves. It&amp;#39;s just that I&amp;#39;m not really doing it in the hopes that she&amp;#39;ll love me someday. My main goal is for her to &amp;quot;enjoy me being in her company&amp;quot;. Perhaps even climb all the way up into the friendzone.

I was born with a version of cerebral palsy. In my case it has only affected my legs rather than my whole body like in more well known situations. I can walk but I have experienced many surgeries during my life just to be able to do that. Even now, at my highest level of physical capabilities so far, I am far below the standard of a normal person. My balance is bad, my max running speed is pretty shit, my usual walking speed is slower than normal (As in I have to half-run to keep up with others), my legs start hurting very quickly and I can&amp;#39;t stand straight - when I stand, my legs are visibly bent at the knees and that makes me look weird and shorter than I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this has resulted in me becoming shy and fat (because I move a lot less). In 7th grade I had a very desperate crush on a classmate. Due to being shy and also realistic about how little I had to offer (As in there was no reason for anyone to like me romantically) I did not act on it in any way.\nI suffered for the entire school year in silence and lost 15 kilos. I was still moving just as little as before but I straight up didn&amp;#39;t want to eat. Lost my appetite so badly that my weight dropped without me doing anything proactive about it. At the time I was a very very honestly kind person and a hard worker, participating in contests and bringing fame to my school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I lost that much weight I stopped being fat and by 8th grade I felt like I can actually try to do something about my crush. I didn&amp;#39;t look that bad anymore and I felt that was my main problem so I became more confident. However, 8th grade turned out to be a catastrophe where due to my eagerness and naivety I fucked everything up for myself. By the end of 8th grade I knew my crush did not like me back at all and I was being verbally bullied by my classmates (because ironically, a disabled person is safer from physical bullying than a healthy person due to people fearing retribution for harming someone so helpless).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a sidenote, Summer is my least favorite time of year. When I don&amp;#39;t have to go to school I become a complete shut-in just staying at my computer. Noone actually ever contacts me during Summer so it&amp;#39;s just three months of solitary mind-fuck for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For 9th grade I transferred to a different school. Not because of the whole bullying thing but because I was a prodigy and got a spot in a prestigious school rather than stay with the rest. I instantly went hunting for someone to have a crush on. I am just very romantically obsessive. Two weeks into the school year after a ton of thought I had chosen a classmate to obsess over while calling it a crush. 9th grade was essentially a year I spent befriending her and actually succeeded at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the second day of the 10th grade (And the first day with actual lessons) I was overwhelmed with an absurd amount of feelings. I felt like I would burst. So after the lessons I confessed to that girl. She said a phrase that in this context usually means &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; but can be pretty vague. It&amp;#39;s in Lithuanian so I can&amp;#39;t tell you exactly what it was. I hugged her, believing she accepted the confession, and went home. Late that evening she wrote me on Facebook and told me I misunderstood that vague phrase and that she also had a boyfriend. It&amp;#39;s a worthwhile debate to this day for me if she really did have a boyfriend. I am not convinced personally but whatever. Next days I went to school like usual. I was extremely angered but I kept up my friendship with her and only 4 days later I stopped furiously pacing back and forth in class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An important thing about my life that must be considered is the influence the anime &amp;quot;Death Note&amp;quot; had on me. In 8th grade, when I stopped being fat, I was also a great fan of this show. I really liked Light Yagami, the protagonist and villain of the show. I decided that I would try to become like him, everything included. Confidence, manipulation, a facade. I learned not to show emotion when I did not want to, I learned how to best fake being nice, I learned to fake confidence. What had once been honest niceness became a false niceness of a bitter, broken individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I am in 12th grade. You might wonder why I skipped the rest of 10th grade or why 11th grade doesn&amp;#39;t even get a paragraph. It&amp;#39;s because those don&amp;#39;t matter at all. I&amp;#39;ve been pretty much dead to the world since that confession and continuing my routine has been my only task. I have a lot of acquaintances at school but noone that I would call a friend. That girl I confessed to is still the best &amp;#39;friend&amp;#39; I have but it&amp;#39;s not mutual. I know that I am not nearly as important to her as some of her other friends. I&amp;#39;ve just been staying around her because it&amp;#39;s the easy thing to do and because I am still obsessed with her. All of the teachers love me. I am the star of literature class because I like to think about everything all of the time and I am not afraid to tell my thoughts to the class. My computer science teacher likes me for my passion for programming and the work ethic I have for it. I talk about life and the world with my biology teacher because we&amp;#39;re kind of friends at this point. My history teacher likes me because I am obedient and a fan of history. My economics teacher likes me for producing great work on time always. But all of that is meaningless. I don&amp;#39;t give a fuck about that anymore. I am just bitter, lonely, with zero friends that I can actually be honest with, thinking about suicide all of the time. I am extremely horny, which I control by masturbating a lot. Have never had a girlfriend, have never kissed a girl. Have lost a testicle through a random fuck up of my body that wasn&amp;#39;t even my fault or an injury. And I still have that disability I mentioned at the start. Only my total not giving a fuck and general passive attitude has prevented me from committing suicide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose all there is left to say is - any advice is welcome because I am in a terrible emotional and mental state and have been for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I am currently in 12th grade, 18 years old.

If i try to contribute to a conversation its usually awkward if i say more than two words. If i suggest a topic ive noticed that im usually dismissed or ignored. \n      \n       I have anxiety about my intelligence and memory because ive lost expensive things like phones etc low self esteem and hatred for my clumsiness, and body aswell. I get sweaty around large groups . I probably dont give a positive aura to people and thats why im avoided? Should i use percocet ? Does anyone else have similar experiences ? Tips ?\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i0592", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "R/depressed largely based on loneliness but cant bond with most people", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i0592", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7i0592/rdepressed_largely_based_on_loneliness_but_cant/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512614603.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i0592/rdepressed_largely_based_on_loneliness_but_cant/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ticklewulf", "created_utc": 1512585803.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a friend tell me he used to suffer from depression but ever since he got a GF and was introduced to her world, he just didn&amp;#39;t have as much of it anymore.

Things started to break down between us and we looked for help, had a great counselor lined up and everything. Then I decided to fuck it all up again and not put in the work for us.

Helping everyone I know with a fake smile on my face. Kinda scary how well some of us can fake emotions when we have to do it daily. So now I dread going to sleep as I have dreams about some version of a &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; life I missed out on and when I&amp;#39;m awake I get pulled into these fits of depression that take longer and longer to get out of, just feel so fucking worthless  sometimes.

I don\u2019t really know what I am looking for, but I guess mostly I just want to blurt out all my feelings to a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to just explain everything so sorry for the wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I have a memory of being in primary school and thinking that everyone I loved would be better off if I died, that my parents would be happier to have more money and that none of my friends like me anyway. And basically, that has been the theme for the past decade and a half-ish since. It isn\u2019t constant, for most of the time I\u2019m happy and energetic and enthusiastic about the things I love. I do have low self-esteem, I believe I am generally terrible, I think all my achievements are down to luck rather than ability and I tend to always doubt that people actually like me, but for the most part I don\u2019t let it get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s just every now and then \u2013 usually around once or twice a month \u2013 I just feel awful. Sometimes it\u2019s because of something specific \u2013 like I\u2019m finding my university work difficult or I\u2019ve sat and stared at the ceiling for an hour because I can\u2019t get myself to start an essay or basically every time I go clothes shopping and feel bad about my appearance\u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s for no reason, I just wake up and think of all the reasons I have to hate myself.

I don\u2019t really know what I am looking for, but I guess mostly I just want to blurt out all my feelings to a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to just explain everything so sorry for the wall of text.\n\n\nI have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I have a memory of being in primary school and thinking that everyone I loved would be better off if I died, that my parents would be happier to have more money and that none of my friends like me anyway. And basically, that has been the theme for the past decade and a half-ish since. It isn\u2019t constant, for most of the time I\u2019m happy and energetic and enthusiastic about the things I love. I do have low self-esteem, I believe I am generally terrible, I think all my achievements are down to luck rather than ability and I tend to always doubt that people actually like me, but for the most part I don\u2019t let it get in the way.\n\n\nIt\u2019s just every now and then \u2013 usually around once or twice a month \u2013 I just feel awful. Sometimes it\u2019s because of something specific \u2013 like I\u2019m finding my university work difficult or I\u2019ve sat and stared at the ceiling for an hour because I can\u2019t get myself to start an essay or basically every time I go clothes shopping and feel bad about my appearance\u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s for no reason, I just wake up and think of all the reasons I have to hate myself. I feel weary, hopeless, tearful, guilt-ridden, I have no motivation to do anything, I don\u2019t care about my own health, I feel bad about being overweight so I try and stop eating, but then I just end up eating too much, I find ways to hurt myself like punching myself, scratching my skin or holding my hand under the hot tap, I think about suicide a lot and at the lowest points all I can think about it suicide.

My mom has turned off our router at like 11pm but I still stay awake cause I just can&amp;#39;t sleep.

There&amp;#39;s a lot of things in my life that may be contributing to my mood but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to make sense of it. I&amp;#39;m hoping just typing all this out helps.I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this cohesive, but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never suffered from any type of depression before but I am starting to wonder if I am. I&amp;#39;m in my late 20&amp;#39;s and my mom has suffered in the past. I&amp;#39;m happily married with two wonderful kids and a good job for background. Lately, I&amp;#39;ve been struggling a lot at work. I&amp;#39;m a fairly high achiever and success is something very important to me. I have a degree in engineering and a masters degree. I&amp;#39;ve done really well at work but lately I&amp;#39;m struggling to keep up. On this end, I feel very discontent at work. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m maybe just bored as things have been somewhat slow. I&amp;#39;ve also been working into project management as well and wonder if I&amp;#39;m just getting anxiety from that. I don&amp;#39;t feel like I have the right tools yet to give myself a &amp;quot;framework&amp;quot; to work in, which I know is important to me (in college I did much better in classes with an organized professor). I am optimistic I can create my framework with experience but I just don&amp;#39;t have it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been looking hard to switch jobs. I used to love my job but that has dwindled. I don&amp;#39;t know if looking for other jobs has opened a box now that I can&amp;#39;t close, or why I want out so bad. I don&amp;#39;t know if this is due to changing responsibilities and resulting anxiety or a different/deeper issue and this is where it is manifesting itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety has been getting to me as well. My oldest kid is not biologically mine and I&amp;#39;ve always had some anxiety when dealing with the whole situation. I used to be able to manage it fine but lately its gotten much worse. Recently when we were taking him to his dad&amp;#39;s for a trip I was having really bad anxiety. My wife pointed out that night how withdrawn I was and I was driving really bad (we were running late as well). When I looked back at the situation and thought about it, I felt like I was a different person that was not in control of myself. This terrified me. I had a breakdown talking about this because it got so overwhelming. When I was trying to talk to my wife about it felt like my mouth was stuck shut. I couldn&amp;#39;t form thoughts to say and I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever felt so trapped. I still haven&amp;#39;t really had a substantive conversation with anyone about this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally to add to it, I&amp;#39;ve noticed in past years that I get sluggish this time of year. I&amp;#39;ve looked up SAD and figure I suffer mildly from it. Years past its always been mild though. I&amp;#39;m slightly less energetic but still get though my days. This year, either from SAD or a combo of other things, I am starting to dread each day. It feels like a struggle to get though a day at work. I&amp;#39;m mostly OK at home and I am still good about keeping up house work and cooking (one of my favorite hobbies).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also live in my head a lot. I always have. Coming here I saw a topic on the main page about this, which I always thought everyone was that way but maybe not. I don&amp;#39;t think this is a problem necessarily, but I&amp;#39;ve noticed I&amp;#39;m withdrawing socially, mainly at work. I used to go out to lunch a lot or eat in the break room with co-workers but I&amp;#39;ve been favoring just eating my office or going somewhere alone lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to start. I get overwhelmed trying to think if I need help and if so where do I go. My wife suffers from some anxiety and I&amp;#39;ve taking on being the rock in our relationship. I feel a ton of pressure to maintain this now as it is more of a facade than a truth. Where is the best place to start?

Now that my mood has returned I feel embarrassed saying I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;quietly crying for help&amp;quot; like I&amp;#39;m being hyperbolic. I&amp;#39;ve did a personality test a while back at a seminar that in my included profile is disdain for displays of emotion which is 100% me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My thoughts feel like they are extremely scattered. There's a lot of things in my life that may be contributing to my mood but I'm not sure how to make sense of it. I'm hoping just typing all this out helps.I'll try to keep this cohesive, but here goes:\n\nI've never suffered from any type of depression before but I am starting to wonder if I am. I'm in my late 20's and my mom has suffered in the past. I'm happily married with two wonderful kids and a good job for background. Lately, I've been struggling a lot at work. I'm a fairly high achiever and success is something very important to me. I have a degree in engineering and a masters degree. I've done really well at work but lately I'm struggling to keep up. On this end, I feel very discontent at work. I don't know if I'm maybe just bored as things have been somewhat slow. I've also been working into project management as well and wonder if I'm just getting anxiety from that. I don't feel like I have the right tools yet to give myself a \"framework\" to work in, which I know is important to me (in college I did much better in classes with an organized professor). I am optimistic I can create my framework with experience but I just don't have it yet.\n\nI've also been looking hard to switch jobs. I used to love my job but that has dwindled. I don't know if looking for other jobs has opened a box now that I can't close, or why I want out so bad. I don't know if this is due to changing responsibilities and resulting anxiety or a different/deeper issue and this is where it is manifesting itself.\n\nAnxiety has been getting to me as well. My oldest kid is not biologically mine and I've always had some anxiety when dealing with the whole situation. I used to be able to manage it fine but lately its gotten much worse. Recently when we were taking him to his dad's for a trip I was having really bad anxiety. My wife pointed out that night how withdrawn I was and I was driving really bad (we were running late as well). When I looked back at the situation and thought about it, I felt like I was a different person that was not in control of myself. This terrified me. I had a breakdown talking about this because it got so overwhelming. When I was trying to talk to my wife about it felt like my mouth was stuck shut. I couldn't form thoughts to say and I don't think I've ever felt so trapped. I still haven't really had a substantive conversation with anyone about this. \n\nFinally to add to it, I've noticed in past years that I get sluggish this time of year. I've looked up SAD and figure I suffer mildly from it. Years past its always been mild though. I'm slightly less energetic but still get though my days. This year, either from SAD or a combo of other things, I am starting to dread each day. It feels like a struggle to get though a day at work. I'm mostly OK at home and I am still good about keeping up house work and cooking (one of my favorite hobbies).\n\nI also live in my head a lot. I always have. Coming here I saw a topic on the main page about this, which I always thought everyone was that way but maybe not. I don't think this is a problem necessarily, but I've noticed I'm withdrawing socially, mainly at work. I used to go out to lunch a lot or eat in the break room with co-workers but I've been favoring just eating my office or going somewhere alone lately.\n\nI don't know where to start. I get overwhelmed trying to think if I need help and if so where do I go. My wife suffers from some anxiety and I've taking on being the rock in our relationship. I feel a ton of pressure to maintain this now as it is more of a facade than a truth. Where is the best place to start? I don't have any regular doctors, general or otherwise and I don't know what to do. I'm quietly crying for help because I feel like I can't shout for it, but I realize more and more that I need it. Any help to understand what is going on is greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: I get embarrassed too about this. I was pretty emotional as I finished this post.

She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was &amp;#39;fucking crazy&amp;#39; and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again.

Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways.

I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes.\n\n\n\nWith that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.\n\n\n\nIt's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.\n\n\n\n I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me.\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hwydb", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My First Real Episode", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7hwydb", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7hwydb/my_first_real_episode/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512581096.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7hwydb/my_first_real_episode/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ThatOneDork", "created_utc": 1512552296.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost 20kg in fat and put on about 10kg in muscle!

I\u2019ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I\u2019m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I\u2019m asking for help, guidance, I don\u2019t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn\u2019t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn\u2019t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I\u2019m here today. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My, now fianc\u00e9, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I\u2019m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t he move here?,\u201d or \u201cwhy don\u2019t you move there?\u201d \nHere\u2019s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I\u2019m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fianc\u00e9 visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil\u2019s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I have talked a lot about my fianc\u00e9 but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said \u201cI have no idea!

I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don\u2019t know how upset I am about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved to Portland... and now I believe I\u2019m regretting it... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn\u2019t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well... it\u2019s not nice. Not nice at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there\u2019s and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the first thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke... I met with the boss who said the store isn\u2019t open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who didn\u2019t know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef\u2019s actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and didn\u2019t even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I wasn\u2019t able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the second.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my fianc\u00e9 came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult... it\u2019s a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but... every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fianc\u00e9 and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just don\u2019t know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fianc\u00e9 and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the third..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fianc\u00e9 was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance... more money on shit I can\u2019t afford. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this... it\u2019s my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that\u2019s been going on, it\u2019s gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I\u2019m not fat, I\u2019d say I\u2019m average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fianc\u00e9 wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening... why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fianc\u00e9, I can\u2019t get stable, I now starting out as an adult isn\u2019t supposed to be easy but guys... this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I don\u2019t have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I\u2019m climbing up an escalator that\u2019s going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I\u2019ve annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fianc\u00e9 sometimes even. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well if you\u2019ve made it this far I thank you sincerely... I just really needed to vent. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I\u2019ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I\u2019m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I\u2019m asking for help, guidance, I don\u2019t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... \n\nI\u2019m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn\u2019t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. \n\nAfter I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn\u2019t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled.\n\nMy next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I\u2019m here today. \n\nMy, now fianc\u00e9, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I\u2019m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t he move here?,\u201d or \u201cwhy don\u2019t you move there?\u201d \nHere\u2019s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I\u2019m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fianc\u00e9 visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil\u2019s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. \n\nI know I have talked a lot about my fianc\u00e9 but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said \u201cI have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!\u201d Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don\u2019t know how upset I am about it. \n\nI moved to Portland... and now I believe I\u2019m regretting it... \n\nI moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn\u2019t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice! \n\nWell... it\u2019s not nice.

I am a 22-year-old in my fourth year of school at a semi large public university.  I&amp;#39;ve struggled with depression for a long time. going on about three years now. I haven\u2019t received much help from doctors or therapists thus far besides going to my family doctor for anti-depressants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over Thanksgiving break I saw a hypnotherapist and while I do think the session was good for me, I\u2019m not exactly sure if it will help me a ton. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The depression has gotten considerably worse this semester so I\u2019ll give you the run-down of what has transpired. This semester was going to be my first in which I take classes that are directly related to my major. I was so so excited to finally get started in them. There were two classes that directly related. Programming and Business data systems. They both have turned out to be pretty awful. In programming the subject matter wasn\u2019t too bad for me but my teacher was not helpful in understanding the material and would frequently send out passive aggressive responses and announcements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The business data systems class was just all-around garbage. I could not focus on the information, I was extremely disinterested in it, and the teacher was, quite frankly, an ass. He would frequently mock students who would raise their hand and answer questions in class, as well as upload assignments the night before they were due. \nTo make matters worse the second teacher is my major\u2019s administrative head. Meaning that he basically was in charge of designing the classes and track of the classes. Due to this and me having trouble succeeding in these classes I changed my major to marketing which I am actually excited for as the classes seem interesting, I know multiple people in the program, and my schedule next semester is not very intense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish that I was writing to you telling how I fought the good fight and gave the semester the good ole \u201ccollege try\u201d but sadly I\u2019m not. From about August to early November I had been on a medium dose(150mg) of Zoloft daily. Initially it was working great. But as pressure began to mount and I began to fall behind it wasn\u2019t cutting it. I found myself struggling to motivate myself to get out of bed and leave the house daily. Feelings of self-deprecation and worthlessness began to rise and I quickly lost hope of salvaging my grades as they had already fallen far.  I felt like I was at the bottom of an extremely deep well looking out on the normal world with its normal functioning people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things did begin to pick up however once I was prescribed Effexor after telling my doctor about my lack of motivation and the like. I\u2019m currently on 75mg a day and I feel mentally stable, but it feels like I am not as personable as I once was. If that is true or not I\u2019m not very sure. Recently I got a girlfriend and while our relationship is good, I\u2019ve been having trouble getting and maintaining erections when we have sex. This is very embarrassing for me. I\u2019ve never had this problem and I know it is not common for people my age to experience this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going into the holiday season I\u2019m not really sure about what to tell my family how my semester has gone. I know I\u2019ll spin the same old story to my more distant relatives but as for my parents I don\u2019t know. This will be my worst academic semester of my life and I can\u2019t help but feel guilty. I know that once the next semester starts I will probably be placed on academic suspension by the university. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll have an incredibly hard time getting off of it as the classes I\u2019m taking next semester aren\u2019t the most difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately I\u2019ve been feeling like I am just stupid or just some loser and that\u2019s why I am doing so poorly. I\u2019m not really sure what to do. How can I tell my parents that the treatment methods I\u2019m utilizing now aren\u2019t helping all that much? How do I tell them about my putrid grades? Has anyone else on Effexor experienced loss of personality or ED? \nI\u2019m feeling very lost in life and I\u2019m not really sure where or who to turn to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to whoever has read this far.

I haven\u2019t received much help from doctors or therapists thus far besides going to my family doctor for anti-depressants.\n\nOver Thanksgiving break I saw a hypnotherapist and while I do think the session was good for me, I\u2019m not exactly sure if it will help me a ton. \n\nThe depression has gotten considerably worse this semester so I\u2019ll give you the run-down of what has transpired. This semester was going to be my first in which I take classes that are directly related to my major. I was so so excited to finally get started in them. There were two classes that directly related. Programming and Business data systems. They both have turned out to be pretty awful. In programming the subject matter wasn\u2019t too bad for me but my teacher was not helpful in understanding the material and would frequently send out passive aggressive responses and announcements.\n\nThe business data systems class was just all-around garbage. I could not focus on the information, I was extremely disinterested in it, and the teacher was, quite frankly, an ass. He would frequently mock students who would raise their hand and answer questions in class, as well as upload assignments the night before they were due. \nTo make matters worse the second teacher is my major\u2019s administrative head. Meaning that he basically was in charge of designing the classes and track of the classes. Due to this and me having trouble succeeding in these classes I changed my major to marketing which I am actually excited for as the classes seem interesting, I know multiple people in the program, and my schedule next semester is not very intense. \n\nI wish that I was writing to you telling how I fought the good fight and gave the semester the good ole \u201ccollege try\u201d but sadly I\u2019m not. From about August to early November I had been on a medium dose(150mg) of Zoloft daily. Initially it was working great. But as pressure began to mount and I began to fall behind it wasn\u2019t cutting it. I found myself struggling to motivate myself to get out of bed and leave the house daily. Feelings of self-deprecation and worthlessness began to rise and I quickly lost hope of salvaging my grades as they had already fallen far.  I felt like I was at the bottom of an extremely deep well looking out on the normal world with its normal functioning people. \n\nThings did begin to pick up however once I was prescribed Effexor after telling my doctor about my lack of motivation and the like. I\u2019m currently on 75mg a day and I feel mentally stable, but it feels like I am not as personable as I once was. If that is true or not I\u2019m not very sure. Recently I got a girlfriend and while our relationship is good, I\u2019ve been having trouble getting and maintaining erections when we have sex. This is very embarrassing for me. I\u2019ve never had this problem and I know it is not common for people my age to experience this.  \n\nGoing into the holiday season I\u2019m not really sure about what to tell my family how my semester has gone. I know I\u2019ll spin the same old story to my more distant relatives but as for my parents I don\u2019t know. This will be my worst academic semester of my life and I can\u2019t help but feel guilty. I know that once the next semester starts I will probably be placed on academic suspension by the university. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll have an incredibly hard time getting off of it as the classes I\u2019m taking next semester aren\u2019t the most difficult.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling like I am just stupid or just some loser and that\u2019s why I am doing so poorly. I\u2019m not really sure what to do. How can I tell my parents that the treatment methods I\u2019m utilizing now aren\u2019t helping all that much? How do I tell them about my putrid grades? Has anyone else on Effexor experienced loss of personality or ED? \nI\u2019m feeling very lost in life and I\u2019m not really sure where or who to turn to. \n\nThank you to whoever has read this far. Please fell free to comment you would like. Thank you.

I would have done anything, if you would have just told me i was being suffocating. I missed his birthday, i missed thanksgiving, i will miss christmas with the boy i agreed to raise as if he were my own. I will miss our wedding, and late nights with the cat gizmo sleeping on my head. I will miss your voice, and your laugh. Your scathing wit, and seeing you walk through the door.  I miss having you close to me. I love you. I dont know how i will move on from this. But i will keep trying.\n\nI hope you read this, after i created a reddit account for you, even after i forgot i'd done so.\n\nIt won't acomplish fuck all, but hopefully you know i still give a damn.

Its a long post but i just have to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). \nI have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. \nBasically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :))\nI consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the &amp;quot;odd one out&amp;quot;, but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGH SCHOOL&lt;/strong&gt; (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 &amp;quot;classes&amp;quot;. \nThis is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was &amp;quot;depressed&amp;quot; during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone.\nBut that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided \n in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. \nAfter 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. \nThe only way i felt better was with playing runescape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined\nYear 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy.\nAnd on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLLEGE&lt;/strong&gt;\nThis was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study &amp;quot;orthopedagogie&amp;quot;, it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that.\nOfcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE.\nIn my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a &amp;quot;friend group&amp;quot;. I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later.\nDuring the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february.\nI still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with &amp;quot;depression&amp;quot; (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. \nTo be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because &amp;quot;i work to slow&amp;quot;. Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a &amp;quot;mental&amp;quot; side to it. I can come across different then the &amp;quot;normal person&amp;quot;, or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. \nMy parents just said im a slow learner but with &amp;quot;hard work i get there&amp;quot;. This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of &amp;quot;ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you&amp;quot;. Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself.\nI feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating...\n&amp;quot;Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Grow up for once&amp;quot;. But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost... \nI will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: i have no clue how to get the text all the same size&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this.\n\nLet me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). \nI have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. \nBasically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :))\nI consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.\n\nI've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the \"odd one out\", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. \nEventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 \"classes\". \nThis is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was \"depressed\" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone.\nBut that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.\n\nI thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided \n in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. \nAfter 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. \nThe only way i felt better was with playing runescape.\n\nYEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined\nYear 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy.\nAnd on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. \n\nYear 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. \nAll the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**COLLEGE**\nThis was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study \"orthopedagogie\", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that.\nOfcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE.\nIn my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a \"friend group\". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.\n\nI was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later.\nDuring the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.\n\nI liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. \n\nSo here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money...

I loved starting my days early and just being awake and alive and seeing my family. I loved socializing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, those days are over. Now, on a DAILY basis(No Exaggeration) I CONSTANTLY battle thoughts of suicide everyday. No, i don&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m suicidal, or that I&amp;#39;d ever act on those thoughts. However, every single day i fight myself in my head. I always wonder &amp;quot;Whats the point of life&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s my BIGGEST question. Just to wake up, get stressed out, work, fight with my baby momma, and die? Thats my purpose and intent on this planet? If i&amp;#39;m just going to die eventually, why prolong the inevitable? However i think it is my daughter which keeps my from acting upon that thought. However there has been a few times where I came real close to killing myself, but that was a year or so ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suicide isn&amp;#39;t my only problem. I am STRESSED out beyond belief. Let me lay out my issues. One, I&amp;#39;m borderline homeless. For 4 years ive been couch surfing, house surfing. I&amp;#39;ve had to quit multiple jobs to relocate, and as of now, Im unemployed and on probation for something i didn&amp;#39;t even do. Both of my brothers have tried to fuck the mother of my child. (I just found out today my eldest brother has been recieving not so appropriate pictures from her), I might be getting kicked out of the army for missing a drill last year, the day of drill i hit my breaking point and snapped and thought i should stay home and sort my life out instead of going to the army and being more stressed out. As a result, im being discharged probably. I have like, no money what so ever. I wont be able to buy presents for my daughter for christmas. I&amp;#39;ve asked my mom for help and told her im just about homeless and all she had to say was &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, thats too bad&amp;quot; So now 3 members of my family have just about turned their backs completely towards me. I have to violate probation every single day to leave the county I&amp;#39;m scheduled in, just to have a house to sleep out of of my probation county. My car recently got repossessed from lack of paying my bill because I had got a blood infection that put me out of work and almost killed me and i couldn&amp;#39;t work there anymore cause of my infection. My baby momma uses my daughter as a weapon against me. For example she came to visit and brought my daughter with and the whole time she tried to have sex with me and i refused because of my girlfriend and she got so mad that i denied her she left with my daughter and didn&amp;#39;t even give me a chance to give my child a hug or kiss goodbye or even say goodbye. She just walked out the door with my baby and left. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only that but i just have a EXTREME sense of agitation lately. When me and my girl got together last month I really enjoyed her company. ALOT. Now, she just pisses me off when she talks or even when she does something as simple as takes too long to come and get me. Itll ruin my whole day and i know its wrong to think like that but i seriously cannot help it. Just yesterday i was so mentally exhausted from all this shit i just got down on my knees and started crying. I was punching things and what not. I&amp;#39;m just so unbelievably overwhelmed with stress and being homeless and broke its just a joke. So everyday i fight myself to NOT act upon suicide. Its just so hard for me to give myself a reason to not act on it anymore. Life just seems so...dead. I&amp;#39;m not even social anymore either. I HATE talking to people but id love to talk to people its almost like i dont know how to interact and have a normal conversation with people. If they don&amp;#39;t talk or start a convo, we will just sit in silence. I had quite a few friends at the beginning of this year, and one of them i let borrow my car everynight because he didn&amp;#39;t have his. Come to find out, he was taking my car to the mother of my childs house and doing god knows what. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to involve myself in church and placing faith in something but its hard for me to. I just look at the people at church as sheep following a false god, and i hate that i think that way because they seem to live so nicely and i hate them for it, but i know i shouldn&amp;#39;t. Its starting to seriously effect my relationship with my girlfriend and i just simply am at a loss here. I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. All my friends try to sleep with the mother of my kid, so i don&amp;#39;t have ANY friends anymore. Ive completely isolated myself, ive cut off both of my brothers. My only brothers. My mom is just so addicted to drugs she fucked her whole life up and could give a fuck about my problems or helping me. She could easily give me a roof over my head but thats too much to ask i guess. Its just all this crap that has been PILING up this year has finally pushed me over the edge. I just have no pleasure in life anymore. When i smile, i have to force myself to smile. I don&amp;#39;t want to live like this anymore. I want to be happy. I want to be happy and enjoy life SO FUCKING BAD. But i can&amp;#39;t. I need help and i don&amp;#39;t know what else to do because when i try to explain my feelings to people i feel like im bothering them and they could care less so i guess its easier to type it here and have people i don&amp;#39;t know give me some kind of feedback. Theirs so much more crap that goes on in my life i could go on for days but. I won&amp;#39;t. Will someone please give me some help and link me to ways to chill out and relieve stress and not be so pissed off all the time. I want to be happy when im around my girl but i just cant be.

But after a recent 6 month depression and constant bipolar cycles prior, now I feel I do that too much.

My panic disorder has generally improved over time because I have learned coping mechanism and because I have allowed more rational thought to overshadow my health anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I drink at least 7 strong beers a day. I took a break for a week like a month ago to prove to myself that I could and get myself out of alcohol dependence. I&amp;#39;m unemployed after 4 months of graduating a 6-month 9-hours-a-day programming school. My job application rate has been declining. I have a quantitative economics degree that put me in very little debt, but now I am in significantly more debt (because of the programming school and the loan provider), and I&amp;#39;m afraid I won&amp;#39;t be able to get out of it soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been staying in bed all day until I have to leave the house for less than 2 hours to do something.

I only eat because I have to, and it takes effort. I restarted seeing a chemical dependency therapist and started seeing a psychiatrist and who put me on antidepressants, which I am still adjusting to (I hope they will help).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have seen multiple medical professionals and therapists in my recent lifetime. They know about my alcohol use, and I know about its adverse effects on my mental and physical condition. I think it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;chicken or the egg&amp;quot; situation.

My panic disorder has generally improved over time because I have learned coping mechanism and because I have allowed more rational thought to overshadow my health anxiety.\n\nI drink at least 7 strong beers a day. I took a break for a week like a month ago to prove to myself that I could and get myself out of alcohol dependence. I'm unemployed after 4 months of graduating a 6-month 9-hours-a-day programming school. My job application rate has been declining. I have a quantitative economics degree that put me in very little debt, but now I am in significantly more debt (because of the programming school and the loan provider), and I'm afraid I won't be able to get out of it soon enough.\n\nI've been staying in bed all day until I have to leave the house for less than 2 hours to do something. I have anxiety and depression that keeps me from getting out of bed because I don't want to deal with anything, and I hope I don't have anyone trying to contact me when I'm in bed (I hate talking on the phone and don\u2019t want to receive a text or email). I only eat because I have to, and it takes effort. I restarted seeing a chemical dependency therapist and started seeing a psychiatrist and who put me on antidepressants, which I am still adjusting to (I hope they will help).\n\nI have seen multiple medical professionals and therapists in my recent lifetime. They know about my alcohol use, and I know about its adverse effects on my mental and physical condition. I think it's a \"chicken or the egg\" situation. I know I use alcohol to deal with both my anxiety and depression, and I know I should stop. It's not quite as easy as just stopping.\n\nI have strong family and friend support. I just feel like I\u2019m failing myself and my family because I had crazy good potential. I know i have made progress. My therapist has helped me realize that I actually have accomplishments recently, but it\u2019s difficult for me to see those accomplishments.

I know I have been born with amazing opportunities and privileges that many people desire but when my mind wanders to dark places, I find no solace in any of that. My whole life I have struggled with depression and a feeling like I didn't belong and everything would be better if I killed myself, but as a teenager it has only gotten worse and worse. No matter what I am doing sometimes I will be fine one moment and then the next I start to think about every little mistake, award interaction, and mishap I have made in my life and get extremely depressed. My stomach sinks and my chest literally feels like it has a giant hole or void or cavity in it and I just feel empty and worthless. My dad is an abusive manipulative guy so I visit with him as little as possible and live with my mom. My mom is a wonderful woman who works at a stressful hospital job at night to sustain us economically but she is usually asleep or very tired so I am alone most of the time. I have an older brother who is addicted to pills and he lives with my dad but other than that I don't have much other real family because my mom has shunned most of her side.

The doctor said there wasn\u2019t necessarily anything wrong with her and then they did hormone tests where they discovered that her stress hormone levels are really high. \nL further told me that A told her about how she thinks about death a lot lately and that she\u2019s sad all the time.

If you really set your mind to it I bet you could have done it with willpower alone.\n\n\nAnd it makes me sick that you probably didn\u2019t want to. You begged to be taken back there, to get help. And you might have killed yourself on a fucking 51-49 vote. I don\u2019t even know how long it takes to lose consciousness from asphyxiation. I\u2019m afraid to find out. Did you regret it instantly after the point of no return? Did you try to free yourself? You probably could have held yourself up for a while given how in shape you were. You used to love the gym.\n\nI can\u2019t even remember the good times right now. I can just see your face and that\u2019s it.

During my 3.5 years of dealing with depression and it&amp;#39;s staggering residual effects, I have spent a lot of time immobilized... lying in bed thinking when I wished I could muster the get-up-and-go to be up on my feet doing even simple things.  At some points during all this thinking, I&amp;#39;ve tossed around the idea that IF and/or WHEN I am able to get back to a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; state I can accept and feel genuinely good about, and IF/WHEN I am able to maintain that state for a goodly amount of time, I could sort of &amp;quot;adopt&amp;quot; a depressed person who was still having a really rough go of it and try to give them a hand up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounds weird, probably.  Let me explain.  (Please feel free to skip down to the bold text if you aren&amp;#39;t interested in my personal story.)  For all I can tell, a combination of life events, lackluster comprehension of time management strategies, disillusionment about the world, a foolish notion that I should overindulge negative emotions in order to &amp;quot;live life&amp;quot;, and a prevailing perception of impending bullshit and misery (&lt;em&gt;clears throat&lt;/em&gt; academia&amp;#39;ll do that) were culminating in such a way that my mental health was gradually heading downhill.  I didn&amp;#39;t even like to let myself think it, but I can still remember walking through campus on the day before my junior year of college started, having an intuitive thought that the year ahead was going to be a tough one.  I didn&amp;#39;t even know why, but although the thought was tiny, it was unshakable; my subconscious realized things my conscious didn&amp;#39;t, I guess.  I should have called my mom, called my roommate/best friend, called a sibling, climbed onto the veranda roof and shouted, &amp;quot;Hey, I&amp;#39;m gonna need some help here,&amp;quot; ANYTHING to make sure I made my physical and mental health top priority before the year even started.  But I didn&amp;#39;t, and my damn-near perfect academic record was ruined in the years to come.  I digress.  I should have at least straightened out my shitty sleep cycle and lack of exercise.  The straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back and sent me into my actual sustained depressive episode was (as far as my PCP and I can tell) some physical problem/imbalance that had more or less corrected itself by the time I actually reached out for help and slunk into a doctor&amp;#39;s office.  (So, yay, my body at least half-ass fixed itself, but I will always be curious what the hell the underlying cause was.  Possibly thyroid related, believe it or not.  This is what happens when your ability to seek and accept help doesn&amp;#39;t coincide with the darkest days when physical problems might be easiest to catch.)  I had borderline abnormal levels of several things, but there were no outstanding signs.  The point here is, I feel like there&amp;#39;s hope for me, yet I have still lived through some days/weeks/months where &amp;quot;shit got real&amp;quot; so maybe I could use this experience to help someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was stubborn and refused drugs because even on my worst days, EVEN THOUGH I ABSOLUTELY HATED everything I had become and felt there was no point in living, there was always an ember of love for myself, and a faith that I could get better.  I felt that as long as I knew that in some minuscule respect, I could still love myself... then there was still hope.  Also, I had been very healthy all my 20 years prior, and people had correctly (I think) touted me as one of most unflappable, mentally stable people they knew all my 20 years prior... so I felt my history and rehab potential was good.  I was actually able to regain some vitality, emotion, give-a-damn, energy, and feeling of connection to the people around me through slow, painstaking work on myself (i.e. a lot of cognitive-behavioral exercises... never knew my psych minor would get so personal).  Have I been able to restore myself to my never-depressed, youthful glory?  No, not close.  Can I see the light at the end of the tunnel?  Most days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOLD TEXT TO SIGNIFY ACTUAL EXPLANATION&lt;/strong&gt;  One of the biggest things that helped me was being able to put myself &amp;quot;through the motions&amp;quot; of a healthy life.  It was really fucking hard, and I don&amp;#39;t really know how I managed sometimes.  Reading other posts here, I know doing regular life stuff doesn&amp;#39;t help everybody, though I think that some depressed individuals do still have goals they care about, and these are the ones who would benefit.  It was like, even though I would sort of numbly go to class here and there and do my bare minimum of homework, the more I was able to make myself do it, &lt;em&gt;the more I was able to make myself do it&lt;/em&gt;.  It was a positive spiral.  The more I did, the more tiny tastes of success (and serotonin, I expect) I got.  I may not have been able to savor much of any such taste in the beginning, but eventually the little positive events began to break through the ice of my frozen brain.  The more active I was, the more good habits began to regrow.  (How I had missed them!)  This would have all been easier if I had had an extremely committed &amp;quot;depression sponsor&amp;quot;.  All my life (beforehand) I had always acted as my own best friend and caretaker, and all through my depression that was what I wished for most.  I couldn&amp;#39;t be my own best friend then, but I think if I&amp;#39;d had someone who considered my their friend and pet cause, my recovery would have been faster.  Of course I felt too worthless to ask this much of anyone I cared for at the time, but now I would be happy to be this type of friend for someone else (once I feel sufficiently healed, if I make it there).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m talking about.  Sponsorship.  Husbandry of the depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you had a friend (with a lot of free time, or with a schedule that meshes well with whatever you&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing) who could be there when you&amp;#39;re supposed to get up in the morning.  If they don&amp;#39;t hear you getting out of bed after your alarm, they walk in and say, &amp;quot;Good morning.  How do you feel?&amp;quot;  You say, &amp;quot;Shitty,&amp;quot; maybe, so they ask, &amp;quot;Really?  Are you in physical pain?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;No, but I feel like I&amp;#39;ve a weight of 200lb holding me to this bed.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ah well, the important part there is &amp;#39;No&amp;#39;, so come on, you can do it,&amp;quot; and they reach out a hand and pull you up.  They don&amp;#39;t put you down, but they don&amp;#39;t take no for an answer.  Get up at the same time enough times, and a good habit will begin to form.  It won&amp;#39;t make it easy, but it will make it harder to defeat yourself.  (And at least if you must be depressed, you can still be functional, perhaps.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you had someone who would happily listen to your problems so you didn&amp;#39;t feel alone, and who also didn&amp;#39;t need an explanation of why things were so hard for you (or why you hadn&amp;#39;t done things already, or how can you possibly feel like you&amp;#39;re separated from the rest of society by a plate glass window).  Someone to say, &amp;quot;True, your situation sucks, but we can improve it.  Let&amp;#39;s investigate what small steps are needed to do that.&amp;quot;  They could stay by your side while you were at home to keep you as active as possible.  They could help you get your ass to class/work.  A body in motion tends to stay in motion; a body at rest tends to stay at rest.  You could sit down and accountably, logically determine what your goals are and what steps will be taken to achieve them.  Someone not to be &amp;quot;your mother&amp;quot; necessarily... more like someone to be your conscience... like Jiminy Cricket on your shoulder.  Someone who beats your self-defeating thoughts with a big-ol&amp;#39; stick and reminds you that simple triumphs are the &amp;quot;little things&amp;quot; in life that are actually pretty important.  Someone to distract you when you start into a vicious cycle of negative thoughts and hatred for the world around you.  Someone to call your other friends and family on their bullshit.  Someone to say, &amp;quot;Why the hell are you on Facebook?  You&amp;#39;re enabling your own insomnia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying it would cure anyone, but I think it could help.  It would be like rehab that follows you home.  (Seeing a psychologist didn&amp;#39;t seem to help because I would feel good/almost normal when I was in the office, but by the time I got home I&amp;#39;d fall into my old patterns again.  Isolation was not good.  Also, the psychologist was not the professor of knowledge I had expected/hoped for.)  I&amp;#39;m also not saying people should always avoid drugs;  I believe that&amp;#39;s probably the best route for some, but not for me personally.  Even now that I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;stuck in the fishbowl&amp;quot;, hell, I could still use a friend like this sometimes.  (I pretty much know my current daily life encourages me to procrastinate and retain my depressive slowness, no matter how much I hate it... sometimes I feel like if I had a friend here to point the fact out to others, they&amp;#39;d believe it and become more supportive/less enabling in turn.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I insane?  Has anyone else ever thought, &amp;quot;If I ever beat this, I&amp;#39;m going to be exactly the kind of help for someone else that I wish I&amp;#39;d had myself?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This subreddit has shown me so many comments that echo my own thoughts; it's so validating!

But I&amp;#39;ve lost all the hope I have. I have a vision, a dream, of how I see my life in the future, but my depression tells me that that will never happen.

But I needed the money, and my dreams won't make me \"rich\" instantly, it would take time anyway.\n\nI have to be away from my beloved boyfriend. We both have our duties and the month of December will be extremely busy, mostly for him, so we most probably won't see each other at all, or only a couple of times within the month. I hate being away from him because he makes me feel safe and loved (please don't comment how it's not okay to rely on someone else for your happiness, I know it myself, but I'm honestly sad when he's not around). He keeps reassuring me that it's just a rough patch, a rough month and if we work hard enough eventually we will get to move in together and we will see each other so much we'll get sick of each other. He says that's what keeps him going.\n\nBut I'm so fucking miserable. I've let depression take over me. I was so depressed these last few months and I honestly thought and believed that getting a job, getting out of my house etc would make me feel better. But it has made me feel even worse. Sure I'm not thinking about death as much as I was last month. But I still get waves of panic of being stuck in my life, living. Being stuck in a job I don't see a future in. \n\nI'm so scared I'll be stuck in this 9-5 job at a shop. Doing the same damn thing every day. Not achieving my dreams because I dream too big and they're so unreachable (if anyone's curious about these dreams for any reason at all, I'll gladly tell you or pm you, just ask.)\n\nMy parents keep telling me that I'm only 20 and that you'll never know what life brings (tbh this job kind of just fell into my lap as well, it was kind of a spontaneous decision to take it). But I've lost all the hope I have. I have a vision, a dream, of how I see my life in the future, but my depression tells me that that will never happen. And quite frankly I believe it.

I&amp;#39;m usually a decent student, but lately I&amp;#39;ve been feeling completely unmotivated to do work and dissatisfied with what I&amp;#39;m doing. I&amp;#39;m currently completely behind in most of my classes. Do I want to do better and catch up? Heck yeah! Do I really have the energy to? Not really. I can have all of the information in front of me for a homework assignment, including an online cheat sheet, but I&amp;#39;ll just sit there and look at it. I could just write a few things down and call it good enough, but for some reason I just can&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t know why; and that leads itself into a vicious cycle. I don&amp;#39;t know why I feel unmotivated, which makes me angry at myself because I know I can do everything I need to. That in and of itself just makes me more unmotivated because I know I&amp;#39;ll just make myself more angry at myself. So I&amp;#39;ll just sit and look at my assignment, sometimes mustering up the energy to pick up my pencil, only to drop it on the table a few seconds later without doing anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivation. This is a big one for me. I used to love doing things like going outside and running, playing games with friends, or even watching news. I prided myself at my athleticism, gaming skill, and general political knowledge. Nowadays, I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to open the door to go outside. I can&amp;#39;t even start up a game on Steam. Just clicking the play button takes too much effort, dedication and commitment for me. News is completely different, because, you know, the 2016 election happened, and every news source just spiraled downward into whatever they do now. But as I said before, I don&amp;#39;t know why I can&amp;#39;t do anything. I know that all I have to do is click a little button, and something that is MADE FOR ENJOYMENT will appear on my screen. And, as before, my inability to do so just makes me upset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I moved into high school, I never quite fit in. Now, I came from a small K-8 school where everybody knew everyone and their mothers, so there wasn&amp;#39;t a need to &amp;quot;fit in.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m doing school of choice, so on top of being on a campus a hundred and a half times larger than my old school, there are like 10 people I know. Those people all went their own ways and almost look at me like a stranger. So, as expected, I had to make friends, which was difficult. I&amp;#39;m pretty reserved and won&amp;#39;t go out of my way to meet new people, so as of three years of just existing in school, I amassed a group of around five or so friends. And I use the term &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; very loosely because I really just kinda know them and feel somewhat comfortable making conversation with them. I&amp;#39;ve never seen them as people that I can relate to or that I would go out of my way to spend more time with. I almost feel as if they just let me hang around them because it&amp;#39;s just the nice thing to do, or because no one else will do it. So, with all that being said, on a campus of hundreds of people and familiar faces, I have never felt so alone in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard somewhere that a good thing to do when you&amp;#39;re alone is to be creative. I always geared myself towards math and science, so being creative is something that i&amp;#39;m really not too familiar with. I decided that I should write a book. I think I started June of 2017 because I remember working on it at my Grandmother&amp;#39;s cottage that I went to in the summer. Unlike a lot of what I&amp;#39;ve written in this post so far, I&amp;#39;m actually slightly happy with it. I feel as if I can think freely and convey emotion through characters and descriptions. I don&amp;#39;t plan on publishing it or really having anyone read it, but I guess I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I&amp;#39;ve been listening to a lot of music recently. I&amp;#39;m pretty picky when it comes to music, so I stay with a band that my brother introduced me to way back in sixth grade. I never really understood the lyrics back then; I just liked the beats and the guitars and the break from my mother&amp;#39;s damned country music. Anyway, I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of soul searching in these songs. I feel like a song, even one I haven&amp;#39;t written, is such a reliable and powerful way to convey emotions and feelings without sitting down and just talking about it. If some of you are deep music junkies or just want to know what I mean, I have some of the most powerful song lines (imo). Otherwise, feel free to skip over; I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of music that people put their soul into that I just plain don&amp;#39;t like. I get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not, I&amp;#39;m not myself. I feel like I&amp;#39;m someone else. Fallen and faceless, so hollow, hollow inside.

I have struggled with depression. I&amp;#39;ve had this struggle for awhile, actually. When I was in my junior year of high school I started noticing some of the symptoms and eventually had a talk with my parents. We went to my doctor, he asked me a bunch of questions and checked my physical health, and then I was prescribed with an anti-depressant for depression and social anxiety. I can&amp;#39;t quite explain how thankful I am for that medicine. Actually, I should be saying that I can&amp;#39;t quite explain how thankful I am for the God who created the ingredients that make up that medicine (for those who say, &amp;quot;But why do you need medicine if you can just pray to God to help you get over it?&amp;quot;, I point you to 1 Timothy 5:23).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before that time during my eleventh year of school I kept things hidden inside. I didn&amp;#39;t open up about my problems because I thought something was wrong with me. Yes, something was wrong with me, but not in the way I believed. So I hid my sickness and things got worse. I avoided people. I got nervous hanging around friends. I lost certain feelings. I became rather numb, at times. I sweated a lot. I probably started developing sleeping problems, but I can&amp;#39;t really remember. None of this stuff came about because of some traumatic event. I just randomly developed these mental incongruities. Oftentimes people with depression feel sad or feel numb for no reason at all, which is possibly the most frustrating part of all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until I took a zero on a big project in English that I realized how much this problem affected me. That was a huge eye-opener, because usually I was a very meticulous and &amp;quot;perfectionist&amp;quot; type student. I always worked hard to get A&amp;#39;s, but that semester in English I just didn&amp;#39;t care. I just wanted to avoid talking in front of people. I could suffer a B this time if it meant not talking in a class of twenty people for five minutes. Lame, right? It&amp;#39;s not so lame when you put yourself in the shoes of someone who has a chemical imbalance in his or her brain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zoom forward a few months. I&amp;#39;ve been on 75 mg of Effexor, things are getting better, and I have a much clearer head. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe the changes I had in my life. I wasn&amp;#39;t so nervous and anxious all the time. I could eventually speak in front of people again. I didn&amp;#39;t avoid being around people. Then came my first time to miss a day taking my pill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether I was negligent and didn&amp;#39;t turn in my refill in time or just forgot to take it, I managed to miss taking my 75 mg of magical stuff for an entire day. If you&amp;#39;ve ever been on an anti-depressant, you know this is a big no-no. Oh man, was it awful. My emotions were at their peak. I could have cried at the sound of a cat&amp;#39;s meow. My dreams were so vivid and real. My head went through the worst headache it&amp;#39;s ever been through. The withdrawal was horrible and I would never wish that feeling upon my worst enemy (unless depression were a person). Over the past twelve years I have had random times where I have missed a day and it&amp;#39;s always awful. It&amp;#39;s what I imagine a person on meth and cocaine and heroin feels like (yes, taking all three at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I have managed to be much more &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. The medication has definitely helped, but a few years back I had to up my dose during a difficult time (some anti-depressants lose their punch after you&amp;#39;ve been using them for awhile). Although Effexor has helped immensely, I cannot simply rely on a little pill (that I sadly cannot swallow because I&amp;#39;m one of those weirdos who cannot swallow pills). I still get depressed. I still get anxious. I still have problems that have their moments. I&amp;#39;m a stubborn mule who has refused to go to therapy, although it is well-known that therapy is one of the best helps for mental illnesses. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll change that (probably not).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to exercise regularly, which can also be helpful. I don&amp;#39;t know how to turn off my mind, though. That&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve yet to figure out. My mind runs faster than my feet on the treadmill and I want it to slow down. It exhausts me, but it also keeps me from getting adequate sleep. A catch-22, if I ever saw one. In fact, I am laying here in bed at 3:28 am writing this piece. If my picture is next to the word &amp;quot;insomnia&amp;quot; in some dictionary, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not write all of this to make you feel sorry for me or to play the victim. We are all victims of something, I suppose. We all have struggles that we are trying to defeat or endure. I honestly can&amp;#39;t say exactly why I chose to write all of this about my depression. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about depression a lot lately, so maybe this is just an overflow of my thoughts. Maybe I wrote this to show you all that having a mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe I wrote it to help tire out my mind enough to get some sleep. Whatever the case, I hope that you can take something from it and use it for good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the words of J.K. Rowling, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s so difficult to explain depression to someone who&amp;#39;s never been there, because it&amp;#39;s not just sadness.&amp;quot; I hope you never have to be there, but if you are, I am here to talk with you if you need someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have a confession to make.

I just wanted to avoid talking in front of people. I could suffer a B this time if it meant not talking in a class of twenty people for five minutes. Lame, right? It's not so lame when you put yourself in the shoes of someone who has a chemical imbalance in his or her brain.\n\nZoom forward a few months. I've been on 75 mg of Effexor, things are getting better, and I have a much clearer head. I couldn't believe the changes I had in my life. I wasn't so nervous and anxious all the time. I could eventually speak in front of people again. I didn't avoid being around people. Then came my first time to miss a day taking my pill.\n\nWhether I was negligent and didn't turn in my refill in time or just forgot to take it, I managed to miss taking my 75 mg of magical stuff for an entire day. If you've ever been on an anti-depressant, you know this is a big no-no. Oh man, was it awful. My emotions were at their peak. I could have cried at the sound of a cat's meow. My dreams were so vivid and real. My head went through the worst headache it's ever been through. The withdrawal was horrible and I would never wish that feeling upon my worst enemy (unless depression were a person). Over the past twelve years I have had random times where I have missed a day and it's always awful. It's what I imagine a person on meth and cocaine and heroin feels like (yes, taking all three at the same time).\n\nAll in all, I have managed to be much more \"normal\". The medication has definitely helped, but a few years back I had to up my dose during a difficult time (some anti-depressants lose their punch after you've been using them for awhile). Although Effexor has helped immensely, I cannot simply rely on a little pill (that I sadly cannot swallow because I'm one of those weirdos who cannot swallow pills). I still get depressed. I still get anxious. I still have problems that have their moments. I'm a stubborn mule who has refused to go to therapy, although it is well-known that therapy is one of the best helps for mental illnesses. Maybe I'll change that (probably not).\n\nI try to exercise regularly, which can also be helpful. I don't know how to turn off my mind, though. That's something I've yet to figure out. My mind runs faster than my feet on the treadmill and I want it to slow down. It exhausts me, but it also keeps me from getting adequate sleep. A catch-22, if I ever saw one. In fact, I am laying here in bed at 3:28 am writing this piece. If my picture is next to the word \"insomnia\" in some dictionary, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nI do not write all of this to make you feel sorry for me or to play the victim. We are all victims of something, I suppose. We all have struggles that we are trying to defeat or endure. I honestly can't say exactly why I chose to write all of this about my depression. I've been thinking about depression a lot lately, so maybe this is just an overflow of my thoughts. Maybe I wrote this to show you all that having a mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. I don't know. Maybe I wrote it to help tire out my mind enough to get some sleep. Whatever the case, I hope that you can take something from it and use it for good.\n\nIn the words of J.K. Rowling, \"It's so difficult to explain depression to someone who's never been there, because it's not just sadness.\" I hope you never have to be there, but if you are, I am here to talk with you if you need someone.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7htbia", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My Twelve Year Battle With Depression", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7htbia", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/7htbia/my_twelve_year_battle_with_depression/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "stickied": false, "created": 1512541159.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7htbia/my_twelve_year_battle_with_depression/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "pngpng32", "created_utc": 1512512359.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_specified", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.depression", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "depression", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am depressed but I feel very happy often.

It&amp;#39;s been around six years since I&amp;#39;ve felt this way, part way through high school I began to feel very inadequate as everyone had girlfriends and were in relationships while I was alone. I truly began to feel like I would never meet anyone, so it was a huge surprise to me when in the last year of school a girl that I had been friends with and really liked asked me to go to prom with her. After, we began dating and I was the happiest I been in my whole life, I felt like someone actually cared about me. Unfortunately this didn&amp;#39;t last long, after about a month she stopped talking to me and months passed without contact before she eventually sent me a text message to break up. At that point I just sort of gave up, I became severely depressed and just smoked weed to try and get over my problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was four years ago. I&amp;#39;ve worked a lousy job only a few days a week, living with my parents and doing literally nothing but smoking and playing video games, all the while pretending that I&amp;#39;m mentally okay. Most of my friends from high school are gone and really only two are left, I have more online but I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m that close to any of them. I never really tried to get help... something I immensely regret every single day. I&amp;#39;m like my father, he doesn&amp;#39;t talk about or express his emotions to others. Trying to talk with me about my emotions is like talking to a brick wall. It&amp;#39;s always been easier for me to just ignore my feelings and just escape by smoking or playing video games, or watching something. I&amp;#39;ve dreaded the thought about talking about my emotions to my parents and others... but I realize now I have to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve already wasted so much of my life... I&amp;#39;m only 22, but the last four years have just been an utter waste. I&amp;#39;ve made a bit of money but I&amp;#39;ve done literally nothing, it&amp;#39;s just been the same exact thing every week. I feel so much regret and self-hate for what I&amp;#39;ve done... I&amp;#39;m not suicidal, but I do wish I didn&amp;#39;t exist, that I was just never born in the first place. If my life continues like this, I will no doubt turn suicidal eventually. Already I sometimes feel urges to hurt myself... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, today I will be opening up to my best friend about how I&amp;#39;ve felt. He&amp;#39;s been depressed in the past, quite a long time ago as he&amp;#39;s in a much better place now with a girlfriend. But I know he cares about me, and I think he can understand how I feel, even if just a little. What I&amp;#39;m really worried about is telling my mother... she is bi-polar and often worries a lot, this is mostly why I&amp;#39;ve kept my feelings a secret for so long. Telling her and talking about my emotions is going to be incredibly hard, but I have to do this. I&amp;#39;m going to quit my job this week, just the thought of that feels liberating, I can start trying to get help and maybe, just maybe I can try to go to university next year... If not, the year after that. I&amp;#39;m so scared to open up after all this isolation... I don&amp;#39;t know if I can. It&amp;#39;s so hard for me to explain just how I feel even on here. The song And All That Could Have Been by Nine Inch Nails can better explain how I feel than I ever could, but a warning it is an incredibly depressing song... I attach particular meaning to it as it I listened to it an awful lot when my girlfriend broke up with me, I can hardly ever listen to it because of how depressed it makes me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would greatly appreciate any advice with opening up about my feelings, I&amp;#39;m confused where to even begin... For a long time I&amp;#39;ve felt like it&amp;#39;s been too late to get help, but I want to believe that isn&amp;#39;t true. As much as I wish I was dead my life can&amp;#39;t end like that.

Without it I\u2019m having trouble sleeping and feel like I just can\u2019t relax and let go of my problems anymore.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m overly sad but just.....numb I suppose. I have an ok job which pays the bills and keeps food on my table but it\u2019s not a career. I\u2019ve never really been passionate about any particular career and with rent to pay and the job market (in the UK anyway) I can\u2019t afford I take a major risk.\n\nI just seem to be going through the motions rather then doing anything out of passion or joy. I\u2019ve come here to seek help or advice from others in my position.

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old guy and I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for around 3 years, looked for help a year ago and have been diagnosed, medicated and attended to therapy. But nothing is working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been kind of melancholic, but nothing too bad, then 3 years ago everything changed. Steadily, I entered a state of numbness, no feelings no ambitions, no interest for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a pretty good life, started a degree I liked in college, had good friends, a loving family, an amazing girlfriend. But this sensation, this void, this new me started taking it all away from me. Being distant ended up pushing my girlfriend away and she cheated on me (she is mostly responsible for it, but can&amp;#39;t ignore my part to blame), I started skipping classes, just because, just to lie in bed looking at the ceiling, and thus started failing, because of the poor grades I started having fights with my parents... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel my life falling apart like dominoes, and I could do nothing to stop it, I tried, I tried to fight, talked to my friends, who tried to help but didn&amp;#39;t really know how, so eventually ended up bored of it so I stopped, resourced to drugs, alcohol: ended up doing stupid shit I felt ashamed of later, like hurting myself and punching walls and stuff; weed: got me into an even deeper state of numbness, stayed for hours in a couch looking at the wall. For that reason skipped psychodelic drugs and stepped directly into cocaine, which made me dance and do fun stuff, but the feeling the day after was so terrible I stopped. Well, I don&amp;#39;t know what I expected, but it didn&amp;#39;t help, at the time I didn&amp;#39;t really know I was depressed, I just thought it was a bad season, a temporary bump in the road. But it didn&amp;#39;t go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more things I lost, the more accentuated the state was. So after a couple of years I started to plan my suicide. It was systematic, cold, seemed completely rational. Started looking for the location, the way, how to make it look like an accident so my loved ones (that I still had, and have) wouldn&amp;#39;t be too hurt, thought of what to say to them... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I snapped, something inside of me still tried to fight. So I looked for help, found a therapist, a good one and eventually a psychiatrist who gave me medication, talked to my parents and friends about it. I was determined to fight, and win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost a year passed since then, I didn&amp;#39;t feel better at all, and that made me feel even worse than I was, I felt myself failing. The situation made my friends uncomfortable, so I learnt to fake it. I kept the talking to my family at the bare minimum, can&amp;#39;t look them in the eye. Stopped taking the pills, they turned me into an absolute zombie. My therapist helped at first, but then I felt all the exercises, the steps and everything were bullshit, wasn&amp;#39;t helping me at all so I also stopped going. I know it&amp;#39;s all bad choices, again, yet I couldn&amp;#39;t bear that lifestyle anymore. It was making me have bad thoughts again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But didn&amp;#39;t surrender yet, I decided to take yet another approach, I managed not to mess up my studies completely and could apply for a semester abroad, so I did, I thought meeting new people, being in a new place, knowing a new culture could make me change to a new me. But it&amp;#39;s not. It&amp;#39;s been 4 months and I still feel the same, I still can&amp;#39;t sleep, can&amp;#39;t focus, can&amp;#39;t feel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still have some energy left, but I feel it running out. The part of me that wants to keep fighting is still there, but I feel it loosing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone will read this, or what I expected by writing it but but I&amp;#39;m trying to clutch to straws, so if anyone has an idea of how to help, I would appreciate it, at least it would keep me going for a bit longer.

It has now been 8+ months and heres the thing; during the past 8 months, 3 of them went really well for me. This was my only Serious relationship and I loved this women with all my heart and still do... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lived in Canada all my life before moving to Haiti with my father right after the huge earthquake in 2010. He worked with the redcross and he met a Belgian woman, who is now my step-mom. Fast forward a couple of years, we all move to Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First couple of months were really hard, abandoning all my friends from Montreal to move to Haiti was already hard, but from the start we knew we&amp;#39;d go back to Montreal &amp;quot;soon&amp;quot; and I had family there, It was actually one of the best moment in my life when i think about it now... Belgium was different, all the kids my age (15y/o) were super immature, so I could  never feel &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot; with them. The two years I spent in Haiti I was home schooled kinda unregularely. Thay put me a bit behind most of the others... 6 months into my Belgium journey I start dating a girl i&amp;#39;ve been heavily speaking to for a month. We were kinda shy at first but I knew I liked her a lot and that, THAT was new to me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were together for almost 2 years, 2 of the 3 years I had spent in Belgium (at the time of our break-up)  were spent by her side, her being the center of my World. We didnt laugh like crazy all the time, hell we couldnt even find conversations sometimes (alot) but it just felt so good... Untill she started being distant... We got in a couple of serious fights and one crazy stupid full of regrets night we ended our relationship...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;#39;ve been going to hell and back quite regularely... I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep at first, spent most of my days crying. I completely stopped school, I couldnt see her without crying... I couldn&amp;#39;t eat, I couldnt speak to people, I busted my knuckles on a brick wall, I couldnt use my hands, in short my life was going to shit I wanted to DIE. (not to k*ll myself)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first week or so was terrible, I tried talking to her a couple of times, she cried when we spoke, she said she loved me just that we couldnt work out... The rest of the month was harsh but I was learning to cope with my emotions and it went by. We didnt speak much at all, we spoke in person once or twice and a couple other times on social media. I would tell her I still love her, which she would sometimes answer that she does to. She would tell me about her life at home and stuff. I knew her whole family a n d her brother still considers me like a brother, loved the guy too...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another month goes by and she tells me she&amp;#39;s seeing someone else, when I&amp;#39;m finally starting to feel better about myself. She BREAKS me again amd tortured the fuck out of me for another month. She then told me she ended everything with the other dude because she thinks of me all the time, she wants to talk to me when she&amp;#39;s lonely etc etc and she felt like she was doing him wrong. I thibk she was just looking for a rebound from our relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From that moment we started speaking a little more regularely. My trip to Montreal (first in 3 years) was really soon and I needed to say sorry for the things I said to her when she told me she was seeing that other dude. Nothing vulgar or anything I was just talking with emotions and I was mean to her. She accepted my apologies, matter of fact she didnt even take it back when i lashed out on her... She can be an angel sometimes.... We hugged for like 3 minutes and said goodbye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to Montreal, thats 4 months after the break up. I really went HAM! I tried a bunch of drugs for the first time, fell in love with molly, abused the hell out of her. Fell in love with Xanax, abused the fuck out of them, I hate cocaine and Ketamine bahhhh! Reunited with all my old friends, old hook ups, a couple of new ones. I got my first job, a cook and a damned GOOD one at that... I was getting soooo much appreciation from everybody around me that I didnt think of her all the time. I barely thought if her to tell the truth.\nOnly time where I would think about her was when I was having sex, I needed to picture us having sex to be able to finish or else i just go limp after fighting 30 minutes for a nut lol. Thats bad i thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started talking a lot more when I was in montreal, I missed her and told her, she missed me and told me. She had just moved out in an other town for school (Uni) so she was feeling a bit lonely, she would tell me about her all the time, how she was doing and everything. To me, it seemed like we had more to talk about then when we were together. We were talking so much that at one point she even said how much she would like it if I came to see her in her new city whenever I&amp;#39;d be back... Since the break up, I was the only one that had asked that we see eachother, now she had. And even if it&amp;#39;s because she felt lonely and in distress cuz of school, SHE WAS FUCKING WAITING ON ME!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, I dipped into drugs quite a bit when on vacation in Montreal and this one time she saw a couple pf xanax pills on a table in my snapchat story, they werent mine but i had taken one 2mg (which is more than enough to get you quite high). She confronted me quite agressively and I took it really bad, and since then she hasnt spoken to me.\nI got mad at her for that and kinda forgot her for a while but obviously as soon as I landed in Belgium I was thinking of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing to serious at first just a quick thought thats it. Sometimes i could feel off all day because i would think of her but nothing really crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2-3 weeks ago i was feeling really low and tried to talk to her (she really helps me) but she rejected me really hard, she kicked me at my lowest... Shit just went crazy from then... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will have a bunch of good days but I dream of her almost every night (this is recent) usually it goes unoticed but yesterday something odd happened and I spent most of my day holding in tears, the rest of the day I was crying like crazy...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today is fine-ish, I tried talking to her yesterday but once i told her i wasnt feeling well she hit the road again left me to hang... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to think...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt better in Montreal but I&amp;#39;m wondering if it&amp;#39;s not just because I was on a party vybe for 3 months and I did a whole lot of drugs, anti-depressants to... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to talk to her so bad, ask her if she still feels anything for me but im too afraid that she says no, I want to ask her why she&amp;#39;s been kicking me when i&amp;#39;m down instead of helping me recently.
