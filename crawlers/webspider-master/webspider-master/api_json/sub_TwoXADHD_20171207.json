I can't keep my house clean for anything but I can diagnose your obscure disease when several actual doctors have failed to do so. What the heck is this?\n\nIs this maybe ADHD? I brought it up to my therapist but she brushed it off. Whether it's ADHD or something else I feel like what I am dealing with is not normal. Autism maybe? -But I have no issue with social situations, I find them exhausting and dull but I can read a room and act the part when it's required of me. \n\nTL;DR: I'm super unorganized, forgetful, and overwhelmed with responsibilities. I'm fully capable in more complex areas of my life, but can't seem to keep up with little things like keeping the house clean.\n\nEdit: I took the ADHD self test for women (on the sidebar) and scored 81%. It likely would have been higher but I wasn't sure what to say about the check book. I'm fine at managing my finances, but I suppose online banking and auto withdrawals play a large part in that.

She continued to insist that you cannot diagnose ADHD in someone with anxiety that isn&amp;#39;t well controlled (and we have been TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY USING HER PLAN to control it for over a year.)  We argued and argued and finally we convinced her to do a trial  because what we&amp;#39;ve been doing isn&amp;#39;t working and if we try it and it works, we&amp;#39;ll know it was ADHD the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned to the computer and put in the prescription then turned back to us and lectured us on how this wasn&amp;#39;t her best advice and she wants us to know we&amp;#39;re responsible for whatever happens because our child DOES NOT have ADHD but she&amp;#39;d see if this would help her anxiety, although she was sure it would not and would cause her hallucinations and more panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she gave her Adderall 5mg XR.  I didn&amp;#39;t even know they made doses that low.  She said in a month if it doesn&amp;#39;t work and there&amp;#39;s no bad effects she&amp;#39;ll increase it.

That&amp;#39;s how it went.  Still on a waiting list for a different clinic.  I really, really hate this doctor.

It&amp;#39;s bad enough when society treats this disorder like a joke, but to have that attitude from a doctor who is supposed to specialize in these kinds of issues? Insulting. I hate her. :( I cried while my husband drove home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: It was awful, doctor is a bitch, gave daughter a very low dose of Adderall, made me cry. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So we went to the psychiatrist today.

We argued and argued and finally we convinced her to do a trial  because what we've been doing isn't working and if we try it and it works, we'll know it was ADHD the whole time.\n\nShe turned to the computer and put in the prescription then turned back to us and lectured us on how this wasn't her best advice and she wants us to know we're responsible for whatever happens because our child DOES NOT have ADHD but she'd see if this would help her anxiety, although she was sure it would not and would cause her hallucinations and more panic attacks.\n\nSo she gave her Adderall 5mg XR.  I didn't even know they made doses that low.  She said in a month if it doesn't work and there's no bad effects she'll increase it.  I'm kind of pissed because my kid is having trouble NOW and failing classes NOW and in danger of being kicked out of band and choir NOW, and I turned down Wellbutrin and Strattera for her because I know that when i started on Adderall it was like a night and day difference pretty quickly.  \n\nSo.  That's how it went.  Still on a waiting list for a different clinic.  I really, really hate this doctor.  I feel like she doesn't understand ADHD and she doesn't think it's a big deal.  I was ready to kill myself before I got my diagnosis.  It's bad enough when society treats this disorder like a joke, but to have that attitude from a doctor who is supposed to specialize in these kinds of issues? Insulting. I hate her. :( I cried while my husband drove home. \n\nTL;DR: It was awful, doctor is a bitch, gave daughter a very low dose of Adderall, made me cry.

I was in my diagnosing process, and was very open with my coworkers, and one of the girls joked about popping one of my pills and having a party/use it for studying almost every time she saw me taking my medicine. \nI feel like I have a responsibility for my medicine and that no one abuses it, and not being able to trust the people in your surroundings feels horrible. \n\nDo any of you have experiences with feeling like this?

My sister was diagnosed last year, and I had been surprised because I thought of ADHD as a hyperactive kid thing. I researched it and was surprised to see so much of myself in the descriptions. I thought, well, maybe I have it, but I&amp;#39;m dealing pretty well with it, so no need to seek medical help/meds/etc. Then the end of term came for me and I fell apart at the end of term when I had to sit down and edit videos/create computer animation for three end of term projects.

She doubted my suspicions but gave me a Wellbutrin rx and sent me to be evaluated anyway. I wen to counselor.

I am so glad I have an explanation for all these problems I have in my life I thought I was just a lazy bum for!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the appt after that with my PCP to talk about meds. There was a doctor in training (don&amp;#39;t know the proper term, sorry). The doctor in training went first and talking with him was wonderful. He was careful to listen and ask lots of follow up questions, patient with me when I went down rabbit trails, listened to my concerns with meds and life stuff. Then my PCP came in. She basically starting talking without listening to me, saying she was concerned I had something other than ADHD, maybe bipolar disorder, because of my anxiety and some postpartum depression I had after my fourth kid. I raised big questions here because I have never been diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I asked why she was saying I have anxiety and she said, you had the PPD and there was the whole thing with your vaginal stuff years ago. I asked if that was the time I was trying to troubleshoot vaginal stuff due to painful sex and she said yes. I said, I don&amp;#39;t see how that&amp;#39;s anxiety, that was me trying to troubleshoot a painful condition and seeking medical care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The crazy thing about both those references is that right after I had my fourth and had PPD, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which I have been treated for since. The vaginal thing (which was me going to her, a gynecologist, then back to my PCP, she wound up diagnosing as bacterial vaginosis and giving me antibiotics for, which cleared up the problem (and I had had BV before a few times.) After that big fiasco, I started taking daily probiotics, and I haven&amp;#39;t had the old BV since and sex is back to normal. If she really thought my vaginal pain was anxiety back then, why did she diagnose it as BV and give me an antibiotic for it and never suggest I see the counselor?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been diagnosed previously with premenstrual disorder (forgot the actual name but PMDD is the initials) and tried zoloft for it a few years ago, after six weeks saw no improvements and nasty side effects from the zoloft. So I haven&amp;#39;t sought other meds for that, more tried supplementing with magnesium and stuff since. The main symptom I have is a lot of irritation before my period, having a lack of patience and tending to snap at my kids is the main symptom, a bit extra social anxiety and wondering if there&amp;#39;s something wrong with me that scares people away. It doesn&amp;#39;t get worse than that, so I haven&amp;#39;t really seen it as a priority to treat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did actually see the counselor for insomnia issues. She gave me great suggestions and relaxation techniques, and although I still have insomnia occasionally, especially related to my period or stressful times in my life, I really think it makes more sense to relate it to my ADHD, because the things that keep me up are more what I like to refer to as my squirrel brain, running about and thinking about ALL THE THINGS. It&amp;#39;s not me worrying about horrible things that are going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will be the first to admit I have plenty of lifestyle stress, like I said, four kids, going to college full time, commuting to college, a husband who has actual diagnosed anxiety disorder. But my husband&amp;#39;s dx makes sense, he actually has an undercurrent of worry and doubt and he is prone to it causing big issues in his life (and he has been working on various ways to treat that over the years, is having success and has taken on the main household/kid management stuff while I&amp;#39;m in college). ALL of which I have told my doctor. I would be perfectly willing to admit I have a lifestyle anxiety but calling what I have anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder is taking a molehill and making it a mountain. I don&amp;#39;t have depression, besides feeling a bit down right before my period starts, as I described. I asked why she was bringing up bipolar disorder and she said because of something the counselor said. The counselor said nothing to me and going back through my chart notes online I found no mention of it. So I&amp;#39;ll ask the counselor about it when I see her again but this whole thing felt very odd in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So (I&amp;#39;m really sorry this is so damn long but I thought best to be thorough with you guys to get a read from other women with ADHD) I am not sure why she is suggesting I have anxiety or bipolar disorder instead of ADHD looking at my symptoms. Based on her previous behavior, I am suspecting she is not educated with adult woman presentations of ADHD and is thinking that because I manage my life well enough I don&amp;#39;t have it. I also feel every time I go to my doctor she&amp;#39;s in a rush and doesn&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time asking thorough follow up questions, she doesn&amp;#39;t give me enough time to explain my thoughts without interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did give me an rx of ritalin to try and Clonidine for night in case the ritalin gives me insomnia, and she also suggested I meet with a psychiatrist liason to get a more precise diagnosis and see the counselor again. But she sounded really concerned I didn&amp;#39;t have the right diagnosis, that I may be bipolar, due to my anxiety which all of sudden she thought she should diagnose me with when she has never brought this up before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have a follow up with her in two weeks to discuss how the meds are going and adjust dosing, and another appt with the counselor (love the counselor, trying hard to read the books she rec&amp;#39;d and get tips) and an appt with the psychiatrist liason (I have no idea what to expect there.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked up info on bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. While there&amp;#39;s like a couple things on symptoms list I could say, yeah, sure, that fits, they are things that fit much better with my other things I&amp;#39;m already diagnosed with, the PMDD, hypothyroidism, and now ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had kinda thought about switching docs before this (due to her not really listening well). Taking my kids to their well child exams this year and getting to &amp;#39;try out&amp;#39; other doctors made me think, &amp;quot;maybe I should switch&amp;quot;. But then I wanted to explore the ADHD thing and now I&amp;#39;m working on refining meds for it. I don&amp;#39;t know if me switching docs now is a good idea (and it would take a few months for me to be seen by the new doc, they are super busy in this area and new patient appts book out awhile.) Husbeast says with our insurance we still get to see old pcp while waiting to see new pcp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: PCP doc, who previously always seems rushed and rushes appts, jumping in with stuff before I finish explanations, doubts counselor&amp;#39;s ADHD-PI diagnosis and seems really wanting the problem to be anxiety and/or bipolar disorder, when I feel either of those is a poor fit of symptoms, ADHD fits great for me with what I have read about adult woman presentations of ADHD. PCP doc did give me rx for ritalin/clonadine so things are going forward but I&amp;#39;m still considering switching docs anyway, I just don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s a good idea. Am I just being too stubborn thinking bipolar disorder or anxiety disorder is not a good fit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALSO: if I am shopping for another doctor how do i find one that has experience with adult women presentations of ADHD? I have googled the shit out of this but I live in a small rural town surrounded by smaller rural-er towns and there&amp;#39;s no recs for anything but one psychiatrist, no PCP recs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also I&amp;#39;M SORRY a lot for this long ass post. I am just trying to figure out if this is ridiculous to think she&amp;#39;s trying to reach to avoid the ADHD thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "New diagnosis, ADHD-PI, 33 year old woman, in community college, mom, ENFP personality. The ADHD diagnosis has been a frustrating process because my doctor has been reluctant to see me as ADHD. My sister was diagnosed last year, and I had been surprised because I thought of ADHD as a hyperactive kid thing. I researched it and was surprised to see so much of myself in the descriptions. I thought, well, maybe I have it, but I'm dealing pretty well with it, so no need to seek medical help/meds/etc. Then the end of term came for me and I fell apart at the end of term when I had to sit down and edit videos/create computer animation for three end of term projects. So I made an appointment.\n\nAt the appointment my PCP doctor severely doubted my sisters diagnosis because she did well in school. She doubted my suspicions but gave me a Wellbutrin rx and sent me to be evaluated anyway. I wen to counselor.

I always forgot my homework or forgot to write in my planner on which chapters to read OR write in my planner, but forget my textbook I needed in my locker FOR my homework. If paper assignments were due, I would frantically search my book sack for my paper. Weirdly, I made great grades in highschool and decent grades in college, so I never thought I had ADHD.\nMy mom told me that she was always nervous when I was learning to drive because I spaced out a lot.

I do fear that people will be more critical and judgmental about me having ADHD (on top!) because of the bad stigma and common misunderstanding of the illness all together. Even though the bipolar symptoms are more disabling for me, I fear I will have more trouble communicating and getting understanding about my ADHD.

I do fear that people will be more critical and judgmental about me having ADHD (on top!) because of the bad stigma and common misunderstanding of the illness all together.

But because I needed companionship so much (and the dopamine underfunctioning explains a lot of this) I wound up dating men for three years who were terrible for me in the long run but quelled things in the short run, so out of self-preservation from the stream of narcissists I attracted, I just went cold turkey celibate since apparently my ADD brain was always craving dopamine and overruled my better judgment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last year I finally &amp;quot;worked hard&amp;quot; against my day dreaminess with coffee, meditation, and surfing, and went on the glamor tour of being a food/travel magazine journalist/freelance editor and gallivanted all over the world which somewhat worked with extreme generosity from several friends who housed me here and there when my income would swing wildly (I&amp;#39;m a freelancer so invoicing is always a fingernail to cliff thing for me). I was so stressed out the entire time from handling logistics (my weakest suit), but I had read somewhere the ADHD brain was good in a bind and thrived on rapid fire decision making (I found it very stressful while fun but stressful.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last year the ISIS attacks started with frequency in Europe and I was living there, and everything felt very close, and I went into complete emotional overwhelm during those months. But luckily I met someone while living abroad and having experienced 8+ years of highly stable relationships I was overwhelmed with the happiness of knowing how much my life would improve with having a person to cuddle daily plus stability and security b/c I freak out without it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to present day when my boyfriend has broken up with me (he has his own HFA issues, unfortunately plus family trauma) and I&amp;#39;m back in the dating world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only found out ... yesterday, that all my rushed dating habits are from ADHD -- that I&amp;#39;m trying to get a social scaffolding from other people and that my initial clinginess is about getting my brain to function properly more than a new person being the right person for my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is so scattered and lengthy -- I got a prescription today for meds but due to being underemployed and on poor people&amp;#39;s insurance there might be some hoops to jump through. Anyway, it was the complete malfunction between fascism and hate crimes rising and the break up that put me into such a state of catastrophic emotional overwhelm that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to work on my book (which a publishing house has expressed interest in), and with no hope of my stabilizing relationship happening I&amp;#39;ve finally gone to get diagnosed for meds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, is that I look and sound like a put together person. I&amp;#39;m attractive, went to elite schooling, and have studied enough emotional intelligence geniuses that I can do charming in spades when called upon. I pretty much date the most successful men who exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is that my ADD&amp;#39;ness broke up my most committed relationship (my inability to proofread spreadsheets made a company let me go and I couldn&amp;#39;t stand disappointing my fiance -- that I couldn&amp;#39;t hold together a permanent job), and I&amp;#39;m (ha) rejection sensitive that the men I date expect a put-together person because that&amp;#39;s what I project. My exterior looks very glossy and put together, whereas my insides are a fretful insecure mess because of all the failure I&amp;#39;ve experienced due to my daydreaming/brain fog condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how can I find someone who will love and accept me with all my flawed ADD&amp;#39;ness? Is it because I can&amp;#39;t accept myself that I keep dating men who find women who are less than perfect unacceptable? That got really heavy really fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: I guess the questions is is how did any of you find supportive partners who did not quail at the thought of being with a disorganized, but well meaning partner who also careens into emotional depths and needs help getting out of them? It&amp;#39;s hard to see where the boundary line should be in terms of having a partner who is ok with assisting with EF stuff?

But because I needed companionship so much (and the dopamine underfunctioning explains a lot of this) I wound up dating men for three years who were terrible for me in the long run but quelled things in the short run, so out of self-preservation from the stream of narcissists I attracted, I just went cold turkey celibate since apparently my ADD brain was always craving dopamine and overruled my better judgment. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, last year I finally \"worked hard\" against my day dreaminess with coffee, meditation, and surfing, and went on the glamor tour of being a food/travel magazine journalist/freelance editor and gallivanted all over the world which somewhat worked with extreme generosity from several friends who housed me here and there when my income would swing wildly (I'm a freelancer so invoicing is always a fingernail to cliff thing for me). I was so stressed out the entire time from handling logistics (my weakest suit), but I had read somewhere the ADHD brain was good in a bind and thrived on rapid fire decision making (I found it very stressful while fun but stressful.)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, last year the ISIS attacks started with frequency in Europe and I was living there, and everything felt very close, and I went into complete emotional overwhelm during those months. But luckily I met someone while living abroad and having experienced 8+ years of highly stable relationships I was overwhelmed with the happiness of knowing how much my life would improve with having a person to cuddle daily plus stability and security b/c I freak out without it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to present day when my boyfriend has broken up with me (he has his own HFA issues, unfortunately plus family trauma) and I'm back in the dating world.\n\n\n\n\n\nI only found out ... yesterday, that all my rushed dating habits are from ADHD -- that I'm trying to get a social scaffolding from other people and that my initial clinginess is about getting my brain to function properly more than a new person being the right person for my life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry this is so scattered and lengthy -- I got a prescription today for meds but due to being underemployed and on poor people's insurance there might be some hoops to jump through. Anyway, it was the complete malfunction between fascism and hate crimes rising and the break up that put me into such a state of catastrophic emotional overwhelm that I haven't been able to work on my book (which a publishing house has expressed interest in), and with no hope of my stabilizing relationship happening I've finally gone to get diagnosed for meds.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy question is, is that I look and sound like a put together person. I'm attractive, went to elite schooling, and have studied enough emotional intelligence geniuses that I can do charming in spades when called upon. I pretty much date the most successful men who exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue is that my ADD'ness broke up my most committed relationship (my inability to proofread spreadsheets made a company let me go and I couldn't stand disappointing my fiance -- that I couldn't hold together a permanent job), and I'm (ha) rejection sensitive that the men I date expect a put-together person because that's what I project. My exterior looks very glossy and put together, whereas my insides are a fretful insecure mess because of all the failure I've experienced due to my daydreaming/brain fog condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how can I find someone who will love and accept me with all my flawed ADD'ness? Is it because I can't accept myself that I keep dating men who find women who are less than perfect unacceptable? That got really heavy really fast.\n\n\n\n\nETA: I guess the questions is is how did any of you find supportive partners who did not quail at the thought of being with a disorganized, but well meaning partner who also careens into emotional depths and needs help getting out of them? It's hard to see where the boundary line should be in terms of having a partner who is ok with assisting with EF stuff? My ex-fiance always complained about needing to handle my bills/paperwork etc. and lion's share of the household maintenance/cleaning work.\n\nETA2: Turns out age 38 (which I'm at) according to this https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/academic-success-program-seminars/id431720832 means my estrogen levels are falling which is why my previous coping skills don't work!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5yrubk", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Blinded by the Light of Scales Falling from My Eyes (WRT: Dating/Emotions/ADD), Advice Needed!", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/xd7ESYCJdYP-icl7GLmOXz8YtIC9TVCDI_oENaq3z3g.jpg?s=e97377e8be4167b5a01057819f6c0477", "width": 300, "height": 300}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/xd7ESYCJdYP-icl7GLmOXz8YtIC9TVCDI_oENaq3z3g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=df2b2dbb3af954e3b3064207ed39fdc9", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/xd7ESYCJdYP-icl7GLmOXz8YtIC9TVCDI_oENaq3z3g.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=7d8cb194e9f55fe84f28ee9edf892f57", "width": 216, "height": 216}], "variants": {}, "id": "_ha65JlmAt9hQRuCL9ipLGlc7MlvhdazTEliCccHyJA"}], "enabled": false}, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1489418736.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_5yrubk", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/5yrubk/blinded_by_the_light_of_scales_falling_from_my/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1489251569.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/5yrubk/blinded_by_the_light_of_scales_falling_from_my/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "apocketvenus", "created_utc": 1489222769.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just started medication in late August.

At the same time, I don't want her to think I am jumping to conclusions or going over her. I have already told her about my struggles with paying attention, hyper-focus, anxiety attacks, depression, remembering things and staying organised, finishing tasks etc. I would love some advice on how to approach this situation.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5svd1y", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Being treated for self-esteem issues and not ADHD", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "author_cakeday": true, "edited": 1486586929.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_5svd1y", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/5svd1y/being_treated_for_selfesteem_issues_and_not_adhd/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1486615325.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/5svd1y/being_treated_for_selfesteem_issues_and_not_adhd/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "swatir24", "created_utc": 1486586525.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically what the title says but here is a bit of background:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get period pains from hell to the point that it interferes with my daily life and my ability to do my job and I can&amp;#39;t afford it.

My boyfriend and I were invited to eat lunch at his aunt and grandma&amp;#39;s house for his cousin&amp;#39;s quincea\u00f1era. My boyfriend&amp;#39;s mom warned me to pick nice clothes because his grandma can be judgemental about appearances. So, I spent time very carefully ironing my white chiffon shirt with a lace front panel and pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the luncheon, I sat down, trying my hardest to look presentable, but my ADHD was in full swing. My boyfriend&amp;#39;s grandma&amp;#39;s slightly crazy great aunt started talking out of nowhere to me and I didn&amp;#39;t realize it until my bf&amp;#39;s mom pointed it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat there fidgeting, and playing with my earring without thinking.

There was a salad with bright pink beets, which I hate, chicken and rice. As we were a lot of people, we were eating with plates on our laps whole sitting on the couches and chairs around the room. As I go to eat, I impulsively try to cut my chicken with my fork instead of just picking it up and biting it (no knives) and end up spilling bright pink beet salad all over my nice white chiffon and lace shirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this stains it bright fucking pink. I had to quickly get up, go into the kitchen to set my plate down (where my bf&amp;#39;s grandma saw me with my shirt and directed me to the bathroom). I quickly, on the verge of tears, was rinsing my shirt in the sink when my bf&amp;#39;s mom came in to help. The bright pink beet stain luckily came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was too late; I had been seen by my bf&amp;#39;s grandma and was mortified. All I wanted to do was crawl in a hole. She offered me a spot at a table, but I would&amp;#39;ve eaten by myself like a little kid off in a corner. I wanted to cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse still, remember the earring I was fidgeting with and something I felt had gone down my shirt? I started fidgeting with it again and realized the back was gone. I spent 5 minutes trying to discretely shove my hands down the couch cushions looking for the back fastener before I remembered the feeling in my shirt. So I looked in and there it was, in my bra. So I fished it out when I hoped no one was looking and stuck it back on my earring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flustered and dying inside, we ended up leaving soon after. But instead of going home, we went to the mall. Bf&amp;#39;s mom asked me if I was sleepy and I said yes so it wouldn&amp;#39;t seem like I was just distracted. I wasn&amp;#39;t sleepy at all, just ruminating.

You&amp;#39;re taking the week off because you have an extra week of vacation. Vacation that I don&amp;#39;t begrudge you, but I&amp;#39;m gonna call you a &amp;#39;lucky bastard&amp;#39; anyway, because I don&amp;#39;t have that luxury. This week I have to fly to the west coast and be &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; through at least Friday while at the offices. The mere thought exhausts me and puts me in a bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, I feel like you&amp;#39;re suspicious of me because I am staying in California Friday night and Saturday night, and I haven&amp;#39;t made plans with any of the friends you know I have on the west coast. Fact of the matter is, I want to be a hermit for a bit - to process the events of late that have put me in an exceptionally bad mood, and to see what it feels like to be a &amp;quot;solo traveler&amp;quot; although I&amp;#39;m honestly/earnestly terrified I&amp;#39;ll just sleep all day in my hotel room both days I&amp;#39;m there without you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the problems started this morning. I was at my exit in the city when I suddenly realized I&amp;#39;d bolted out of the house so fast that I forgot to take my Vyvanse (40mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg). As soon as I realized that I started to cry, alone in my car. Not because I was hurt or sad, but because I knew that prepping for my week ahead without my meds was going to be painful, and I would be in a fog all day while I did it. I felt like I had to lift a boulder, knowing I wouldn&amp;#39;t have much strength today. And it was all my fucking fault. I beat myself up for not replenishing my Vyvanse/Wellbutrin stash in my computer bag. I don&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;dare&lt;/strong&gt; keep the meds at work, because I&amp;#39;m scared if someone found them I&amp;#39;d be fired for having a controlled substance (Vyvanse) in a work drawer where others might find it. Not to mention that I don&amp;#39;t really get &amp;quot;extras&amp;quot; of my meds. I get 30 days&amp;#39; worth at a time and get to refill them a whopping 2 days early if I&amp;#39;m lucky. I have to skip days in order to accrue enough for an &amp;quot;emergency stash&amp;quot; when I&amp;#39;m at work in case I leave in a rush and forget, like I did today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dried my eyes before I got to the parking garage. I sat down and made a list when I got into the office. 13 things to do at the office today. I think I&amp;#39;ve done all of them. I say &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; because I lost the list midway through the day. I have no fucking clue where it went. But it suddenly went missing and I had to re-fill in what was missing from the holes of my foggy memory. Boarding pass printed - Check. Mouse and travel power supply for my laptop in my bag - Check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left early and surprised you by being home at 6:15. I could tell I surprised you, because as soon as I raised the door to the garage, while checking the mailbox, you came out for the recycling and garbage bins. I was pissed the instant I saw them by the curb - you had the day off! But I know that you were probably figuring you&amp;#39;d bring them in before I got home around 7. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to plan ahead and pack yesterday, and honestly I got 85% of it done. And I&amp;#39;m proud I did that, especially because an anxiety attack came on yesterday and I breathed my way through it. I reminded myself to start from the bottom up/inside out. This is the way I pack. Pills and vitamins first. Underwear, bra and socks next. Bottom up and inside out. Breathe. Don&amp;#39;t panic. I almost got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there were key things missing that I had to put in today. I took my shower, because my hair takes so long to dry I can&amp;#39;t put it off until o&amp;#39;dark-early in the morning and expect it will happen. I tried to get everything together, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find my charger for my phone and I couldn&amp;#39;t find my eyebrow powder and wax. I searched everywhere. Suddenly, I realized I couldn&amp;#39;t find the toothbrush I&amp;#39;d taken on our last vacation. WHERE THE FUCK DOES ALL THIS SHIT GO WHEN I&amp;#39;M NOT LOOKING?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here I am, post-shower, half naked, running around trying to put everything together and figure out where the hell all this shit went that really, shouldn&amp;#39;t have &amp;quot;gone missing&amp;quot; in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT PRECISELY&lt;/strong&gt; 30 minutes after I came home, I was still running around looking for things. You called out, &amp;quot;When are you coming down?&amp;quot; I broke. &amp;quot;When I FUCKING get finished packing, okay???!!!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You got mad. I don&amp;#39;t blame you. I&amp;#39;m a bitch like this. I hate myself like this. I wish every day I was not temperamental. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We fought over the charger. You brought up the fast charger, even though I just asked you to help me bring up a charger. I took it, not wanting to argue that I didn&amp;#39;t need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here I am, putting you off for another 20 minutes before I come down to &amp;quot;hang out&amp;quot; for the evening. You think it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;m emailing my dad. I lied to you about that. The real reason is that, although I&amp;#39;ve showered, packed my bags and gotten everything to a state where &lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s okay, I&amp;#39;m panicking inside. I need time to breathe. I need space in between my seconds and minutes, and I don&amp;#39;t have them right now. So here I am pounding this beer, that I hid from you when I came into the house, because you&amp;#39;d get upset with me, just hoping that it helps spread out time. I feel I don&amp;#39;t have time. I don&amp;#39;t have space. I&amp;#39;m a little freaked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the big reasons I married you is because you&amp;#39;re a model for the kind of person I wish I could be.

Fact of the matter is, I want to be a hermit for a bit - to process the events of late that have put me in an exceptionally bad mood, and to see what it feels like to be a \"solo traveler\" although I'm honestly/earnestly terrified I'll just sleep all day in my hotel room both days I'm there without you.\n\nAnyway, the problems started this morning. I was at my exit in the city when I suddenly realized I'd bolted out of the house so fast that I forgot to take my Vyvanse (40mg) and Wellbutrin (300mg). As soon as I realized that I started to cry, alone in my car. Not because I was hurt or sad, but because I knew that prepping for my week ahead without my meds was going to be painful, and I would be in a fog all day while I did it. I felt like I had to lift a boulder, knowing I wouldn't have much strength today. And it was all my fucking fault. I beat myself up for not replenishing my Vyvanse/Wellbutrin stash in my computer bag. I don't **dare** keep the meds at work, because I'm scared if someone found them I'd be fired for having a controlled substance (Vyvanse) in a work drawer where others might find it. Not to mention that I don't really get \"extras\" of my meds. I get 30 days' worth at a time and get to refill them a whopping 2 days early if I'm lucky. I have to skip days in order to accrue enough for an \"emergency stash\" when I'm at work in case I leave in a rush and forget, like I did today.\n\nI dried my eyes before I got to the parking garage. I sat down and made a list when I got into the office. 13 things to do at the office today. I think I've done all of them. I say \"think\" because I lost the list midway through the day. I have no fucking clue where it went. But it suddenly went missing and I had to re-fill in what was missing from the holes of my foggy memory. Boarding pass printed - Check. Mouse and travel power supply for my laptop in my bag - Check.\n\nI left early and surprised you by being home at 6:15. I could tell I surprised you, because as soon as I raised the door to the garage, while checking the mailbox, you came out for the recycling and garbage bins. I was pissed the instant I saw them by the curb - you had the day off! But I know that you were probably figuring you'd bring them in before I got home around 7. \n\nI tried to plan ahead and pack yesterday, and honestly I got 85% of it done. And I'm proud I did that, especially because an anxiety attack came on yesterday and I breathed my way through it. I reminded myself to start from the bottom up/inside out. This is the way I pack. Pills and vitamins first. Underwear, bra and socks next. Bottom up and inside out. Breathe. Don't panic. I almost got there.\n\nBut there were key things missing that I had to put in today. I took my shower, because my hair takes so long to dry I can't put it off until o'dark-early in the morning and expect it will happen. I tried to get everything together, but I couldn't find my charger for my phone and I couldn't find my eyebrow powder and wax. I searched everywhere. Suddenly, I realized I couldn't find the toothbrush I'd taken on our last vacation. WHERE THE FUCK DOES ALL THIS SHIT GO WHEN I'M NOT LOOKING?\n\nHere I am, post-shower, half naked, running around trying to put everything together and figure out where the hell all this shit went that really, shouldn't have \"gone missing\" in the first place.\n\n**AT PRECISELY** 30 minutes after I came home, I was still running around looking for things. You called out, \"When are you coming down?\" I broke. \"When I FUCKING get finished packing, okay???!!!\" \n\nYou got mad. I don't blame you. I'm a bitch like this. I hate myself like this. I wish every day I was not temperamental. \n\nWe fought over the charger. You brought up the fast charger, even though I just asked you to help me bring up a charger. I took it, not wanting to argue that I didn't need it.\n\nNow here I am, putting you off for another 20 minutes before I come down to \"hang out\" for the evening. You think it's because I'm emailing my dad. I lied to you about that. The real reason is that, although I've showered, packed my bags and gotten everything to a state where *I think* it's okay, I'm panicking inside. I need time to breathe. I need space in between my seconds and minutes, and I don't have them right now. So here I am pounding this beer, that I hid from you when I came into the house, because you'd get upset with me, just hoping that it helps spread out time. I feel I don't have time. I don't have space. I'm a little freaked out.\n\nOne of the big reasons I married you is because you're a model for the kind of person I wish I could be. I wish I could be that person right now. I'm sorry I'm not. But I don't know how to explain you why I'm not. \n\nLove, \nMe", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5czfkj", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "To My Neurotypical Husband - From your ADHD, Depressed, Introverted and Anxiety-Riddled Wife", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 40, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_5czfkj", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/5czfkj/to_my_neurotypical_husband_from_your_adhd/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1479197702.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/5czfkj/to_my_neurotypical_husband_from_your_adhd/", "author_flair_text": "Fabulous Fillion GIF Fairy - Ooh Shiny!", "quarantine": false, "author": "speedycat2014", "created_utc": 1479168902.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!

Hopefully some one here can relate)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brain is spinning tonight and I honestly just need to vent somewhere to somebody so I guess it&amp;#39;s going to be you guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little background: I just received my official adult diagnosed with ADHD combined type-severe, along with severe social anxiety about 2 months ago. Not receiving treatment at this time. It took me over a month to actually get the diagnosis from first appointment on. I was actually originally diagnosed when I was 4 and had the typical struggles of a girl with extreme social awkwardness and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast work today: I&amp;#39;m a single working mother to two girls (2 an 4) and I feel like my life is falling apart. Although to be fair that&amp;#39;s a pretty common occurrence. It seems like I can only ever keep one thing in order at a time, right now it&amp;#39;s my job. It&amp;#39;s the only thing I can seem to be on time for and keep up appearances. My bank account is an absolute mess from impulse shopping. My laundry is all over the place The second I get everything clean it&amp;#39;s like I turn around and there are clothes all over my house again. No matter how hard I try the most I can ever get his half of the clean laundry in two dressers. On the opposite end some days I&amp;#39;ve gotten so busy and Hyper focused on cleaning that I forgot to give my kids meals until 2-3 hours after their usual meal times. I can&amp;#39;t seem to keep an appointment to save my life, even for my kids. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s getting started late, others it&amp;#39;s kids aren&amp;#39;t cooperating or I can&amp;#39;t find shoes, keys, diaper bag etc.. and I just give up! Too anxious to face thee inevitable annoyed looks when I&amp;#39;m late. The other half of the time I just completely forget I even have the appointment set up. Then I spend the next two days wallowing in guilt and self-pity because I can&amp;#39;t even remember a stupid appointment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t matter so much if it was just me. Honestly I used to like being a little bit crazy, it was just part of who I was late disorganized clumsy. My friends accepted it, and for the most part I was happy.

Hopefully some one here can relate)\n\nMy brain is spinning tonight and I honestly just need to vent somewhere to somebody so I guess it's going to be you guys.\n\nLittle background: I just received my official adult diagnosed with ADHD combined type-severe, along with severe social anxiety about 2 months ago. Not receiving treatment at this time. It took me over a month to actually get the diagnosis from first appointment on. I was actually originally diagnosed when I was 4 and had the typical struggles of a girl with extreme social awkwardness and ADHD.\n\n Fast work today: I'm a single working mother to two girls (2 an 4) and I feel like my life is falling apart. Although to be fair that's a pretty common occurrence. It seems like I can only ever keep one thing in order at a time, right now it's my job. It's the only thing I can seem to be on time for and keep up appearances. My bank account is an absolute mess from impulse shopping. My laundry is all over the place The second I get everything clean it's like I turn around and there are clothes all over my house again. No matter how hard I try the most I can ever get his half of the clean laundry in two dressers. On the opposite end some days I've gotten so busy and Hyper focused on cleaning that I forgot to give my kids meals until 2-3 hours after their usual meal times. I can't seem to keep an appointment to save my life, even for my kids. Sometimes it's getting started late, others it's kids aren't cooperating or I can't find shoes, keys, diaper bag etc.. and I just give up! Too anxious to face thee inevitable annoyed looks when I'm late. The other half of the time I just completely forget I even have the appointment set up. Then I spend the next two days wallowing in guilt and self-pity because I can't even remember a stupid appointment. \n\nIt wouldn't matter so much if it was just me. Honestly I used to like being a little bit crazy, it was just part of who I was late disorganized clumsy. My friends accepted it, and for the most part I was happy. But ever since I had my kids especially since her dad and I split I feel the pressure to be a good mom. To create a life for them that I never had. Give them the skills to be independent put together that's successful adults. I don't know how to do that when I can't even remember to sign my daughter up for preschool. Or make sure that they brush their teeth every morning. For the love of God half the time I leave the house without brushing my own hair.

Every mention of casually discarding pills makes me cringe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I began to take adderall, I felt &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; like myself. My dosage only increased once, when I was getting used to the drug, and it&amp;#39;s been seven years. You don&amp;#39;t need to keep increasing unless you are chasing a high. (There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with upping when it&amp;#39;s a legitimate need, but that time frame is usually years, not months or weeks.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drug addiction is an issue.

Once, while living in New Hampshire, I skipped a day of work to drive three hours each way to the health clinic where my prescription was still on file. Never was I more resourceful or unswerving than when I was devising ways to secure more Adderall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will really help all of the people with ADHD who have a hell of a time getting their medication properly because it is so strictly regulated and WE HAVE ADHD. Let&amp;#39;s trivialize the fact that some people HAVE to miss work and schlep for hours. I&amp;#39;m lucky to have be able to fill a new prescriptions a few days early (combination of insurance, pharmacy, and state laws) but it was hell when that wasn&amp;#39;t possible (love you, CVS). And I know there are others out there who don&amp;#39;t have an option. &lt;strong&gt;And fuck you for stealing someone&amp;#39;s medication, especially when they can&amp;#39;t just get an early refill to make up for your shittiness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, according to a review published in 2012 in the journal Brain and Behavior, the off-label use of prescription stimulants had come to represent the second-most-common form of illicit drug use in college by 2004. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;That is not what off-label means.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are living out what it might mean, both psychologically and neurologically, to take a powerful drug &lt;strong&gt;we do not need&lt;/strong&gt; over long stretches of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No that&amp;#39;s you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I didn\u2019t know then, what I couldn\u2019t have known, was that the question of whether Adderall actually improves cognitive performance when taken off-label \u2014 whether or not it is a \u201csmart drug\u201d \u2014 was unresolved. It would be another few years before studies appeared showing that Adderall\u2019s effect on cognitive enhancement is more than a little ambiguous... Ultimately, she says, it is possible that \u201clower-performing people actually do improve on the drug, and higher-performing people show no improvement or actually get worse.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breaking news! Medication may not work if you do not have a condition to treat. People who need a drug benefit from it! (&amp;quot;Lower-performing&amp;quot; is a cute term for &amp;quot;people with learning disabilities&amp;quot;) And again: that&amp;#39;s not what off-label means. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[Blah blah blah I lied to a doctor] Untrue, all of it. I was a focused student and a terrible waitress.

Every mention of casually discarding pills makes me cringe. \n\nWhen I began to take adderall, I felt *more* like myself. My dosage only increased once, when I was getting used to the drug, and it's been seven years. You don't need to keep increasing unless you are chasing a high. (There's nothing wrong with upping when it's a legitimate need, but that time frame is usually years, not months or weeks.) \n\nDrug addiction is an issue. Can we please stop tying it to ADHD and its legitimate treatment? (See also: chronic pain) \n\nI feel especially betrayed because the author is a woman, which is part of the reason I post here. \n\nAlso she uses \"A.D.H.D.\" instead of \"ADHD\" and for some reason that really bugs me. \n\nI'm hesitant to link because I don't want to encourage this nonsense but [here's an archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20161012090300/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/magazine/generation-adderall-addiction.html). \n\nNow on to the ranting: \n\n&gt; I would open other people\u2019s medicine cabinets, root through trash cans where I had previously disposed of pills, write friends\u2019 college essays for barter. Once, while living in New Hampshire, I skipped a day of work to drive three hours each way to the health clinic where my prescription was still on file. Never was I more resourceful or unswerving than when I was devising ways to secure more Adderall.\n\nThis will really help all of the people with ADHD who have a hell of a time getting their medication properly because it is so strictly regulated and WE HAVE ADHD. Let's trivialize the fact that some people HAVE to miss work and schlep for hours. I'm lucky to have be able to fill a new prescriptions a few days early (combination of insurance, pharmacy, and state laws) but it was hell when that wasn't possible (love you, CVS). And I know there are others out there who don't have an option. **And fuck you for stealing someone's medication, especially when they can't just get an early refill to make up for your shittiness.**\n\n&gt; In fact, according to a review published in 2012 in the journal Brain and Behavior, the off-label use of prescription stimulants had come to represent the second-most-common form of illicit drug use in college by 2004. \n\n# That is not what off-label means. \n\n&gt; We are living out what it might mean, both psychologically and neurologically, to take a powerful drug **we do not need** over long stretches of time. \n\nNo that's you. \n\n&gt; What I didn\u2019t know then, what I couldn\u2019t have known, was that the question of whether Adderall actually improves cognitive performance when taken off-label \u2014 whether or not it is a \u201csmart drug\u201d \u2014 was unresolved. It would be another few years before studies appeared showing that Adderall\u2019s effect on cognitive enhancement is more than a little ambiguous... Ultimately, she says, it is possible that \u201clower-performing people actually do improve on the drug, and higher-performing people show no improvement or actually get worse.\u201d \n\nBreaking news! Medication may not work if you do not have a condition to treat. People who need a drug benefit from it! (\"Lower-performing\" is a cute term for \"people with learning disabilities\") And again: that's not what off-label means. \n\n&gt; [Blah blah blah I lied to a doctor] Untrue, all of it. I was a focused student and a terrible waitress. And yet these were the answers that I discovered from the briefest online research were characteristic of the A.D.H.D. diagnostic criteria ***[OP NOTE: SYMPTOMS]***.

(I have always felt like I&amp;#39;m hiding my deficiencies, and hoping I&amp;#39;ve done enough good to not be fired on the spot &lt;strong&gt;for taking too long&lt;/strong&gt; and not completing enough tasks day-in and day-out.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way around the career path I have imagined and laid out here?

If you think there is no other way, then how did YOU get through that &lt;strong&gt;stage in your career&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What career paths are open to someone like me? Someone with ADHD(-PI)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background: I took a reading comprehension-type test in an informal setting in H.S. and the lady said I didn&amp;#39;t have ADHD... I guess I was able to focus enough to not show a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My past 5 therapists haven&amp;#39;t recommended a test, even when I bring up my constant struggles with focus and attention!

I want to get back into the work world, but am finding the same old struggles barring me at the door.\n\nI lose focus writing my **resume**; blank out, then find myself needing to take care of all the other things that con-currently need doing... Or looking up whatever on the Internet that is more interesting than sitting there.\n\nIf able to work, then I find myself getting wrapped up in the details; getting **perfectionistic** and taking too much time on **one aspect** of the project.\n\n(Sidenote: How do you get over **perfectionism** as a **coping strategy** for otherwise not being able to focus on doing a project; doing a 'basic job' on a project?)\n\nBefore I know it, my allotted time to work is over, and I am at exactly Square Zero. Feeling completely ineffectual and hopeless, day after day.\n\nHow am I going to get into my field of interest (arts non-profit work), when all the jobs I am qualified for are **9-to-5 organizational roles**?... I don't want to just fail because I suck at that kind of thing... plus the extremely taxing (for me) housework, and organizing my toddler's life, and **keeping on schedule** that I will still need to keep managing! That stuff takes me **double or more the amt of time it takes my SO or anyone else I know to complete/ accomplish**.\n\nAnd how could I do a more **plugged-in** executive type role when I can't organize and complete **basic tasks**, and also need practice in the work world, period, to get how to get shit done in business?\n\nI want to work, because I hate being home all the time (even though I love my son immensely!), and I want to do something big and exciting, and meaningful to me... I can't see myself succeeding at anything else w/o massive amounts of medicating.\n\nWho will forgive me my **forgetfulness**? How will I keep focused w/o the **rush** of doing things at **the deadline**?\n\nEveryone says \"play up your strengths\" but I have no experience with this, since my weaknesses have usually been basic requirements at any job I've had. (I have always felt like I'm hiding my deficiencies, and hoping I've done enough good to not be fired on the spot **for taking too long** and not completing enough tasks day-in and day-out.)\n\nIs there a way around the career path I have imagined and laid out here? Some path that would be more ideal for someone with my weaknesses? Do I have to start as a **9-to-5 organizational role**? Any creative suggestions? If you think there is no other way, then how did YOU get through that **stage in your career**?\n\nWhat career paths are open to someone like me? Someone with ADHD(-PI)?\n\nBackground: I took a reading comprehension-type test in an informal setting in H.S. and the lady said I didn't have ADHD... I guess I was able to focus enough to not show a problem.\n\nMy past 5 therapists haven't recommended a test, even when I bring up my constant struggles with focus and attention! I think that they chalk it up to the depression I've struggled with since my college years (when the failures started racking up).\n\nI did all A's in H.S. by working for literally **double the school day** after school on homework and projects, trying to stay focused while reading and re-reading passages.

I'm...a little afraid of telling him yet. When I brought up my self-analysis with him, he brushed me off a little (though, it was rather late at the time). I'm a bit afraid of being brushed off again...does anyone figure I should tell him now about what I feel is a bit dubious, yet official, diagnosis? Or should I try to obtain as much legitimacy as possible before bringing it up again? Should I at all (lol probably undoubtedly, but)?

At that age, my life had fallen apart, I couldn&amp;#39;t keep a job, a schedule, or finish college after 8 years trying. I&amp;#39;d been medicated with only moderate improvement with antidepressants for a few years before I started Adderall XR 40mg. Since then, I&amp;#39;ve mostly gotten my shit together, finally felt safe enough driving to get my license at age 30, and got married to another ADHDer almost 3 years ago. We finish eachother&amp;#39;s sentences....the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In April we moved 2 hours away from my PCP, therapist, and gynecologist so we could afford to get a place big enough to start a family. The move happened fast &amp;amp; it was mostly on me to arrange everything, so doing a lot of research on available doctors didn&amp;#39;t happen. There ended up being a psychiatrist&amp;#39;s office w/ a few therapists &amp;amp; 1 prescriber very close to the new place, so I went with it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At my first appointment (2 months ago) I told the psychiatrist that we had just moved &amp;amp; I stopped birth control a couple weeks earlier. He immediately said that I HAD to stop taking my Wellbutrin &amp;amp; Adderall right away, that one could not even consider taking these during pregnancy. I was taken aback by this - I have read A LOT about this &amp;amp; never saw anything (scientific) that was willing to be this unequivocal.  There is growing concern about SSRIs during pregnancy &amp;amp; future psychiatric illness &amp;amp; learning disorders in children, but good studies with clearly negative results are sparse (Yes, I know, Wellbutrin is an NDRI, not an SSRI, but studies on newer drugs are even harder to find). I have never seen a study that focused solely on women taking amphetamine salts/ methylphenidate/ or other ADHD drugs and NOT on the children of methamphetamine addicts. The Dr. couldn&amp;#39;t come up with anything stronger than &amp;quot;the data isn&amp;#39;t there to show that they are safe, so you can&amp;#39;t take them.&amp;quot;  Keep in mind, he just met me. He doesn&amp;#39;t know what these medications have done for me, and didn&amp;#39;t ask.  He gave me a website to look at for some (more) research &amp;amp; wrote my scripts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went into this appointment planning to stop the Wellbutrin (since I&amp;#39;m quite sure my depressive symptoms had been driven by untreated ADHD) and looking for advice on the Adderall. Sure, I had pretty much decided that I would need to continue the Adderall or some other medication at some level, so I was really looking for thoughts on alternatives or dose changes or something like that. I also expect to consult my new ob/gyn once my appointment rolls around in July.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just got home from my second appointment with this Dr. I told him I had stopped the Wellbutrin after the last appointment but after 2 weeks without the Adderall I couldn&amp;#39;t cope with setting up a new home without it. He repeated that I couldn&amp;#39;t take Adderall &amp;amp; be pregnant, I had to choose one or the other. He never offered any alternative treatments. I said I couldn&amp;#39;t do it, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able take care of myself (like I couldn&amp;#39;t before) without some treatment, so I sure couldn&amp;#39;t take care of a pregnancy, a child, and prepare my home for that child as well. (I wasn&amp;#39;t nearly that succinct or clear because I was so upset with his lack of compassion. I did manage to tell him that the website he sent me to did not back up his position!) So he said he couldn&amp;#39;t treat me, but agreed to write a 1 month script while I look for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, can anyone point me to any studies looking at women who took ADHD meds of any kind during pregnancy? I don&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of respect for reasearchers that equate therapeutic doses of amphetamine salts with the MUCH higher doses a methamphetamine user takes. Don&amp;#39;t get me started on studies that feed animals doses 100x higher than any human takes. Even so, the claimed negative consequences are so hard to quantify, this is not thalidomide or Zika.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, any ladies out there taken any ADHD meds during their pregnancies? Yeah, I don&amp;#39;t really want to invite &amp;quot;oh my god, don&amp;#39;t you dare breed! How dare you take such a risk with your baby&amp;#39;s life, you selfish piece of shit!&amp;quot; type comments, but if you can back it up with some science I&amp;#39;m not aware of, then let me hear it. Let&amp;#39;s be honest, with 2 ADHD parents &amp;amp; 2 ADHD grandmothers, our kid will DEFINITELY have ADHD no matter what I do. As long as I&amp;#39;m not making my kid microcephalic or limbless, it seems worth the risk to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, any recommendations on getting a new doc, a new therapist, or a new ob/gyn for that matter (in case the one I&amp;#39;m seeing in a month sucks) in the Springfield, MA area?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how long it might take us to concieve, I&amp;#39;m on cycle 3 of trying, I&amp;#39;ll know in 2 weeks if it&amp;#39;s on to round 4. The thought of going off meds completely for some unknown amount of time (1 year? 2?) + 9 months + at least 6 months of breastfeeding scares the shit out of me. What about screwing over myself for a few years, possibly ruining my marriage, only to find out it&amp;#39;s not going to work for us anyways, for unrelated reasons? It feels sooo insane to take THAT risk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has always been about weighing risks &amp;amp; benefits.  I felt like the psychiatrist didn&amp;#39;t give a fuck about the benefits to me (his patient) of taking this medication or the risks to me (his patient) of refusing to treat me, he only saw the percieved (unproven) risks to my as-yet-nonexistant baby (nevermind the risks to my child if mom can&amp;#39;t stay on top of making/going to her prenatal doctors&amp;#39; appointments).  I suddenly became nothing more than a baby incubator to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my rant!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm 33, ADHD-PI, not diagnosed/treated/taken seriously when I asked about ADHD until I was 28.

We finish eachother's sentences....the next day.\n\nIn April we moved 2 hours away from my PCP, therapist, and gynecologist so we could afford to get a place big enough to start a family. The move happened fast &amp; it was mostly on me to arrange everything, so doing a lot of research on available doctors didn't happen. There ended up being a psychiatrist's office w/ a few therapists &amp; 1 prescriber very close to the new place, so I went with it.  \n\nAt my first appointment (2 months ago) I told the psychiatrist that we had just moved &amp; I stopped birth control a couple weeks earlier. He immediately said that I HAD to stop taking my Wellbutrin &amp; Adderall right away, that one could not even consider taking these during pregnancy. I was taken aback by this - I have read A LOT about this &amp; never saw anything (scientific) that was willing to be this unequivocal.  There is growing concern about SSRIs during pregnancy &amp; future psychiatric illness &amp; learning disorders in children, but good studies with clearly negative results are sparse (Yes, I know, Wellbutrin is an NDRI, not an SSRI, but studies on newer drugs are even harder to find). I have never seen a study that focused solely on women taking amphetamine salts/ methylphenidate/ or other ADHD drugs and NOT on the children of methamphetamine addicts. The Dr. couldn't come up with anything stronger than \"the data isn't there to show that they are safe, so you can't take them.\"  Keep in mind, he just met me. He doesn't know what these medications have done for me, and didn't ask.  He gave me a website to look at for some (more) research &amp; wrote my scripts.\n\nI went into this appointment planning to stop the Wellbutrin (since I'm quite sure my depressive symptoms had been driven by untreated ADHD) and looking for advice on the Adderall. Sure, I had pretty much decided that I would need to continue the Adderall or some other medication at some level, so I was really looking for thoughts on alternatives or dose changes or something like that. I also expect to consult my new ob/gyn once my appointment rolls around in July.\n\nSo I just got home from my second appointment with this Dr. I told him I had stopped the Wellbutrin after the last appointment but after 2 weeks without the Adderall I couldn't cope with setting up a new home without it. He repeated that I couldn't take Adderall &amp; be pregnant, I had to choose one or the other. He never offered any alternative treatments. I said I couldn't do it, I wouldn't be able take care of myself (like I couldn't before) without some treatment, so I sure couldn't take care of a pregnancy, a child, and prepare my home for that child as well. (I wasn't nearly that succinct or clear because I was so upset with his lack of compassion. I did manage to tell him that the website he sent me to did not back up his position!) So he said he couldn't treat me, but agreed to write a 1 month script while I look for someone else.\n\nFirst, can anyone point me to any studies looking at women who took ADHD meds of any kind during pregnancy? I don't have a whole lot of respect for reasearchers that equate therapeutic doses of amphetamine salts with the MUCH higher doses a methamphetamine user takes. Don't get me started on studies that feed animals doses 100x higher than any human takes. Even so, the claimed negative consequences are so hard to quantify, this is not thalidomide or Zika.\n\nSecond, any ladies out there taken any ADHD meds during their pregnancies? Yeah, I don't really want to invite \"oh my god, don't you dare breed! How dare you take such a risk with your baby's life, you selfish piece of shit!\" type comments, but if you can back it up with some science I'm not aware of, then let me hear it. Let's be honest, with 2 ADHD parents &amp; 2 ADHD grandmothers, our kid will DEFINITELY have ADHD no matter what I do. As long as I'm not making my kid microcephalic or limbless, it seems worth the risk to me. \n\nThird, any recommendations on getting a new doc, a new therapist, or a new ob/gyn for that matter (in case the one I'm seeing in a month sucks) in the Springfield, MA area?\n\nI don't know how long it might take us to concieve, I'm on cycle 3 of trying, I'll know in 2 weeks if it's on to round 4. The thought of going off meds completely for some unknown amount of time (1 year? 2?) + 9 months + at least 6 months of breastfeeding scares the shit out of me. What about screwing over myself for a few years, possibly ruining my marriage, only to find out it's not going to work for us anyways, for unrelated reasons? It feels sooo insane to take THAT risk. \n\nThis has always been about weighing risks &amp; benefits.  I felt like the psychiatrist didn't give a fuck about the benefits to me (his patient) of taking this medication or the risks to me (his patient) of refusing to treat me, he only saw the percieved (unproven) risks to my as-yet-nonexistant baby (nevermind the risks to my child if mom can't stay on top of making/going to her prenatal doctors' appointments).  I suddenly became nothing more than a baby incubator to him.\n\nThanks for reading my rant!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "4qiz27", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Adderall &amp; pregnancy &amp; my (sexist?) new psychiatrist", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 36, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_4qiz27", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/4qiz27/adderall_pregnancy_my_sexist_new_psychiatrist/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1467276519.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/4qiz27/adderall_pregnancy_my_sexist_new_psychiatrist/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "CarpentryDilettante", "created_utc": 1467247719.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to vent.

Like because I&amp;#39;m a woman, I should instinctively be more inclined towards cleanliness, timeliness, being &amp;quot;gathered&amp;quot;, and that my hyperactivity should be more for general chattiness and never be blunt interruptions or frankness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me addressing my symptoms as an adult has been: creating a schedule, diligently documenting plans (using my phone calendar and setting multiple reminders), and recognizing/reorganizing my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I carry a notebook in my purse now; I try to scribble down intrusive thoughts and sudden ideas, so I can stay on task (but take note).

I would like to have a few big ideas, and a few small tasks, that I can look to (to stay on track and sort of root myself in).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My SO is much more relaxed; he is very diligent and organized by nature, so for him it&amp;#39;s a destressing thing to be able to &amp;quot;go with the flow&amp;quot;.

Like because I'm a woman, I should instinctively be more inclined towards cleanliness, timeliness, being \"gathered\", and that my hyperactivity should be more for general chattiness and never be blunt interruptions or frankness.  \n\nPart of me addressing my symptoms as an adult has been: creating a schedule, diligently documenting plans (using my phone calendar and setting multiple reminders), and recognizing/reorganizing my daily routine.\n\nI carry a notebook in my purse now; I try to scribble down intrusive thoughts and sudden ideas, so I can stay on task (but take note).  I struggle a lot with anxiety, so I'm hoping to create a safe and balanced space (mentally and physically) by doing this.\n\nSo when I carefully plan a 2 day weekend timeslot for my partner, I want to *at least* be able to step into it knowing a few things.  Will we be in town? What time do I need to be ready, and where do I need to meet? I would like to have a few big ideas, and a few small tasks, that I can look to (to stay on track and sort of root myself in).\n\nMy SO is much more relaxed; he is very diligent and organized by nature, so for him it's a destressing thing to be able to \"go with the flow\". He doesn't mind time being more liquid when he has it off; he doesn't mind just \"letting it go\".\n\nBUT that's my whole *problem*; I have no sense of time! I have no organization! I'm not suddenly more orderly because I'm asking when to meet, what we're doing. I'm not afraid of the lack of control, it's that I'm already starting at *no* control, highs tressed because there are *so many possibilities of what to do* that I end up paralyzed/procrastinating and then I am just sort of...wallowing in free time, instead of enjoying it or using it the way I wanted.\n\nIt's so hard to explain this.  It's not like I can stick to my plans or schedules rigidly all the time,but having a framework for my day and tasks helps me, a lot. \n\nIt also stresses me out a ton when I've been asking (\"when? Where? What?\") and, without answering any of those, there is a sudden time constraint such as \"Oh, ____ wants to hang out too\" \n\n\"Oh, but...I thought we were going out of town?\" It's like pulling a block from a tower, and I see the whole idea of what I'd need to prep for tumbling down as he follows up with \"Well I figure we can try to fit it in, no pressure, we'll work it out.

Which I will as soon as I get myself to the library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I do recognize a lot of ADHD traits in myself but I am unsure if they are sever enough to count. For instance, I pay my bills 1-5 days late almost every time. It is late, but not late enough to land me in trouble. I have hard time keeping my apartment clean, but it isn&amp;#39;t a disaster. Just untidy and a bit unorganized. I do get my studying done, but I need to stick to a rather strict routine and use lots of various methods (color coding, studying in a library, make notes..) - just reading does not work. I used to be late to everything but I have become much better at it now and rarely run late (being late makes me super stressed). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My main problem is with inner restlessness or anxiety. I don&amp;#39;t know which. Its not as bad as real anxiety feels. BUT... I have this nagging feeling that I should &amp;quot;do something/go somewhere&amp;quot;. I have lots of ideas about what I want to do to the point that I do none because I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I also jump a bit from task to task (say, write a bit on lab report no 1, go over to the essay, then read a bit, go get tea, back to lab report no 1, send texts, check email, plan next week, read a bit etc), unless my schedule is full and super busy - then I can function normally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another big problem is that I kind of get.. bursts of motivation directed at one certain thing. For instance, I may have put off going to the doctor for months and months. Until one day, when I feel it has to be now. And then that&amp;#39;s almost all I can think about until its done. If the office is closed, I feel stressed and anxious for having to wait for the next day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On medication (which I recently started) I feel like my vision/perception shrinks. I can stick to one task for 2-4h without any bigger distractions than going to the bath room, texting or checking email once or twice. I am less tired at the end of the day but do fall asleep easily. At the same time I feel a bit sleepy, but also more energetic although at the same time less bubbly/chirpy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But.. I don&amp;#39;t know if I really do match the label, because people around me don&amp;#39;t seem to find me inattentive or particularly hyper (granted I do doodle/play candy crush or crochet when spending time with people - unless the discussion is super engaging). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d just like to hear how stuff is for you, if you were diagnosed as an adult but don&amp;#39;t have any super sever troubles in every day life. I worry I might be one of the over-diagnosed people (something I have a dialog with my dr and psychologist). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I was currently diagnosed.

For instance, I pay my bills 1-5 days late almost every time. It is late, but not late enough to land me in trouble. I have hard time keeping my apartment clean, but it isn't a disaster. Just untidy and a bit unorganized. I do get my studying done, but I need to stick to a rather strict routine and use lots of various methods (color coding, studying in a library, make notes..) - just reading does not work. I used to be late to everything but I have become much better at it now and rarely run late (being late makes me super stressed). \n\nMy main problem is with inner restlessness or anxiety. I don't know which. Its not as bad as real anxiety feels. BUT... I have this nagging feeling that I should \"do something/go somewhere\". I have lots of ideas about what I want to do to the point that I do none because I don't know what to do. I also jump a bit from task to task (say, write a bit on lab report no 1, go over to the essay, then read a bit, go get tea, back to lab report no 1, send texts, check email, plan next week, read a bit etc), unless my schedule is full and super busy - then I can function normally. \n\nAnother big problem is that I kind of get.. bursts of motivation directed at one certain thing. For instance, I may have put off going to the doctor for months and months. Until one day, when I feel it has to be now. And then that's almost all I can think about until its done. If the office is closed, I feel stressed and anxious for having to wait for the next day. \n\nOn medication (which I recently started) I feel like my vision/perception shrinks. I can stick to one task for 2-4h without any bigger distractions than going to the bath room, texting or checking email once or twice. I am less tired at the end of the day but do fall asleep easily. At the same time I feel a bit sleepy, but also more energetic although at the same time less bubbly/chirpy. \n\nBut.. I don't know if I really do match the label, because people around me don't seem to find me inattentive or particularly hyper (granted I do doodle/play candy crush or crochet when spending time with people - unless the discussion is super engaging). \n\nI'd just like to hear how stuff is for you, if you were diagnosed as an adult but don't have any super sever troubles in every day life. I worry I might be one of the over-diagnosed people (something I have a dialog with my dr and psychologist).

I was getting my kid dinner and decided to make myself available for a business call as it was probably going to be pretty brief, exchanged a couple of emails about it. The next time it even entered my mind was late that night after my child was asleep and it occurred to me to check my email again and I saw I had a Skype voicemail about it. Mind you I have a smartphone, I didn&amp;#39;t need to make any effort to check mail - just remember to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like... I can sort of handle the forgetting of keys every time I need them, the doing ten tasks at the same time and not finishing any of them properly, being unable to access my mind when asked a question I know the answer to, and allowing myself to unwind and zone out with internet or xbox mind chewing gum - at least I have some level of productivity going on and can just about bear my life. But dropping the ball on a work call and not giving it a second thought is like, dangerous territory IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve seriously considered the idea of meds. I&amp;#39;m generally inclined not to dabble in any medication whatsoever as even over the counter stuff doesn&amp;#39;t do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do to me, I need extra doses of anaesthetic etc. And while I&amp;#39;m interested in informed experimentation with mind expanding chemicals, the idea of constantly dosing your brain with something seems dangerous to me (especially in light of my weird reactions/sensitivity). So the idea of meds is SCARY for me. Most especially the risk of affecting sex drive - my healthy sex drive seems intrinsic to my being and gives me so much joy and human connection and I don&amp;#39;t want to sacrifice it to be a functioning adult because what kind of life would that be!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess I&amp;#39;m looking for anecdotal evidence about how meds have affected your sex lives, if it&amp;#39;s bad how you&amp;#39;ve coped, if it has been fine... or any magical tips you have for not doing what I did yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello ladies.

Mind you I have a smartphone, I didn't need to make any effort to check mail - just remember to.\n\nLike... I can sort of handle the forgetting of keys every time I need them, the doing ten tasks at the same time and not finishing any of them properly, being unable to access my mind when asked a question I know the answer to, and allowing myself to unwind and zone out with internet or xbox mind chewing gum - at least I have some level of productivity going on and can just about bear my life. But dropping the ball on a work call and not giving it a second thought is like, dangerous territory IMHO.\n\nSo this is the first time I've seriously considered the idea of meds. I'm generally inclined not to dabble in any medication whatsoever as even over the counter stuff doesn't do what it's supposed to do to me, I need extra doses of anaesthetic etc. And while I'm interested in informed experimentation with mind expanding chemicals, the idea of constantly dosing your brain with something seems dangerous to me (especially in light of my weird reactions/sensitivity). So the idea of meds is SCARY for me. Most especially the risk of affecting sex drive - my healthy sex drive seems intrinsic to my being and gives me so much joy and human connection and I don't want to sacrifice it to be a functioning adult because what kind of life would that be!?\n\nSo I guess I'm looking for anecdotal evidence about how meds have affected your sex lives, if it's bad how you've coped, if it has been fine... or any magical tips you have for not doing what I did yesterday.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "40rlg9", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Meds and side effects", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_40rlg9", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/40rlg9/meds_and_side_effects/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1452712279.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/40rlg9/meds_and_side_effects/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "vitreouscannon", "created_utc": 1452683479.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My blood pressure which was high off meds and then very high on meds is now apparently perfect.

Well, I&amp;#39;m here for an update for anyone who was in the same situation I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a psychiatrist.  We talked, she agreed that I should start on meds.

Not only does it require me to carry my meds around with me at work (not great at remembering that!), but it&amp;#39;s a bit of a roller coaster.  I didn&amp;#39;t like that super-focused to not-so-much feeling.  So, I went on the extended release (Concerta.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns our that the &amp;quot;generic&amp;quot; Concerta was actually reclassified by the FDA and is its own brand! Well, despite the fact that it was working (56mg XR) I couldn&amp;#39;t pay $50/month for it.  So, my doctor switched me to dexmenthylfenidate (Focalin).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Concerta worked! But I had to switch.  The Focalin is in the same family, so it works as well (and doesn&amp;#39;t cost me a million dollars.)

It&amp;#39;s worth the time and effort. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remember! It&amp;#39;s not all about meds.  I&amp;#39;ve learned how to write things down and schedule, stop procrastinating so much, getting on a consistent sleep schedule, etc.   Changing habits is really part of moving forward, but my meds have impacted me positively in creating positive habits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello, ladies!

When I talk to people, I'm able to focus on the conversation instead of going on a million tangents in my brain.  I'm able to get things done at work without losing interest in minutes.  \n\nMedication has changed my life.  I have accomplished so many things I couldn't before.  Anyone out there who is struggling with these issues, don't be afraid to find help! You don't have to lose your keys/phone/important stuff constantly (and have TWO extra copies just in case, at least for the keys.) You don't have to feel extremely anxious and overwhelmed about the work you've put off/forgotten about.  You don't have to deal with a lot of things just because your brain works differently.  Reach out and get that help. It's worth the time and effort. \n\nAnd remember! It's not all about meds.  I've learned how to write things down and schedule, stop procrastinating so much, getting on a consistent sleep schedule, etc.   Changing habits is really part of moving forward, but my meds have impacted me positively in creating positive habits.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3xxv6p", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I got help!

I made a real effort this time around to make sure I knew my professors, went to their office hours, etc.  Besides lectures, I stopped by his office at least once a week/two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of really good talks that were class-related, but later evolved into &amp;#39;regular life&amp;#39; subjects that were a little personal, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; suggestive in any way.  He and I have a lot in common, same taste in music, and we&amp;#39;re the same age (he&amp;#39;s two years older than me).  I never thought about it much beyond that, and never brought up that I was in a relationship.  Frankly, I didn&amp;#39;t want to come across as an egomaniac by bringing it up out of nowhere.  And like I said, our talks weren&amp;#39;t ever flirtatious so it never came up.  Nevertheless, treated me warmly during class, and called on me often.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago in class, I was in discussion group talking about the subject matter, and I brought my boyfriend up by way of a relevant joke (long story).  Looking back, I know my professor heard me since the group was less than five feet away from him, but it didn&amp;#39;t register to me at the time to gauge his reaction.  I mean, why the hell would it even matter?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Up until a few weeks ago, I had a 96-98% in the class.  I worked my ass off to meet every deadline, the subject matter is of great interest to me so I could focus on the material, and I had the grades to show for it in spite of ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;However, I then started noticing that he was being short with me during class, avoiding me when I had questions after class, ignoring my raised hand, and just generally being weird.   Then, he started taking points off my grade for being late and &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t understand why&lt;/em&gt;.   I am &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; late.  For &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.  Including said class. He had always been pretty understanding, and didn&amp;#39;t deduct points in the past, so why now??&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Later on, we had an assignment that I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; I knew what I was doing, but I ended up getting an F.  (12/25 ~ 48%).  So, well over half of the semester I went from getting &lt;strong&gt;no less&lt;/strong&gt; than a 96% on an assignment (including the midterm which was all essay) to a fucking F.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was kind of in shock, because &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t understand.  How did I fuck up a basic outline?  At the end of class, I asked if I could redo the assignment, because moments before he said he would accept late papers from people who hadn&amp;#39;t even bothered to turn them in yet.  It was like a week past the due date.  He said no.  Honestly, what in the actual fuck?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up getting super fucking pissed and later wrote the most respectful yet confrontational email I could muster.  He was short in his response, and so I went to his office.  He agreed it wasn&amp;#39;t fair and allowed me to redo it.  Yay, right?  So we chatted a little, and I apologized for my lateness by explaining, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;that even though it&amp;#39;s not an excuse, I just found found out I have ADHD, and I&amp;#39;m trying to work on it.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;  He basically said, &amp;quot;Wow, that explains a lot...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on my outline, so freaked out about it given all the drama, that I had a fucking anxiety attack so bad that I couldn&amp;#39;t comprehend 90% of the words I was trying to read.  Every. single. time. I tried to hold on to the meaning of just a single word, it got blocked.  So I just stared at the wall and cried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it subsided enough so that I was able to work again, but I missed class.  I emailed it to him a few hours later, after I had attempted to finish it for fourteen hours.  In the email, I didn&amp;#39;t go into too much detail, but emphasized that I worked really hard on it, and that I was just had a lot of trouble with it. &lt;strong&gt;he accepted it, but still took off late points.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On the last day of class, we turned in our research papers, and were given a list of topics for the final.  There was also coffee and cookie cakes that someone brought in.  I showed up ten minutes late yet &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; despite my best efforts, but thankfully he hadn\u2019t collected the papers yet. Everyone was just talking and eating.   Later, we barely went over the topics because everyone just wanted to leave.   &lt;em&gt;It wasn\u2019t even an actual class, it was a goddamn cookie party, and yet he still took more fucking points off of my grade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Today, I found out I got a low B on my research paper.  I thought I did A work, but I guess it really isn&amp;#39;t up to me.   The final is online and the deadline is tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so fucking mad.  How in the fucking fuck could an educator with a doctoral degree in the study of &lt;strong&gt;MORAL PRINCIPLES&lt;/strong&gt; not be just a little bit understanding of that fact that I have a cognitive function disorder?  Perhaps I&amp;#39;m delusional but his new grading style seems very intentional.   Or I&amp;#39;m egotistical and my having a boyfriend &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; matter.  Maybe my prof just thinks I&amp;#39;m a total asshole.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;being on time should be so fucking easy...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;why. can&amp;#39;t.

I emailed it to him a few hours later, after I had attempted to finish it for fourteen hours.

Nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "***\n*TL;DR --Had an overall positive platonic relationship with my professor, something changed, and now he's no longer friendly.  Out of nowhere my grades have been suffering*\n  ^(note-we're not involved)\n***\n\n*33/f\n*2nd time college freshman\n*Diagnosed ADHD 5 months ago\n*Just now taking Adderall\n*thisclose to earning a 4.0 for the first time ever (really proud I did it without meds, but at the same time I'm so stressed I wanna kill myself)\n***\n\n  So, my professor and I had an pretty amicable relationship.  I made a real effort this time around to make sure I knew my professors, went to their office hours, etc.  Besides lectures, I stopped by his office at least once a week/two weeks.\n\n  We had a lot of really good talks that were class-related, but later evolved into 'regular life' subjects that were a little personal, but *not* suggestive in any way.  He and I have a lot in common, same taste in music, and we're the same age (he's two years older than me).  I never thought about it much beyond that, and never brought up that I was in a relationship.  Frankly, I didn't want to come across as an egomaniac by bringing it up out of nowhere.  And like I said, our talks weren't ever flirtatious so it never came up.  Nevertheless, treated me warmly during class, and called on me often.  \n\n  A few weeks ago in class, I was in discussion group talking about the subject matter, and I brought my boyfriend up by way of a relevant joke (long story).  Looking back, I know my professor heard me since the group was less than five feet away from him, but it didn't register to me at the time to gauge his reaction.  I mean, why the hell would it even matter?\n\n   Up until a few weeks ago, I had a 96-98% in the class.  I worked my ass off to meet every deadline, the subject matter is of great interest to me so I could focus on the material, and I had the grades to show for it in spite of ADHD.\n\n   However, I then started noticing that he was being short with me during class, avoiding me when I had questions after class, ignoring my raised hand, and just generally being weird.   Then, he started taking points off my grade for being late and *I didn't understand why*.   I am **always** late.  For *everything*.  Including said class. He had always been pretty understanding, and didn't deduct points in the past, so why now??\n\n  Later on, we had an assignment that I *thought* I knew what I was doing, but I ended up getting an F.  (12/25 ~ 48%).  So, well over half of the semester I went from getting **no less** than a 96% on an assignment (including the midterm which was all essay) to a fucking F.\n\n  I was kind of in shock, because *again* I didn't understand.  How did I fuck up a basic outline?  At the end of class, I asked if I could redo the assignment, because moments before he said he would accept late papers from people who hadn't even bothered to turn them in yet.  It was like a week past the due date.  He said no.  Honestly, what in the actual fuck?\n\n  I ended up getting super fucking pissed and later wrote the most respectful, yet confrontational email I could muster.  He was short in his response, and so I went to his office.  He agreed it wasn't fair and allowed me to redo it.  Yay, right?  So we chatted a little, and I apologized for my lateness by explaining, **\"that even though it's not an excuse, I just found found out I have ADHD, and I'm trying to work on it.\"**  He basically said, \"Wow, that explains a lot...\"\n\n  I worked on my outline, so freaked out about it at this point given all the drama, that I had a fucking anxiety attack so bad that I couldn't comprehend 90% of the words I was trying to read.

If its metformin I think it'll be fine since last time I used it it took me 3 months from my skin to really clear up. But if its because of the adderall I honestly would just stop using it. Adderall helps me a LOT and honestly its hard to function without it but it doesn't seem worth it. I survived my whole life unmedicated but my skin is something I've had problems with for so long and I thought I would finally get to have clear skin! I have no idea what to do. Has anyone else seen that adderall has caused them to break out? Oh and I take 5mg a day of Adderall if that's relevant. \n\nSorry if this is hard to read or all over the place. I didn't take any Addy today because I'm so scared for my skin. I have scars from over 3 years ago that I've been working to heal and now I'm having this issue all over again!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3qvwwu", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Breakouts from adderall?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_3qvwwu", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/3qvwwu/breakouts_from_adderall/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1446266123.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/3qvwwu/breakouts_from_adderall/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "settingfires", "created_utc": 1446237323.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;...because, with or without meds, I am a wreck!

I believe I was on adderall sometime in middle school, but for whatever reason, stimulants didn&amp;#39;t help when I was that age, and so I didn&amp;#39;t try any from middle school until about 4 months ago. I wasn&amp;#39;t on any adhd medication from ages 14-19, due to nothing that I tried having any benefits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things I have tried recently:\nBupropion XR, varied from 150mg to 300mg. Didn&amp;#39;t really help on it&amp;#39;s own, have been taking it steadily at the same time as every other medication listed here, at the advice of my doctor.\nAdderall XR, varied from 10mg to 40mg. Began with 10mg, this is the first thing that I tried, was prescribed it approximately 4 months ago when I finally got fed up with not being able to make myself do anything and having constant brain fog. Didn&amp;#39;t think it would work, but about 20 minutes after I tried 10mg on the first day, it was everything I could have hoped for. I could think, I could move around easily, I could ignore sounds and sights that would have distracted me before, I could actually talk in more than poorly enunciated short sentences, and I could actually mentally and verbally respond to people in complex conversations, and I could make myself do chores and homework. The first thing I did was clean up my room, and not only was I able to complete that, I vacuumed it, and then started working on my homework that I hadn&amp;#39;t touched in the week since I had gotten it. Additionally, when I felt it kick in, there was a cool feeling in parts of my brain(specifically the front of the frontal lobe and somewhere around the highest part of the rear of the frontal lobe/somatomotor cortex) , and the base of my tongue, after which I felt all the previously mentioned effects. It didn&amp;#39;t feel unpleasantly cold, more like having a cold glass of water on a hot day. Unfortunately, I barely felt anything the next day, and there was barely any improvement from before I started the adderall in the amount of brain fog. I gradually increased the dosage, at the request of my doctor, ending up at 30mg. This seemed to help decently, although nowhere near as much as I had hoped. The first time I went up to this dosage, it felt like the first time I tried adderall. I was on this dosage for about 2 weeks before going up to 40, which didn&amp;#39;t seem to help very much. If anything, it felt worse than the 30mg, but when I went back down to 30, the positive effects seemed much lessened, and my doctor told me to go back up to 40. It was on this that I first noticed that my heartbeat seemed fast, and caused me worry when I exercised. I got an ECG, but it didn&amp;#39;t find anything. After a week of that, he had my double the bupropion, up to 300mg. Around 5 hours after taking that and the 40mg of adderall for the first time, I had an an odd influx of clarity, although something about it felt unpleasant. It only lasted around half an hour, and then wore off unevenly, some effects, such as the conversational abilities, going away first, which I had never felt before. It also felt like I was manic, which was highly unpleasant, as I was fully aware of how it wasn&amp;#39;t normal, but was unable to make myself slow down. I have never felt like that before. I got my doctor to let me lower the bupropion about a week and a half later. \nOther things I have tried: \nMethylphenidate, I forget the dosages, but I started off with a low dosage and then went higher. It felt extremely unpleasant, and I felt locked in when doing tasks, and if anything, it felt like it increased the brain fog. \nDexedrine: It helped with being able to make myself do things, but didn&amp;#39;t help at all with clarity and everything else. I also had bad crashes in the evenings whenever I used it, becoming extremely irritable and distractible.\nVyvanse: Started off with 30mg, went up to two of those per day. Not sure whether/how much it helped. The brain fog seemed slightly better than without, but not enough to really make a difference. I was able to occasionally make myself do things, but it wasn&amp;#39;t reliable. \nWhat I&amp;#39;m on right now is the non-XR adderall, 10mg, taken 3 times a day, and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be helping, but it&amp;#39;s only the second day of trying it, so I&amp;#39;m going to stay with it for a week more at minimum. \nMy biggest problems are the brain fog and the being able to make myself do things, and if anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've been on various adhd meds for about 4 months, and nothing seems to work reliably.

I wasn't on any adhd medication from ages 14-19, due to nothing that I tried having any benefits. \n\nThings I have tried recently:\nBupropion XR, varied from 150mg to 300mg. Didn't really help on it's own, have been taking it steadily at the same time as every other medication listed here, at the advice of my doctor.\nAdderall XR, varied from 10mg to 40mg. Began with 10mg, this is the first thing that I tried, was prescribed it approximately 4 months ago when I finally got fed up with not being able to make myself do anything and having constant brain fog. Didn't think it would work, but about 20 minutes after I tried 10mg on the first day, it was everything I could have hoped for. I could think, I could move around easily, I could ignore sounds and sights that would have distracted me before, I could actually talk in more than poorly enunciated short sentences, and I could actually mentally and verbally respond to people in complex conversations, and I could make myself do chores and homework. The first thing I did was clean up my room, and not only was I able to complete that, I vacuumed it, and then started working on my homework that I hadn't touched in the week since I had gotten it. Additionally, when I felt it kick in, there was a cool feeling in parts of my brain(specifically the front of the frontal lobe and somewhere around the highest part of the rear of the frontal lobe/somatomotor cortex) , and the base of my tongue, after which I felt all the previously mentioned effects. It didn't feel unpleasantly cold, more like having a cold glass of water on a hot day. Unfortunately, I barely felt anything the next day, and there was barely any improvement from before I started the adderall in the amount of brain fog. I gradually increased the dosage, at the request of my doctor, ending up at 30mg. This seemed to help decently, although nowhere near as much as I had hoped. The first time I went up to this dosage, it felt like the first time I tried adderall. I was on this dosage for about 2 weeks before going up to 40, which didn't seem to help very much. If anything, it felt worse than the 30mg, but when I went back down to 30, the positive effects seemed much lessened, and my doctor told me to go back up to 40. It was on this that I first noticed that my heartbeat seemed fast, and caused me worry when I exercised. I got an ECG, but it didn't find anything. After a week of that, he had my double the bupropion, up to 300mg. Around 5 hours after taking that and the 40mg of adderall for the first time, I had an an odd influx of clarity, although something about it felt unpleasant. It only lasted around half an hour, and then wore off unevenly, some effects, such as the conversational abilities, going away first, which I had never felt before. It also felt like I was manic, which was highly unpleasant, as I was fully aware of how it wasn't normal, but was unable to make myself slow down. I have never felt like that before. I got my doctor to let me lower the bupropion about a week and a half later. \nOther things I have tried: \nMethylphenidate, I forget the dosages, but I started off with a low dosage and then went higher. It felt extremely unpleasant, and I felt locked in when doing tasks, and if anything, it felt like it increased the brain fog. \nDexedrine: It helped with being able to make myself do things, but didn't help at all with clarity and everything else. I also had bad crashes in the evenings whenever I used it, becoming extremely irritable and distractible.\nVyvanse: Started off with 30mg, went up to two of those per day. Not sure whether/how much it helped. The brain fog seemed slightly better than without, but not enough to really make a difference. I was able to occasionally make myself do things, but it wasn't reliable. \nWhat I'm on right now is the non-XR adderall, 10mg, taken 3 times a day, and it doesn't seem to be helping, but it's only the second day of trying it, so I'm going to stay with it for a week more at minimum. \nMy biggest problems are the brain fog and the being able to make myself do things, and if anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it. \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3qrdck", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Meds aren't working, anyone have advice?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_3qrdck", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/3qrdck/meds_arent_working_anyone_have_advice/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1446183728.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/3qrdck/meds_arent_working_anyone_have_advice/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "DawnByrd", "created_utc": 1446154928.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all!

I remember my last post here and since then I&amp;#39;ve been doing my adderall thing and I realized just now how much better I&amp;#39;ve gotten. Wow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on&lt;/strong&gt; what I think is a proper dose of Adderall for me (30mg). This is the start of my second month at this dose, actually. The house is looking MUCH better even if I&amp;#39;m still having some problems with my own hygiene--which is odd. I used to love showers and shaving because I&amp;#39;m a wet shaver with fancy soaps and all and since I lost the drive to do literally anything, I&amp;#39;m STILL struggling to get back into the habit of every other day instead of like... an embarrassing twice a week (I keep clean though!!! I promise I&amp;#39;m not gross!). ): But yet, I can pluck my eyebrows and actually make them SYMMETRICAL FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, &lt;strong&gt;WHAT&lt;/strong&gt;, I have been in the habit of brushing my teeth every day (I&amp;#39;ve been working on this for a while, I used to have a bad, BAD problem with that), and haven&amp;#39;t missed a day in over a year. It&amp;#39;s a little odd, I think, that I&amp;#39;m celebrating my fucking hygiene improvements, but I hope other people understand at least!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from that though,&lt;/strong&gt; the house looks good. The tub stays clean. The sink (mostly) stays empty. The floors stay swept and vacuumed and clean. Things stay tidy. i still have just a tiny problem (read: help pls) with the laundry, but even &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; has gotten so much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have found peace, at last.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m still very upset I can&amp;#39;t find a job that is reasonable for me (my car recently exploded and I&amp;#39;d RATHER not commute for an hour+ every day one way to get to work on top of looking all pretty and all that so...), but otherwise, my depression has been the mildest it has literally ever been. I take bupropion on the side (which is amazing, just by the way) which was doing wonders until.... earlier this year? I want to say earlier this year. Then I had to get the leftover shitty anxiety (and my abnormally fast heart rate, yay SVT) under control. Between then and the time I got the Adderall, I just shut down completely. I recently found out that I&amp;#39;m not alone in that! And that was SO relieving to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I finally feel like the person I&amp;#39;m supposed to be.&lt;/strong&gt; I have very good days and I have some...eh, kinda bad days as opposed to kind of okay days and very bad days. I&amp;#39;m the happy, perky optimist I&amp;#39;ve always known I was. Now, if only they made medication for resting bitch-face...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t really understand HOW MUCH of a difference&lt;/strong&gt; the Adderall made in me until this morning. I forgot to get my script filled yesterday and it was very difficult to get out of bed this morning (not so much sleep, happens), so I didn&amp;#39;t get the meds until very late in the day. Between 9AM and 2PM, it was like my brain was actively erasing entire blocks of five minutes from my memory. I spent ten minutes looking for my purse. Fiance pointed to the couch and said I&amp;#39;d put it there. Then, I couldn&amp;#39;t find my phone. I freaked out because I KNEW I definitely just had it. ...it was in my purse. It was then, and ONLY then that I remembered picking my purse up from its usual place, dropping my phone in it, and putting it down to.... idk, look for my purse or something? LOL. Also, holy SHIT I couldn&amp;#39;t stop talking. And I was &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt;. Fiance insists I wasn&amp;#39;t really loud, but I realized that I&amp;#39;m in the middle of Wendy&amp;#39;s just talking away about controversial issues like we&amp;#39;re the only ones there (which, to be fair, we were). Whoops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;d already learned a few weeks ago&lt;/strong&gt; that having coffee on an empty stomach before having the adderall is NEVER, EVER, &lt;strong&gt;EVER&lt;/strong&gt; an option. EVER. I was literally vibrating. I think I might have taken off into orbit if I jumped just the right way. I also could not stop talking. As in I was continuously going without letting my poor conversation partner say much. Fiance pointed it out to me and I felt so shit the rest of the day because I definitely thought that was something I had under control, and how embarrassing!!! The very odd thing is how insidious being without medication is. I felt perfectly fine today, was perky enough, was okay doing things, but it was like suddenly, I realized how spaced out and kinda&amp;#39; useless my brain was and THAT was what hit me like a sack of bricks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, my favorite part:&lt;/strong&gt; My cooking. Holy. Mother. Of God. I was a good cook before. I was a pretty excellent cook before. I cook plant-based (even though lately I&amp;#39;ve been eating an embarrassing amount of fast food because I keep forgetting to eat... ): ) so I have an &amp;quot;odd&amp;quot;, unique way of making pretty much everything from baked goods to side dishes to full dinners. People really love it. People who hate beans will eat my beans because it&amp;#39;s like nothing they&amp;#39;ve ever had. They actively choose my stuff over the &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; stuff during Thanksgiving, which is a HUGE compliment to me considering the family is very traditional.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lately, though&lt;/strong&gt;... I&amp;#39;ve been making the best food I&amp;#39;ve ever, ever put out. I cried making german chocolate cake because the cake just popped right out of the pan, no falling, no residue left on the pan, nothing like that. The frosting came out absolutely perfect. It was seriously perfection as cake. The person the cake was meant for even noted the difference between this one and my last one. The pie crust I&amp;#39;ve been making has been... well, people actually WANT to eat the crust. We actually fought over the crust leftovers (said no one ever). Hell, even the pumpkin pie I made last night was the absolute best I&amp;#39;ve made, and I&amp;#39;ve been at it for like 3 years, now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a last odd thing,&lt;/strong&gt; I would like to see if someone has some extra insight for me. I&amp;#39;m a musician (or, was anyway), and in high school I was NOTORIOUS for being half a beat behind everything else. I had to compensate by being early for everything so I&amp;#39;d be on time. It was a very difficult thing to gauge. Anyway, it&amp;#39;s something I never grew out of, and Fiance the musician laughs t me every time I try to sing or drum out beats because... well... yeah, no good. However, since I&amp;#39;ve gotten on the bupropion, that issue resolved. Like, immediately. Very immediately. Two hours into my first dose, immediately. It&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve been so pleasantly confused about. Would love to hear the science about it, but it&amp;#39;s such a hard thing to google up. Either way, now with the Adderall, I&amp;#39;m seeing music in an entirely new way. Everything is so beautiful. I hear things I never noticed before. Meanings are clear, lyrics are able to be heard properly instead of blurring into everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short because I think I&amp;#39;ve been going on WAY too long&lt;/strong&gt;, this stuff has seriously changed my life in ways I never even thought I needed it changed. I had to share this with someone because I&amp;#39;m just so excited all the time about life. I feel like I exist as a person, and not just several bundles of nerves, neuroses and not very socially acceptable oddities shoved into a (meh, fairly attractive) meat-suit. I&amp;#39;m not a superhero by any means now, but I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m getting better at this &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; thing (only about 8 years late, not bad) little by little. I&amp;#39;m an average person on terms of what I do with the house, how I handle my major responsibilities, the like. There&amp;#39;s still a lot to be done of course, because you don&amp;#39;t just magically recover from 26 years of untreated ADHD in only three months. That&amp;#39;s been the biggest lesson. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They always say you need to keep swimming&lt;/strong&gt;, that you shouldn&amp;#39;t stay still to stagnate, and I can finally get moving again. Just gotta shake the algae off, now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry for the length-- I&amp;#39;ve bolded the first few words in each paragraph to try to keep it all separate.

I'm a musician (or, was anyway), and in high school I was NOTORIOUS for being half a beat behind everything else. I had to compensate by being early for everything so I'd be on time. It was a very difficult thing to gauge. Anyway, it's something I never grew out of, and Fiance the musician laughs t me every time I try to sing or drum out beats because... well... yeah, no good. However, since I've gotten on the bupropion, that issue resolved. Like, immediately. Very immediately. Two hours into my first dose, immediately. It's something I've been so pleasantly confused about. Would love to hear the science about it, but it's such a hard thing to google up. Either way, now with the Adderall, I'm seeing music in an entirely new way. Everything is so beautiful. I hear things I never noticed before. Meanings are clear, lyrics are able to be heard properly instead of blurring into everything.\n\n**In short because I think I've been going on WAY too long**, this stuff has seriously changed my life in ways I never even thought I needed it changed. I had to share this with someone because I'm just so excited all the time about life. I feel like I exist as a person, and not just several bundles of nerves, neuroses and not very socially acceptable oddities shoved into a (meh, fairly attractive) meat-suit. I'm not a superhero by any means now, but I'm *me*. I'm getting better at this \"adult\" thing (only about 8 years late, not bad) little by little. I'm an average person on terms of what I do with the house, how I handle my major responsibilities, the like. There's still a lot to be done of course, because you don't just magically recover from 26 years of untreated ADHD in only three months. That's been the biggest lesson. \n\n**They always say you need to keep swimming**, that you shouldn't stay still to stagnate, and I can finally get moving again. Just gotta shake the algae off, now.\n\n**Thanks for reading.** Sorry for the length-- I've bolded the first few words in each paragraph to try to keep it all separate.

We help a family that we are close with because they do not have a vehicle. The problem was, my brakes were screeching like bloody murder! On the way, my husband wanted me to take the highway, which would have been faster, but I wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable with that because my brakes were horrible. I have a thing about being late and although we were behind schedule, I wasn&amp;#39;t in full panic mode. We made it to our friends and we were about to turn into our destination...and then the BRAKES FAILED. I had to shift into park to avoid hitting the car ahead of me! We made it there, but I still had to go back and get two more people that wouldn&amp;#39;t fit... that&amp;#39;s when panic began to ensue. I was risking it, already with the brakes, plus I was going to be late... I managed to pick up the last 2 people, but we were so late that we missed service. I held it together and didn&amp;#39;t have a melt down, but I was so upset. On the upside, the family was kind enough to help me get my brakes fixed. They were a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; help. I can&amp;#39;t say adderall fixed my anxiety. It did however help me manage my emotions better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same day, while being annoyed/scared about my brake situation, two people I love and care about were there. I&amp;#39;m not usually a touchy-feely person. I&amp;#39;m that person that would prefer you ask before running up and hugging me. Even with people I really like, it&amp;#39;s just awkward for me. Especially when I&amp;#39;m in a bad mood. I was able to hug my two dear friends with real emotion. Nothing else mattered at that moment. It was great! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next issue came a few days later... my mother wanted to go to walmart. She invited me. Initially I declined. I don&amp;#39;t really get along with Mom...but ehhh I decided to be nice. I had forgotten to take my morning dose of blood pressure medication and I needed to also take my adderall. One wise user here advised me to take BP med first, then wake up later and take adderall, but I completely forgot. &lt;strong&gt;Another thing is, my mother was rushing me... I hate being rushed...ugh!&lt;/strong&gt; By the time we got to walmart, I had taken my medication but did not bring a cool drink. I felt a little jumpy and hot. I can imagine my heart rate was elevated, but I managed to do what I needed to in walmart. I got back home and relaxed and then got ready for a BBQ. I was having some hesitations as I am not always good in social situations. Plus, the BBQ was with some friends that we had an arguement with and while the men had worked out their issues, I hadn&amp;#39;t really talked to the wife. I felt some uneasiness. As we were driving there, I really thought of just saying nevermind and not going, but everyone was warm and welcoming. No problems. Towards the end of the evening, I started having some ADHD moments, (forgetting things, doing little odd things like having fruit salad and covering the cups with a plastic baggy and foil...one or the other would have been more than fine). I tried to be patient with myself. I knew I would running on fumes, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to take a second dose so late in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All and all it&amp;#39;s going okay.

So let me start by saying:\nDay 1 was scary. I picked up my medication from my local pharmacy and it was too late in the evening to take it the same day the doctor wrote it. I sat in the pharmacy which is not something I usually do. I watched someone else, &lt;strong&gt;POSSIBLY&lt;/strong&gt; with a script for a narcotic that could not be filled. It was out of state and past 7 days. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be too nosey, but it&amp;#39;s a small area and I couldn&amp;#39;t help overhearing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I sat that, I was nervous... do I really &lt;strong&gt;NEED&lt;/strong&gt; this medication? What is it going to do to me? What about my blood pressure? What if I have an allergic reaction?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pharmacist warned me that it could raise my blood pressure and to be mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I brought it home and hid it in my nightstand. I didn&amp;#39;t even tell my husband. Why?

It took me a moment to actually take the adderall...there was no going back...

I wasn&amp;#39;t overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day was a big test for me. I had to go grocery shopping. A typical trip to walmart prior to medication would take me at least an hour, even for just one or two small things. I would get distracted by things in the store. If I went past the arts and crafts section, I would start dreaming of things I could create, although I wasn&amp;#39;t gifted in that area. I could have a list and still manage to forget things although they could be right in front of my face and I knew I liked them. That day was different. I had my list on my phone and brought my big cup of water and I got the things I came in for. My list took me maybe 45 minutes and I had a cart full of groceries. I noticed I was sweating that day, but it could have been that it was hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week went okay. I know one day I took my morning dose and then afternoon doses when it was time, but I hadn&amp;#39;t really slept the night before. I was still exhausted. I was more focused then without meds but I was still tired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really like an afternoon dose thus far because I find it really hard to wind down. I&amp;#39;m anxious to see the changes after I begin working out and making dietary changes in addition to the medication. I also need to monitor my blood pressure, rather than just saying it feels high, but the one I have at home is a wrist one that varies in readings and also smells like smoke from the people I live with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try my best to also monitor caffeine when I have medication in my system. I don&amp;#39;t want to increase my blood pressure too much because that is not a good feeling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the weekend off and I did okay. One day I forgot my husband&amp;#39;s debit card at home and didn&amp;#39;t realize it until I was already in the store about to use it. But, I didn&amp;#39;t go to pieces. I know I have a problem.

I picked up my medication from my local pharmacy and it was too late in the evening to take it the same day the doctor wrote it. I sat in the pharmacy which is not something I usually do. I watched someone else, **POSSIBLY** with a script for a narcotic that could not be filled. It was out of state and past 7 days. I didn't want to be too nosey, but it's a small area and I couldn't help overhearing. \n\nAs I sat that, I was nervous... do I really **NEED** this medication? What is it going to do to me? What about my blood pressure? What if I have an allergic reaction?\n\nThe pharmacist warned me that it could raise my blood pressure and to be mindful of that.\n\nI brought it home and hid it in my nightstand. I didn't even tell my husband. Why? Because I didn't want to have to explain that ADHD really exists and that I can't do this alone anymore.\n\nThe next morning, I took my blood pressure medicine.

I wanted to share with you my journey in hopes of helping others and self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;m in my mid 30s and just got diagnosed last month. I work in the mental health field and had noticed my symptoms were getting worse...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Where are my keys for work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*What patient am I meeting today?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the grocery store, have a list written, have a text and *&lt;/em&gt;STILL** can&amp;#39;t remember the one thing I came in here for!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Being depressed because I&amp;#39;m in my 30s,not my 80s!

She seemed nice enough so I looked at her post history and saw, oh my God! I&amp;#39;m not alone! There are other people just like me!!! I came here and started looking around and suddenly it all made sense! I&amp;#39;m not stupid or lazy... I&amp;#39;m just a little different!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took the quiz on the side panel and scored 14 out of 15.

I took a big leap of faith, knowing I couldn&amp;#39;t do &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; by myself and called one of the places I bring my patients to. I didn&amp;#39;t want to see the same doctors they see, but the location of the facility is good and it has a nice, calm, atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I met with a therapist...expressed my issues and although I&amp;#39;m not sure I will stick to this lady or not (she&amp;#39;s an older lady, that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to &amp;quot;get me&amp;quot;), she did ask if I wanted to be medicated for my adhd. That was a decision that needed to be made in a split second, but something I really had to think about. I have never taken anything stronger than an antibiotic (except for blood pressure) and taking something for adhd was a difficult decision. But I knew how my life has been thus far, &lt;strong&gt;WITHOUT&lt;/strong&gt; medication...and it&amp;#39;s been hard... I agreed and had to make an appointment with a medication provider (ie a DR, not just a therapist).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met with this Doctor, (who I will now refer to as Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

I&amp;#39;m a Dutch artist (stereotype, I know), diagnosed at 29 while I was studying Fine Art. I had attempted two studies before, then decided I wanted to go back to school to try and improve my lot (not much money, live in a shitty neighborhood, felt like I had no useful talents, felt like I was lazy and stupid etc.) and art is something I have always been passionate about (the other thing being animals) but I was starting to feel overwhelmed when I met someone who also had ADHD. He explained what it was to me and I realized &lt;em&gt;\u201dWell fuck, that&amp;#39;s me to a T.\u201d&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the whole \u201cI have some of those symptoms sometimes.\u201d bullshit some people will give you, but I realized I actually had ADHD (primarily inattentive) that was making my life unnecessarily complicated so I went to consult a psychologist, who confirmed the diagnosis. I was both relieved and super pissed; why had no-one noticed this? I&amp;#39;m pretty much textbook example female ADHD, but no-one even suggested that maybe I should look into consulting a psychiatrist. I guess it was always easier to ignore me, even when I was suicidally depressed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was medicated, but didn&amp;#39;t get much help aside from that, like say, a support group or something. I guess this is it? On-line support is better than nothing of course, but I still feel kind of ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I digress. I graduated and got my BA; my thesis was about reclaiming my life from ADHD and it got high marks.

I'm a Dutch artist (stereotype, I know), diagnosed at 29 while I was studying Fine Art. I had attempted two studies before, then decided I wanted to go back to school to try and improve my lot (not much money, live in a shitty neighborhood, felt like I had no useful talents, felt like I was lazy and stupid etc.) and art is something I have always been passionate about (the other thing being animals) but I was starting to feel overwhelmed when I met someone who also had ADHD. He explained what it was to me and I realized *\u201dWell fuck, that's me to a T.\u201d* \n\n\nNot the whole \u201cI have some of those symptoms sometimes.\u201d bullshit some people will give you, but I realized I actually had ADHD (primarily inattentive) that was making my life unnecessarily complicated so I went to consult a psychologist, who confirmed the diagnosis. I was both relieved and super pissed; why had no-one noticed this? I'm pretty much textbook example female ADHD, but no-one even suggested that maybe I should look into consulting a psychiatrist. I guess it was always easier to ignore me, even when I was suicidally depressed. \n\n\nI was medicated, but didn't get much help aside from that, like say, a support group or something. I guess this is it? On-line support is better than nothing of course, but I still feel kind of ignored.\n\n\nI digress. I graduated and got my BA; my thesis was about reclaiming my life from ADHD and it got high marks. Now I'm considering getting my MA while I live with my husband and my pets, trying not to get overwhelmed and keep on truckin'. Nice to meet you guys!\n\n\nI also wanted to show you guys this installation by one of my favorite artists, Beth Cavener Stichter, that she made on the topic of trying to sneak in/out of somewhere unseen, but being unable to.

Speaking to a faculty advisor, it could be another three years before I graduate. I could theoretically do it sooner but my senior seminar wouldn't be properly supervised. I understand that I'm making it more difficult than necessary, but I really want the best opportunity I can to have my research published... cuz grad school. \n\nCareer goal:\n\nI'd like to be an area expert on Iran/Muslim nations for the US State Department. Area experts give context and advise policy.\n\n**Here is where I could use your help!**\n\nDo I:\n\n1) stay at the local university for 2-3 more years giving me the opportunity to take fewer credits per semester, graduate debt free but with less advantages when applying to grad school;\n\n2) take the next year to improve my GPA, then look to transfer to a more appropriate program where I may take another two years to graduate depending on how well my credits will transfer;\n\n3) look into transferring asap in the hopes that I might finish in two years, rather than 3.\n\n*If you were me (24 (almost 25, so pell grants!), LTR, great job, ADHD-C w/ dysthymia and social anxiety) what would you do?*", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3d9xon", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Help me salvage my degree, pretty please.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 10, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_38hf9", "hide_score": false, "author_cakeday": true, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_3d9xon", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXADHD/comments/3d9xon/help_me_salvage_my_degree_pretty_please/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1436923356.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/3d9xon/help_me_salvage_my_degree_pretty_please/", "author_flair_text": "ADHD-C|\"Wait, what?\"", "quarantine": false, "author": "marijuana_andmakeup", "created_utc": 1436894556.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.TwoXADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "TwoXADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so used to being the family or local screwup that I often feel completely overwhelmed when things actually start going right for once.

I am a 30 year old male professional and was initially diagnosed early with ADHD as a child. My parents initially believed that I would &amp;quot;get over it&amp;quot; and I did too. It wasn&amp;#39;t until mid-college when my life was in shambles that I sought a therapist who quickly diagnosed me with adult ADHD and started me on medication. My life turned around almost overnight and I have gone on to lead a much better life and learn how to deal with these challenges.\nNow as an adult, I have moved to a new city and decided to seek a new doctor. Initially I met with his nurse practitioner who instantly I could tell &amp;quot;did not believe&amp;quot; in ADHD, and insisted that, despite having my previous medical records, I see the general practitioner for his diagnoses. The general practitioner initially only said I should try this &amp;quot;new thing&amp;quot; strattera.\n(Side Note: The strattera did work, but the side effects I experienced have made it a non-option for me).\nIt was at this point I realized that I hadn&amp;#39;t taken advantage of the new glut of information we have access to on the internet regarding ADHD and decided to further educate myself before my next appointment. That is how I found your resources, videos, and other data topics.\nAt the next meeting I felt better armed with more information to bring to the table. It was after making my case (today) to my doctor that he looked straight at me and asked &amp;quot;do you really need medication?&amp;quot; and proceeded to near-debate with me that he believes ADHD is something that can be treated without medication and that medicating ADHD is the wrong thing to do, insisting that all I needed was some cognitive behavioral therapy. After some pleading, he did allow me a prescription of Vyvanse &amp;quot;to try&amp;quot; if I would agree to see a therapist he suggested. However, in our discussion, he mentioned that the therapists he knew &amp;quot;refuse to medicate&amp;quot; for ADHD. So I don&amp;#39;t forsee these meetings being very beneficial; however I intend to go into them with an open mind.\nFinally, I am writing you because, after all I have learned and read, I feel at a loss as to how to best make my case against medical professionals that seem to deny the realities of this. I have encountered this bias before in others &amp;quot;oh why don&amp;#39;t you just do this better&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;why don&amp;#39;t you just plan better&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;everyone has those kinds of problems&amp;quot;, etc. but in this case I can&amp;#39;t just ignore the individual. I realize a change in physician is a simple solution, but if possible, I would like to know how to approach this in case I encounter this again in the future.\nLastly, thank you for your time in reading all of this and I truly appreciate all of the research, time, and resources you have dedicated. I have learned a great deal thanks to you and have shared your materials with others which has made all our lives better.\nThank you,\n&lt;a href=\"/u/Kerr_\"&gt;/u/Kerr_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Response&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;a href=\"/u/Kerr_\"&gt;/u/Kerr_&lt;/a&gt;,\nThanks for writing. As I am traveling now I must be brief in my reply. I can understand how frustrating this can be because I also encounter this when I lecture at hospitals and medical schools, especially to those physicians unfamiliar with the substantial research on adult ADHD. Their practice at times seems driven by the mainstream media coverage of ADHD (its a myth, its over-diagnosed, its over-medicated, etc.). One approach you can use is to share some clinical research reports on adult ADHD with them (see attached). Yet this is at the risk of their taking offense to a patient trying to educate them, the expert. Still, if such offense is taken, then you are probably at the wrong clinic for meeting your needs so might as well find someone more expert. Second, if you tell me the nearest large city to you I may be able to direct you to people I may know more expert in ADHD management than your current provider, should you wish to get a second opinion or change providers. Third, direct them to my lectures to professionals that have been posted to YouTube, some of which you have likely seen. Or send them to ADHDLectures.com for free views of similar lectures. Again, this assumes they are open to such education. Fourth, check the chadd.org website to see if there is a CHADD chapter near you and how to contact them if there is one. That organization will have ferreted out the best professionals in your region for dealing with ADHD. Then switch your care to them. After all, why should you have to waste time educating your care provider - its not your job, really.\nAs for CBT, even those who developed this method for adults with ADHD (Safren, Ramsay, Solanto) recognize in the treatment manuals that it is no where near as effective as medication and often must be combined with medication for the patient to profit from the CBT. So viewing CBT as a stand alone treatment has little support in the scientific literature.\nBe well,\nRussell A. Barkley, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it!

Again, this assumes they are open to such education. Fourth, check the chadd.org website to see if there is a CHADD chapter near you and how to contact them if there is one. That organization will have ferreted out the best professionals in your region for dealing with ADHD. Then switch your care to them. After all, why should you have to waste time educating your care provider - its not your job, really.\nAs for CBT, even those who developed this method for adults with ADHD (Safren, Ramsay, Solanto) recognize in the treatment manuals that it is no where near as effective as medication and often must be combined with medication for the patient to profit from the CBT. So viewing CBT as a stand alone treatment has little support in the scientific literature.\nBe well,\nRussell A. Barkley, Ph.D.\n\n________\nAnd that's it!
