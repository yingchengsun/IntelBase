In my last post, I talked a lot about the funding and support I got from my school and government for having ADHD and a few people asked me for tips for performing well in school. I decided to make a post here as hopefully a few of you will appreciate it. If you\u2019ve got tips of your own, share them in the comments! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some backstory: I\u2019m 20F, got diagnosed with ADHD last year. First year uni before being diagnosed my grades took a significant dip from beginning with 4.0 and dropping to 3.2GPA. Not to mention my mental health spiralled as well. I knew something was wrong but I didn\u2019t know what. I knew I was capable of doing well but felt like getting back on that path was impossible. After some time visiting doctors, counsellors and psychiatrists I was diagnosed with ADHD and since have been provided with an amazing amount of resources when it comes to help in doing well. I\u2019m now in school double-majoring in music therapy and psychology and I absolutely love being in school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some tips &amp;amp; tricks \n1. Have a calendar up in your room/office/study space. Have it somewhere you\u2019ll see everyday and write when your biggest assignments are due in one colour, when you work in another, and your appointments in another. This has helped me plan my time by being able to visually see my timeline. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use an app that discourages phone use when you\u2019re studying. I use an app called forest where if you\u2019re away from your phone for the set time, you\u2019ll plant a tree and get points. Eventually with those points you can buy a real free for a forest that\u2019s being rebuilt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small study sessions &amp;gt; cramming. Easier said than done. This has been a tough one for me, as I sometimes do my best work when I\u2019m cramming. Basically, you need to find a time when you\u2019re mentally motivated to do something enough that you\u2019ll actually do it. I\u2019d think something like \u201chey, your exam is in 2 weeks but you need to do a ton of reading\u201d and then I\u2019d think that I could put it off and I\u2019d end up being so behind in reading that I couldn\u2019t catch up. I decided to break down the reading and make a certain amount due every week. That way, I\u2019d feel that stress to get it done with the due date and wouldn\u2019t end up being completely overwhelmed. Another thing, don\u2019t hyperfixate. As much as you might feel like you can cram for an exam by doing it all at once, you will feel tired and cranky and will not absorb as much information if you sit there for 5hrs straight. Set a timer for yourself to make sure you at least take little breaks if you decide to cram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a comfortable study space! This is so important. I\u2019m blessed by having my school essentially in a forest so I\u2019m able to find a quiet area by windows of beautiful views. I feel comfortable there, and typically stay there studying longer. I don\u2019t get too distracted but can still stop and appreciate the view from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to music if it helps, don\u2019t listen to music if it\u2019s distracting. Sometimes for me Music can be a great motivator and helps keep focus. Other days it can actually end up distracting me to the point where it\u2019s impairing my ability to learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re comfortable using a laptop, I recommend taking notes on there and recording lectures. I use OneNote for this and it has changed the game for me. OneNote lines up the lecture with what you\u2019re typing so you\u2019re able to go back and replay the lecture if you click on a point in your notes and can\u2019t remember the context. I also share my notes with my class because it motivates me to take better notes and pay more attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get some sleeeeeep. I hate this one because I have trouble with it but your brain will be so much better off and ready to concentrate if you get 7-8 hrs of sleep. It\u2019s hypothesized that ADHD brains actually may benefit from more sleep than your average person, but find what works for you and stick to it. That means stop using your phone 30 mins before bed, dim the lights, take a shower, have some herbal tea. I use this 30 min time to make myself a lunch for the next day which really makes my mornings easier. If you still feel awake, pop in a melatonin but I try to steer clear from melatonin supplements because your body will make it naturally unless it\u2019s already there which will end up making it harder to get to bed on your own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like exercising, exercise in the morning/afternoon. Exercise is shown to release chemicals that improve cognitive functioning, but many people have trouble settling down after a workout. If you\u2019re one of those people then try not to work out too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce stress by doing things that habitually calm you down. Cuddle your S/O, play some music, take a bath, draw. Find your thing and try to do it at least once every few days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a network of study buddies where you meet or have an online group that exchanges notes and discusses the material. It\u2019s fun and it\u2019s memorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for ADHD resources that may be available at your school. Visit accessibility/disability services and inquire about counselling,support, tutoring or funding. If you\u2019re in Canada schools are typically required to provide these resources to you and they will help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s all I can think of for now.

Then again, I could have been squashed by a semi truck and have had a closed casket funeral a year ago if I didn\u2019t have it. \nJust some thoughts and suggestions from other with similar experiences would be nice. \n\n\u201c*You must take control of the life you\u2019re given*\u201c - *Nietzsche*\n\n\n**TL;DR** I hyper focused and posted way too much, but basically whenever I get stressed out, like my dad, I take a backseat and my body goes on autopilot. I either rage out and make a stupid decision, or, I do something with unbelievable reflexes that saves my ass. Just want to try and limit how often I get so angry that I become retarded (I.e \u201chulk out\u201d) \n\nP.S- I know therapy is helpful, but I have a real hard problem staying focused whenever someone is talking to me for an extended period of time- especially if it\u2019s about me or what I do. My mind has a near eidetic memory and I just store so much info and make connections to different things I\u2019ve experienced, done, seen, learned, heard about, etc. to random words, facts, smells and new experiences. It only makes sense to me, but if you tell me to talk about myself I have a hard time translating it to others without rambling, so I apologize. For those that can deal with my hyperfocusing rambles, you deserve an adderall-chipped cookie with some caffeinated water and a pack of marlboro NXT cigarettes. Thanks for taking the time to read this shit, this reddit forum has helped me a lot with my depression and adhdness, almost as much as my German Shepherd.

I would really appreciate some advice here but I also need to vent. I&amp;#39;ve had really bad adhd symptoms my entire life. It was never picked up on when I was little probably because I&amp;#39;m innattentive not hyperactive. I was referred to a psychiatrist in high school by my PCP and my mom got so mad about it that she called the Dr. to tell them nothing was wrong with me and I never went back to that practice. She thinks every issue I have is something I can just change by &amp;quot;not being lazy and forgetful&amp;quot;. She has never been supportive of mental health in any way and looks down on people who go to psychiatrists.&lt;br/&gt;\nI began having a really hard time when I got to college and barely skated by my first semester. My best friend had ADHD and was prescribed medication by she still was failing. So we worked out a deal where I took her meds half the week and did half her work. My grades improved dramatically. My mind felt calm for the first time in my life because I felt like the meds helped me filter useless thoughts. I stopped having panic attacks because I wasn&amp;#39;t drowning in my life anymore. I wasn&amp;#39;t chronically late. I think my mood even stabilized but that&amp;#39;s probably because my life just got so much better. I know it was really wrong to take medication that wasn&amp;#39;t mine but I felt like I needed it and being on my parents insurance I knew I couldn&amp;#39;t go to the Dr and get my own script.&lt;br/&gt;\nAbout a year later karma caught up with me. My friend became pregnant so she stopped getting a script. I failed every class that semester. I just couldn&amp;#39;t do it. But I love what I&amp;#39;m studying and I want to succeed. I&amp;#39;ve been skating by this seamster taking another friends med about once a week. I just stay up that whole day and binge work. But I know that I need to be a fucking adult and do the responsible thing so I sucked it up and secretly went to a psychiatrist. I poured my heart out to her and she said she agrees I have ADHD. But she needs me to get an EKG (ECG?) to see whether I can be prescribed stimulants. Getting this test requires me to jump through hoops with the PCP and insurance. So I won&amp;#39;t be able to get meds until after the semester is over. So now I&amp;#39;m just crushed. I thought I would get them this week and be able to dig myself out of the hole I created this semester. But now I&amp;#39;m just scared and lost.

I would really appreciate some advice here but I also need to vent. I've had really bad adhd symptoms my entire life. It was never picked up on when I was little probably because I'm innattentive not hyperactive. I was referred to a psychiatrist in high school by my PCP and my mom got so mad about it that she called the Dr. to tell them nothing was wrong with me and I never went back to that practice. She thinks every issue I have is something I can just change by \"not being lazy and forgetful\". She has never been supportive of mental health in any way and looks down on people who go to psychiatrists.   \nI began having a really hard time when I got to college and barely skated by my first semester. My best friend had ADHD and was prescribed medication by she still was failing. So we worked out a deal where I took her meds half the week and did half her work. My grades improved dramatically. My mind felt calm for the first time in my life because I felt like the meds helped me filter useless thoughts. I stopped having panic attacks because I wasn't drowning in my life anymore. I wasn't chronically late. I think my mood even stabilized but that's probably because my life just got so much better. I know it was really wrong to take medication that wasn't mine but I felt like I needed it and being on my parents insurance I knew I couldn't go to the Dr and get my own script.  \nAbout a year later karma caught up with me. My friend became pregnant so she stopped getting a script. I failed every class that semester. I just couldn't do it. But I love what I'm studying and I want to succeed.

I told the doctor that not only can this just simply not happen, I also can&amp;#39;t get my photography side-hustle to hustle without some &lt;em&gt;hustle-function&lt;/em&gt;. I told him that I don&amp;#39;t want stimulants because I&amp;#39;ve found that Adderall and Ritalin suppress my creative ability and that not only severely impacts my ability to be a good photographer but also my ability to think outside the box at my regular job. So Doc put me on Fluoxetine (an SSRI).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The improvement has been absolutely amazing. My supervisors noticed the change within weeks, and that got noted up the chain.

But wait, there&amp;#39;s more! In late October I met with my boss&amp;#39;s boss&amp;#39;s boss for a phone conference that had to do with my job and we wound up talking for a bit afterwards. A little more background: I&amp;#39;ve worked for the same company for nearly 10 years and I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; worked a 4pm - 3am shift four days a week, except for one glorious week where they wanted some fresh photos for a corporate presentation. He wound up asking me where I wanted to be with the company, so we had a brief conversation about it. Then, in early November, he just walks up to my desk (which was on a production floor, not in a cubicle farm, so think tons of noise and distractions going on for the entire shift) and simply tells me &amp;quot;Monday, 8am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now working directly for him, in a cubicle farm in a mostly quiet office, with my own desk space that I&amp;#39;m free to decorate. I&amp;#39;ve done work for VP&amp;#39;s, quickly become a go-to name for anything to do with spreadsheet automation or data analysis, and I get home in time to pick my daughter up from school and help her with her homework. Every evening is like a little mini-weekend, and my work days aren&amp;#39;t these interminable chunks of time cutting holes out of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here to tell &lt;em&gt;everybody on this sub&lt;/em&gt; that I know there are some of you who are like me, who have something of a handle on ADHD but still get their asses kicked by depression and anxiety on a regular basis.

And, yeah, that doctor&amp;#39;s appointment can be hella expensive, but there&amp;#39;s no dollar amount that&amp;#39;s worth your happiness. I&amp;#39;d rather be ecstatic and broke as hell than rich and miserable. I&amp;#39;m still trying to deal with the absolutely insane bill I got for my half-hour appointment (I have insurance, but they&amp;#39;re under some sort of grandfathering loophole which bails them out of the ACA), but I can do it without freaking out because I&amp;#39;m totally chill.

He started a low dose of IR Adderall to take twice daily as needed and I was so, so optimistic and hopeful. He started getting work done and getting better grades in his online masters program and he started helping me around the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after the first week our relationship just went to absolute shit and we were fighting ALL the time. Things were so horrible. He started drinking every day and using dip (tobacco) all the time. I got upset about the drinking so he started hiding it. He turned really mean, especially when he\u2019d been drinking, and finally it got to the point where I literally sat him down and broke up with him. He was drunk during this conversation and I didn\u2019t even know it. He called me nasty names, refused to believe I was actually serious about breaking up with him, and made fun of me for crying. It was SO OUT OF CHARACTER. I was shocked at how quickly things devolved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s stupid is I\u2019m actually (almost) a pharmacist and I didn\u2019t pick up on certain key stuff.

The IR Adderall should only last like 4 to 6 hours and he would take it once at 9 am and feel the effects at 10 pm. The lack of sleep was driving him insane, as was the lack of sex drive.

How did I not put his crazy behavior together with starting the Adderall??? The one good thing that has come out of this is we realized his communication effing sucks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically what I think happened was that he is a 2D6 non metabolizer. In absolute layman\u2019s terms, everyone has an enzyme in their liver called CYP2D6 that metabolizes a ton of drugs for you. In a decent amount of the Caucasian population, this enzyme doesn\u2019t work properly and you can\u2019t metabolize the drug, so it just sits in your system and keeps doing its job hours and hours later until other enzymes can help pick up the slack.

He\u2019s a full blown alcoholic now, even without the Adderall acting as a trigger/craving point and his sleep being good again. He quits for maybe a day then secretly starts drinking again. It\u2019s awful and I\u2019ve been reading up on the link between substance abuse and ADHD. I\u2019m scared that it\u2019s going to make it even harder for him to get sober. He has an appointment with his psychiatrist in January and the ADHD is making it hard for him to do basic stuff again like making phone calls and looking up a therapist to call too.

I&amp;#39;ve been waking up at 7:00, taking 15mg XR Adderall and falling back to sleep, then waking up an hour later. I can&amp;#39;t believe how effective it is: back in high school (when I took the same dose), I was running after the bus practically every day, and mornings felt like shit. Also, it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to get to bed at night, which was a huge problem for me before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;wasting&amp;quot; Adderall but it&amp;#39;s covered by insurance, and it&amp;#39;s not like it costs them anything. I can actually take the dose my doctor reccommends without having trouble falling asleep at night. I also know that, like all morning routines, I can get psychologically dependent, so I don&amp;#39;t do it every day. It&amp;#39;s much harder for me to wake up without my alarm (&amp;quot;Blackened&amp;quot; my Metallica, which has a nice gradual intro).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, the interesting side effects&lt;/strong&gt;:  almost every day I wake up and I&amp;#39;m incredibly horny. This doesn&amp;#39;t interfere with work, at least not as much as being braindead and tired, but it&amp;#39;s interesting how consistent it is. Unless I&amp;#39;m physically sore from last night, or my mind is focused on something gross, I&amp;#39;m completely obsessed. I also feel more confident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other side effect is that I remember my dreams more often. Most are pleasant. But two really stood out. Both involved death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dream about killing someone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joe Clean (a cross between Joe Rogan and orange Mister Clean) picked up an entire tree and is swinging it at my friends. I tell everyone to stay back. With a stick I poke a patch of ground, which crumbles away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worms and snakes tighten around Joe&amp;#39;s feet. Then the ground starts to cave in. Joe goes into shock: not a look of terror, but a glazed-over calmness where he doesn&amp;#39;t even fight back. It haunts me just how &lt;em&gt;ordinary&lt;/em&gt; he looked, while something in the back of my mind tells me &lt;em&gt;this is what it really looks like when someone&amp;#39;s about to die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The snakes are attacked to a centipede/bobbit worm maw. I panic and yell to him &amp;quot;If you weren&amp;#39;t trying to kill us, I can still get you out of there&amp;quot;.

I've been waking up at 7:00, taking 15mg XR Adderall and falling back to sleep, then waking up an hour later. I can't believe how effective it is: back in high school (when I took the same dose), I was running after the bus practically every day, and mornings felt like shit. Also, it's a lot easier to get to bed at night, which was a huge problem for me before.\n\nI know I'm \"wasting\" Adderall but it's covered by insurance, and it's not like it costs them anything. I can actually take the dose my doctor reccommends without having trouble falling asleep at night. I also know that, like all morning routines, I can get psychologically dependent, so I don't do it every day. It's much harder for me to wake up without my alarm (\"Blackened\" my Metallica, which has a nice gradual intro).\n\n**So, the interesting side effects**:  almost every day I wake up and I'm incredibly horny. This doesn't interfere with work, at least not as much as being braindead and tired, but it's interesting how consistent it is. Unless I'm physically sore from last night, or my mind is focused on something gross, I'm completely obsessed. I also feel more confident.\n\nThe other side effect is that I remember my dreams more often. Most are pleasant. But two really stood out. Both involved death.\n\n---------------------\n\n**The dream about killing someone**\n\nJoe Clean (a cross between Joe Rogan and orange Mister Clean) picked up an entire tree and is swinging it at my friends. I tell everyone to stay back. With a stick I poke a patch of ground, which crumbles away. \n\nWorms and snakes tighten around Joe's feet. Then the ground starts to cave in. Joe goes into shock: not a look of terror, but a glazed-over calmness where he doesn't even fight back. It haunts me just how *ordinary* he looked, while something in the back of my mind tells me *this is what it really looks like when someone's about to die*.\n\n The snakes are attacked to a centipede/bobbit worm maw. I panic and yell to him \"If you weren't trying to kill us, I can still get you out of there\". The maw is up to his waist when he softly says \"no\", but in a way that implies he doesn't trust us. I cut at the snakes with my Swiss Army knife but it's clear I'm too late. I wake up with a profound sense of guilt.\n\n**the dream about dying**\n\nI'm diagnosed with a terminal condition where I will die in 24 hours. My family sits at the table and they don't know what to say. I'm scared. For some reason I drive with my best friend to her Sensei, who in the dream is a fat mustachio'd man in a karate gi.

My school life was always the same, I was told I had the potential but didn\u2019t apply myself. \nOkay so when I was 5 or 6, I fell off the top bunk of a bed and fell head first on to a metal radiator.

Instead they put me back to bed. I woke up some time later with an awful headache. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reasons why I think I have ADHD &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have a very short attention span. I have trouble even listening to a 3 minute song all the way through. If I read something I get inpatient and frustrated. I\u2019ll either end up skimming through the thing and not taking it all in or just stop reading completely. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;something has to really take my interest in order for me to focus on it.

I would love to hear your way to cope with daily live and tasks. I want to have tools to make my weaknesses as something I can controll so I can try to be the person and professional I want to be. Please, help me. Every help and tip is needed. I know this is asked often but just give me link to somewhere where I can find help. I'm desperate. \n\nI'm now homeless, jobless, have many bills and school assigments dangerously overdue and I've ruined relationships with my friends and they are tired of me. \n\nSorry, english is not my native language and there might be many typos.

Learning at school was slow, I made little friends, reading books or listening to a teacher was mentally exhausting. Tests and exams didn&amp;#39;t bother me, however the time limit made me extremely anxious which often lead to me losing focus on questions which resulted in misunderstanding the questions given to me. I worked the best I could in School, so good that I just looked like an average student not putting too much effort in my classes (but I knew I was trying really hard) The teaching methods just didn&amp;#39;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left high school a year early than I was allowed to stay on (Scottish schools allow their pupils to leave after their 4th year around age of 16 so they can have the choice to go straight to work or continue study for an extra year then goto College or Uni) I decided to stay one extra year instead of two to study a course in game design in my nearby city. 10 Months in I got asked to dropout by my teacher who told me something about falling behind on most modules in my course). So I ended up leaving to try a different course entirely, within 2 months I got sick and my attendance was too low and I had to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third year course attempt however was interesting. Digital Media, an introductory course for computer hardware technology. An area I had been studying on my own as a hobby for more than half of my life due to gaming and interest in tweaking Windows machines to push out more performance. Long story short, I was already knowledgeable, however it didn&amp;#39;t take long for my tutor to notice I was slowing down after a couple months. Suddenly during this time people in my class are surpassing me and I&amp;#39;m falling behind again. I didn&amp;#39;t understand why this very scenario keeps on happening, even on subjects I deeply enjoy and my tutor did offer me an alternative to study at home, but outside of college. I accepted that offer to leave the college however I failed to take on this new self-study course on my own. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was a whole challenge of itself, I&amp;#39;ve worked with several different businesses and all of them have practically given me the same challenge. Adjusting to the workplace, understanding new tasks given to me and changing habits. First couple of weeks can be stressful amount of information to take in, I often struggle with businesses that provide me with too much information to learn in a short amount of time. While at work, there are times I get asked to do a task I have never done before, however at the time I may have seen another colleague complete said task. The struggle is still the same, anxiety increases, confidence lowers and suddenly I feel pressured to do a simple task I might misunderstand or get wrong. These added pressures tend to get to me when I least expect it and it all depends if the person I am working with doesn&amp;#39;t mind giving me multiple reminders throughout the week. Habits are a weird one for me that I&amp;#39;ve only recently understood how it works. Basically 90% of the work I do are based on individual processes. Task A gets assigned to me, I do Action AA, once action AA is complete, move onto action AB.... until task is complete. If during Task A, Scenario C happens, I need to do action &amp;#39;CA&amp;#39; in order to proceed. This seems to be how my memory works, if I need to change a certain procedure like when Scenario C happens during Task A, It&amp;#39;s a major challenge for me to modify that older solution to a new one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I do my best and it seems the more work experience I get, the better worker I become. Only since this recent diagnosis has given me far more job security regarding issues that may have arisen due to the condition. It&amp;#39;s also helped my boss understand me and that my ultimate motive at work, is to do the best I can.    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methylphenidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A day after my diagnosis, I started a course of 16mg, one tablet a day for two weeks and then 36mg for the following month. Had some minor headaches during the first few days and also showed a slightly more dull personality than normal. At work during stressful times I was able to keep a cool head and take in more information and being less distracted by new information that is being thrown at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However I arranged an new appointment after a month of using the 36mg dosage as I was aware I still had some problem areas such as, impulsive behaviour, inattention when being directly spoken to however I showed no side effects from taking the medication. So dosage was increased again, to 54mg once a day. An additional note by my doctor stated that there was a noticeable visual difference in my body language during the appointment to see them. First time they saw me I showed some signs of anxiety but more noticeably, I was fidgeting a lot with my hands while being spoken to. The second appointment was a drastic change in my body language and I was sitting calmly and came across more confident. Which was a good sign of development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 of weeks ago I ended up going for what I thought was my next scheduled appointment but due to me previously having an emergency appointment, my next one was extended a month later. I realised this once I arrived that day. While I was there I was aware I was getting a new order soon so I checked in with them about my progress and I explained that I still have problem areas I need working on. After a while longer they made the decision the increase dosage to 72mg (taking 2x 36mg tablets once a day). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two weeks have passed I would admit I&amp;#39;m finding myself at this current stage more focused on a task I assign myself, which is fantastic if I&amp;#39;m cleaning the house, wanting to work on a project or studying of course. However there are still underlying problems I am still struggling with;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social interaction with groups or individuals. From my understanding, I struggle with keeping track of a conversation as sometimes my mind wonders like when reading a book. I frequently and impulsively say whats on my mind that I would share without really thinking about how it would impact others around me or whether it&amp;#39;s related to the current topic (or related to any topic we&amp;#39;ve talked about). &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Video/board games that involve heavily on strategy, decision making for the best possible outcome seem to always be an overwhelmingly challenging genre for me and I&amp;#39;m always left completely blank of what to do. Played a game of &lt;a href=\"http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/\"&gt;Munchkin&lt;/a&gt; with my friends recently and I was dead stuck and an annoyance to others multiple times when I couldn&amp;#39;t make a decision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Storing short-term tasks in my head is still a problem, for me it&amp;#39;s like I have a bunch of empty speech bubbles above my head. I know they are there but I can&amp;#39;t retrieve them unless I have a visual or audio cue. Taking the medication has shown some improvements in this area of my daily life, however I am still heavily reliant on other methods to help me remember things I need to do.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess overall progress has been good, I will have more scheduled appointments later on so I hope things do continue to get better for me. The real impact on my life seems to be retaining focus on a task I want to do and that I feel very energised from a couple hours after taking the medication.

So sorry if it&amp;#39;s too long, my Vyvanse hasn&amp;#39;t worn off yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, this past summer I got an ADHD-PI diagnosis. I never even considered it a possibility until my therapist brought it up and everything just clicked into place. Semester starts and my new psychiatrist prescribes me Adderall XR 20mg. Not knowing any better I took the full pill on my first day and was basically immobile with anxiety and hyperfocusing like crazy. I was scared to take it again but tried anyway after a couple of days at 10mg and it basically knocked me out and put me to sleep. The NEXT day I took 15 mg and while the brain fog wasn&amp;#39;t really gone, I was actually doing stuff! I had motivation! And the next day, when I tried 20 mg again, it was the best it&amp;#39;s ever been. I felt like the fog had been lifted, my social anxiety was cured, I was participating in class, and if I willed myself to do something I could do it. I wasn&amp;#39;t anxious either, I was calm. It went pretty smoothly for the next three days, though the crashes were awful (anxiety and severe depression). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a week Adderall XR stopped being effective for me. Suddenly the clearheadedness was replaced with anxiety again, and the awful crashes were too much for me to handle and I spiraled into a depressive episode. I felt like my brain had broken somehow. It was when I was taking the Adderall XR not for focusing but to stave off the depression that I decided to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the doctor to put me on Wellbutrin primarily for the depression and somewhat for ADHD (didn&amp;#39;t trust myself on a stimulant but still needed something to get through the semester). I was and still am on Lexapro 10mg which I don&amp;#39;t think is doing anything. PsyDoc thought Wellbutrin would exacerbate anxiety like the Adderall but it actually didn&amp;#39;t at all. Wellbutrin worked for motivation maaaybe the first two days of taking it, and eventually got me out of the depressive pit. Fought through some nasty side effects but none anymore. Works great for depression, does nothing for anxiety and ADHD, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m on Vyvanse along with the Wellbutrin. While there are no awful crashes, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s working properly. Yes I can get things done, but after about 5 hours it loses its effectiveness and some uncontrollable anxiety sets in for the rest of the duration. Lower doses make me fall asleep. Brain fog is still heavy on Vyvanse. There are somehow more side effects than with the Adderall (stomach pain, dizziness, fatigue), but both medications did increase my heart rate. I have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on, isn&amp;#39;t Vyvanse supposed to have less side effects? Could the Wellbutrin be causing this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want to get back to how the Adderall XR was on those first few days. I actually felt present in the moment. Is it even possible to get there again? Do stimulants just not work properly on me? Do I try Adderall IR? Do I try the XR again now that I&amp;#39;m on Wellbutrin? Should I give Concerta or Strattera a chance? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll probably try all of these eventually, I&amp;#39;m just a little discouraged right now and wanted to share my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR Adderall XR cleared the brian fog for the first week but crashes and anxiety became too much, Wellbutrin did nothing for ADHD, and Vyvanse doesn&amp;#39;t clear the brain fog, only lasts 5 hours and has more side effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi there! Just created an account to talk about my experiences with medication since it has been very rough and confusing and I'm not really sure where to go from here. I also want to know if anyone has similar experiences. So sorry if it's too long, my Vyvanse hasn't worn off yet.\n\nSo, this past summer I got an ADHD-PI diagnosis. I never even considered it a possibility until my therapist brought it up and everything just clicked into place. Semester starts and my new psychiatrist prescribes me Adderall XR 20mg. Not knowing any better I took the full pill on my first day and was basically immobile with anxiety and hyperfocusing like crazy. I was scared to take it again but tried anyway after a couple of days at 10mg and it basically knocked me out and put me to sleep. The NEXT day I took 15 mg and while the brain fog wasn't really gone, I was actually doing stuff! I had motivation! And the next day, when I tried 20 mg again, it was the best it's ever been. I felt like the fog had been lifted, my social anxiety was cured, I was participating in class, and if I willed myself to do something I could do it. I wasn't anxious either, I was calm.

It should help lighten the load we bear with ADHD, allowing us to focus on getting things done instead of whatever else is on our mind.  One of the big things that I found, was there is many productivity apps that seem over the top and try to micromanage, such as habit tracking apps.  I personally get overwhelmed by those apps as they require a lot of attention and updating, and I feel trying to remember to do that is a big waste of energy when I&amp;#39;m trying to remember my important to-do&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I currently use is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://keep.google.com\"&gt;Google Keep&lt;/a&gt; - This app changed it all for me.  It allows you to save websites (has browser extension), pictures and voice recordings (both which can turn into text), make drawings/doodles, and make to-do lists.  I moved all of my non-regular bookmarks into here for later viewing.  I save websites and write down/record ideas that I don&amp;#39;t need to be distracted by in the present moment. It really helps clear my mind.  I also keep some daily routine/reminder notes pinned to the top for quick glance and a general grocery list that I can check/uncheck.  It has labels and color coding, but I think Wunderlist does a much better job of organizing to-do&amp;#39;s.  Another app similar to this is Mozilla&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https://getpocket.com/\"&gt;pocket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bulletjournal.com/\"&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt; - I use this for daily to-do&amp;#39;s.

I prefer these ones because they allow you to make different block lists and set schedules for when to block which list.  They both have free versions but have better paid options.

I'm going to get a bad grade because I haven't been able to look at it and all the stuff on the project explanation just looks like a bunch of random words strung together.

I can't give up on getting a degree because then I would have wasted all my parents' money for nothing, and I'm a stubborn girl who doesn't want to lose at anything. I'm just terrified that eventually my parents will get tired of my roller coaster and give up on me. Maybe I'd be better off quitting my anti-depressants and being motivated by OCD again. :p At least I'd get stuff done. I just don't believe I can ever actually do well at anything.

I went to a demanding school that placed a lot of importance on grades and had the same expectation from my parents, so my self esteem was linked to my academic performance. During the last two years of school I studied the International Baccalaureate, which is an incredibly demanding programme that basically resulted in every student under it becoming a mindless numbed out zombie. The less said about that, the better, as I have strong opinions about the suffering my friends and I went through, but I digress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I was exhausted during the IB but so was everyone else around me. I scored well and started uni, then noticed that I was still exhausted even though my workload was considerably lighter than at school and I was getting more sleep. At my uni (I&amp;#39;m in the UK), you needed a diagnosis to get any real support so I pushed for a diagnosis and was eventually diagnosed with CFS/ME during my first year of uni. Since then I&amp;#39;ve had a bunch of different tests (Vitamin B, thyroid, iron, sleep study, etc) that have always come back normal. I managed to complete my undergrad but I started a Masters degree right after and had to drop out halfway. Since then (two years ago) I&amp;#39;ve been unable to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the interesting bit: The main reason I was able to complete my undergrad was because I was put on modafinil (provigil). It&amp;#39;s a medication that promotes wakefulness. it also is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and commonly used as a study drug. When I started my Master&amp;#39;s, due to the way NHS funding is region-localised they couldn&amp;#39;t continue me on Modafinil and it was shortly after I was taken off it that I was forced to drop out. I&amp;#39;ve recently been put back on it (about six months ago) and it has once again improved my life although not enough to address all my fatigue. (If it&amp;#39;s relevant I haven&amp;#39;t changed my dose at all since I began it.) When I&amp;#39;m on it I feel more alert and awake, although not to the extent of a &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been constantly bothered by my CFS diagnosis as I didn&amp;#39;t think it captured the entire &amp;#39;picture&amp;#39; of my health. My tiredness feels centred around my head and my eyes, not my body. Since the big drop in my health (when I dropped out of my masters) I find it incredibly difficult to concentrate or to read anything advanced. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to motivate myself to work from home so I can take it at my own pace but I find it difficult to discipline myself as I always thrived off external pressure. I am also constantly bored and frustrated. I&amp;#39;ve compared myself to a border collie locked in a house all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had trouble with the benefits system because I appear to be a charismatic and intelligent person and they cant fathom that I have concentration issues.

Or does the fact I&amp;#39;m on a dopamine reuptake inhibitor already mean that any adhd should be treated already?

I have no concrete diagnosis yet but everything is pointing to it and my psych eval had an IQ profile that was described to me as being very typical of ADHD. I went through a gambit of Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta and then got off the latter in an attempt to figure out if I could do without some bruxism I was experiencing. That didn&amp;#39;t go well at all. So several months later I&amp;#39;m back and trying out the Strattera that my friends with ADHD practically worship. My ADHD symptoms may be worsening, I&amp;#39;m not sure. But I have had more instances lately of just zoning out entirely at work, as a cashier, almost handing customers back their full payment as change and other fun things. But.

I have no concrete diagnosis yet but everything is pointing to it and my psych eval had an IQ profile that was described to me as being very typical of ADHD. I went through a gambit of Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta and then got off the latter in an attempt to figure out if I could do without some bruxism I was experiencing. That didn't go well at all. So several months later I'm back and trying out the Strattera that my friends with ADHD practically worship. My ADHD symptoms may be worsening, I'm not sure.

The appointment letter didn't explain anything other than confirm the appointment date and time. \n\nI'm in the process of being performance managed at work due to my forgetfulness, inattentiveness to details, poor organisational and time management skills. I've been told I'm inconsistent, I have great days and catastrophic days   I'm currently receiving coaching to improve.  Despite being a hard worker hasn't been the first time. \n\nSome background about me. \n\n- Female, 34 years old tomorrow. \n\n- My thinking is foggy most of the time, I never feel like I'm alert or on the ball. Recalling information on the spot can be a struggle but I can recall useless information in great detail from 20 years ago.\n\n- I was performance managed in a job in 2014\n\n- I've been passed over for salary increases and promotion \n\n- I've never been fired but twice a temporary contract was not extended because of my time keeping, repetitive mistakes \n \n- my concentration wanes in meetings at work, after 15 mins I'm gone (I hate those 2 hour company updates!)\n\n- tasks and projects are always at various stages of completion at work (and at home).  I have a tendency to jump from task to task to task.  \n\n- put things off until they're at a critical point or a state of emergency because I get extreme anxiety to start.  It's a miracle I managed to get through university! \n\n- told I was \"bright\", \"had potential\", \"easily distracted\", \"poor concentration\".  Sometimes I struggled at school in certains subjects like Biology but found subjects like Art, Music, easy but I was deterred by my parents from pursuing them but they're huge interests to this day\n\n- Sometimes it can take me a day or two to finish watching a film because I pause it and go off to do something online or round the house \n\n- I can't remember the last time I sat down to enjoy a book without putting it down after a few pages because the words won't sink in. \n\n- I hate engaging in back and forth text messages as I get bored.  And lengthy telephone calls are annoying and I tend to zone out after about 10-15 minutes \n\n- sometimes I can become fixated on hobbies and subjects (obsessed even?) but then I loose interest and move on to the next thing.  I know a little about a lot, especially music!  But I can become focused on photography then it shifts to working out and being healthy. \n\n- If I didn't have a message board to tack letters on to I'd forget my appointments, or if I didn't have a fixed place to keep my keys and wallet I'd lose them all the time. \n\n- I'm pretty impulsive... especially when it comes to buying things. Spontaneous, if an idea pops into my head I run with it.  Action first, deal with consequences later.   I'm rubbish with money. \n\n- When I'm talking to friends, family, colleagues, I have a bad habit of launching into a conversation causing people to say \"what are you on about\" so I have to go back and start again because I missed the first part.  When someone's telling me something my mind is thinking of questions and I ask them before they've had a chance to finish what they're saying.  It's either that or I'm not listening at all.  \n\nI plan on taking the following to my appointments \n\n- School reports from 5-16 years old (thanks for keeping those, mum!)\n- my performance management write ups from my line manager from our weekly meetings (I have about 10 weeks worth)\n- evidence of where I have made errors (emails, letters, data input etc) \n\nTLTR - I have an assessment on 21 December (NHS Scotland).  What can I expect to happen at my appointment? tests? discussion? I'm nervous!

Basically, it&amp;#39;s a book saying that if you live in a messy/cluttered place, you&amp;#39;ll have trouble being at peace/happy. \nThe book is well written (at least it was in French), it can be a bit weird sometimes (her way to deal with objets/clothes), but it gave me the motivation to start declutter.\nI still remember while doing it, and once I was done: it felt amazing. And I was really surprised: she mentions in the book that she sometimes has an incredible amount of trash bags full of useless stuff when she cleans a house, but I had no idea it would be the same for me. At the time, I was leaving with my mother, but even in my bedroom, I had an insane amount of things to throw/give away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the first time I read about the benefits of decluterring, especially with ADHD brains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) At the beginning of the year, I read Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism by Fumio Sasaki. I wasn&amp;#39;t really into this whole minimalism thing, for me, it was more a trend on Instagram, where you post clean and simple picture of your quinoa. Anyway, I got more and more interested into the thing, to a point where I decided to try. I realized that by giving up on a lot of things, and stop buying useless things (I was addicted to buying crap on Amazon just for the thrill of waiting the delivery guy), my life became easier. I don&amp;#39;t think it has to be as extreme as the author who has almost no possession, but I think that adopting this mindset helped me deal with clutter, and the impulsive need of buying random crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I moved in to my own place in April this year. The first 2 months were great, the place wasn&amp;#39;t cluttered at all, I did my best to bring only the essential. It was almost relaxing to sit down and look around (which is usually not relaxing at all for my ADHD). But recently, I realized that it has became a mess. Of course, it&amp;#39;s not a disaster, some people may even call my place normal, but for me it&amp;#39;s a mess. It seems like everywhere I look, I find something that I want to play with/put somewhere else. I think a lot has to do with the fact that it&amp;#39;s full of crap again. I decided today to fully clean and reorder my bathroom. I thought it would take me 20-30mn max.

Basically, it's a book saying that if you live in a messy/cluttered place, you'll have trouble being at peace/happy. \nThe book is well written (at least it was in French), it can be a bit weird sometimes (her way to deal with objets/clothes), but it gave me the motivation to start declutter.\nI still remember while doing it, and once I was done: it felt amazing. And I was really surprised: she mentions in the book that she sometimes has an incredible amount of trash bags full of useless stuff when she cleans a house, but I had no idea it would be the same for me. At the time, I was leaving with my mother, but even in my bedroom, I had an insane amount of things to throw/give away.\n\nIt's not the first time I read about the benefits of decluterring, especially with ADHD brains.\n\n2) At the beginning of the year, I read Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism by Fumio Sasaki. I wasn't really into this whole minimalism thing, for me, it was more a trend on Instagram, where you post clean and simple picture of your quinoa. Anyway, I got more and more interested into the thing, to a point where I decided to try. I realized that by giving up on a lot of things, and stop buying useless things (I was addicted to buying crap on Amazon just for the thrill of waiting the delivery guy), my life became easier. I don't think it has to be as extreme as the author who has almost no possession, but I think that adopting this mindset helped me deal with clutter, and the impulsive need of buying random crap.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I moved in to my own place in April this year. The first 2 months were great, the place wasn't cluttered at all, I did my best to bring only the essential. It was almost relaxing to sit down and look around (which is usually not relaxing at all for my ADHD). But recently, I realized that it has became a mess. Of course, it's not a disaster, some people may even call my place normal, but for me it's a mess. It seems like everywhere I look, I find something that I want to play with/put somewhere else. I think a lot has to do with the fact that it's full of crap again. I decided today to fully clean and reorder my bathroom. I thought it would take me 20-30mn max. I was wrong.\n\n15mn only to throw everything on the floor of the bathroom (and it's a small bathroom). But it still feels really good, it's like taking off something I don't need from my brain, and throwing it away.\n\nSo, I'll be cleaning/throwing/giving away stuff this weekend, I'm sure it'll help me with my mood and ADHD.\n\nI'm sharing this because I feel that something that helped me this much could help other people. Feel free to try, and let me know how it went!\n\n(English isn't my first language).\n\n**TL;DR: Read a book about decluttering, got rid of most of the stuff I had/didn't use, my mood and ADHD got better.**\n\n\n\n**Edit:** Woah, thanks for the upvotes, I didn't think that would interest anyone.

I started in the beginning with 10mg, then 20mg, 30mg, and all the way to where I am now, and why I am writing this post- 50mg. Now, I&amp;#39;m 17 yo and in Uni, and have been struggling greatly with ADHD. I finally got an official diagnosis (after a year of persuading my parents and 7 hours worth of neuropsych. testing) about a month ago, and received an RX for Adderall. I was quite excited to try the drug because I was hoping for my life to make a 180. Uni has been massively stress-inducing, and though I am not failing, I have received my first D (which only caused more anxiety, depression, and the inevitable plummeting of my self-esteem). The first day I took 10mg, I didn&amp;#39;t notice anything. I am aware that 10mg is a relatively low dosage, but my psych. wanted me to start off on a low dose and gradually climb to a higher dose, if necessary. 20mg- same thing. 30mg- Increased focus for 2 hours, then nothing for the rest of the day. I called my psych and let him know about the situation. I explained that I wasn&amp;#39;t noticing any severe side effects (except for the typical dry throat and suppressed appetite). I went on to 40mg for 3 days, then 50mg for an additional 3. To my surprise... nothing. I have felt no increase in concentration, energy, or mental clarity. I was getting frustrated because, well, finals are approaching and I was hoping that the medication problem would be sorted by now, but I understand how complex the medication phase can be. Anyways, long story short, I mentioned all of this to my psych. The only benefit I received from the drug was a state of slight relaxation. I wasn&amp;#39;t jumping all over the place or feeling jittery on any of the doses. The psych decided to try Ritalin. I&amp;#39;m currently majoring in Chem (will change major next year b/c I&amp;#39;ve come to realize that chem is more of a hobby than a passion (ugh, getting off topic again)), and on my own time, I like to read about drugs, medicine, neurology, etc. My anxiety tends to get pretty bad sometimes, so I was surprised that my pscyh prescribed the Ritalin, considering the anxiety-inducing side effects it has on many users. I wanted to ask him about possibly trying dexadrine or Vyvanse because they are pure dex-amph (ya, I know Vyvanse dex but attached to the amino acid, L-lysine, which is later converted to dex, giving a smooth experience without the anxiety side effect), but I felt like that would cause red flags to pop up all over the place. I didn&amp;#39;t want him to think that I am seeking drugs (I&amp;#39;m sick of living this way and genuinely want to improve my quality of life), so I decided to go ahead and say yes to the Ritalin. At this point, I don&amp;#39;t know what to expect. My psych mentioned that if the Ritalin is deemed ineffective, then we will most likely go onto trying a non-stimulant. I have already been on Strattera and it made me super irritated and lethargic, so while I know there are plenty of other non-stim meds out there, I&amp;#39;m not so optimistic, but you never know. The psych himself is a great guy and wants to help me, so if the Ritalin does not work, I will ask about trying other stimulants (will not mention specifics) and see if he talks about Vyvanse, dex, Focalin (methylphenidate), and so on. I&amp;#39;m ranting because I am upset, tired, and frustrated with who I am. The point of this post is- what should I expect from Ritalin? Is there anyone you or someone you know been in a similar situation (Adderall not working at even high dosages, then switching to Ritalin).

--&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I somehow came upon this reddit post the other day: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/53ka9y/people_talk_a_lot_about_bojack_accurately/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/53ka9y/people_talk_a_lot_about_bojack_accurately/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it really resonated with me. Lately I have been struggling with what I thought was a hint of depression -- feelings of self-loathing, inadequacy, incapability of accomplishing anything, brief suicidal thoughts, etc.. And since I had enjoyed the show recently, the portrayal of Bojack was relatively fresh in my mind. Seeing that interpretation of Bojack&amp;#39;s behavior through the lens of ADD and that poster&amp;#39;s experience resonated more with me than descriptions of depression did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, all through high school and college and even now into my working life, I have struggled so much with focus and at times I didn&amp;#39;t even realize it, since I have always been able to get by and even succeed by many standards. I can&amp;#39;t remember any times where I actually paid attention to a lecture. I have never  successfully taken notes in a class -- and not for lack of trying. One of my roommates and best friends during college and I had were very similar in many respects and he was diagnosed with ADHD his senior year of college -- I figured yeah it makes sense, he is way worse than I am about cutting people off in conversation and leaving dishes out than me -- the former didn&amp;#39;t apply to me (as far as I&amp;#39;m aware). But at the same time, though I didn&amp;#39;t say so, I figured it was primarily a way to get study drugs legally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now I work as a Software Engineer but while in high school I would code during unrelated classes, now I struggle to start a task and spend enough time in a loop of knowing what I should do, determining where I should start, feeling overwhelmed, distracting myself with reddit, and doing it all again that I could have done the task twice-over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In school, I would work best under pressure -- standardized testing I excelled at but I would always save the assignments until the last minute and get them done, but never to my standards. And here at work, I work best in the half-hour leading up to scrum when I know I have to get something done to show. That stand-up meeting though wipes my focus and I&amp;#39;ll be lucky to get in a zone again that day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether it is an assignment for work or for school, it is as though all the subtasks will be floating in my head and fighting for attention-- unformed thoughts that if I give the effort of fleshing out, another immediately demands its place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been the kind of person that can never follow through on a project or idea -- plenty grabs my attention and I consider worth starting but just as quickly all interest is gone and others have taken its place. This was most frustrating when I worked at a company that gave company time for working on personal projects and I would never be able to do anything I could feel proud to share let alone at all. I could find something interesting enough to look into, and an hour later not care whatsoever about it or any applications of it and have some other interest. If I were lucky enough to care about something long enough to start something with it, you can bet by next week I could not care less. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still want to be a software developer and I still think that in those rare times of focus I am good at it but I have been considering that I just shouldn&amp;#39;t be. That I&amp;#39;m stupid and lazy and anyone else would do a better job than me due to my inefficiency.

Just wanted to put it out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I somehow came upon this reddit post the other day: https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/53ka9y/people_talk_a_lot_about_bojack_accurately/\n\nAnd it really resonated with me. Lately I have been struggling with what I thought was a hint of depression -- feelings of self-loathing, inadequacy, incapability of accomplishing anything, brief suicidal thoughts, etc.. And since I had enjoyed the show recently, the portrayal of Bojack was relatively fresh in my mind. Seeing that interpretation of Bojack's behavior through the lens of ADD and that poster's experience resonated more with me than descriptions of depression did. \n\nFurthermore, all through high school and college and even now into my working life, I have struggled so much with focus and at times I didn't even realize it, since I have always been able to get by and even succeed by many standards. I can't remember any times where I actually paid attention to a lecture. I have never  successfully taken notes in a class -- and not for lack of trying. One of my roommates and best friends during college and I had were very similar in many respects and he was diagnosed with ADHD his senior year of college -- I figured yeah it makes sense, he is way worse than I am about cutting people off in conversation and leaving dishes out than me -- the former didn't apply to me (as far as I'm aware). But at the same time, though I didn't say so, I figured it was primarily a way to get study drugs legally. \n\nAnd now I work as a Software Engineer but while in high school I would code during unrelated classes, now I struggle to start a task and spend enough time in a loop of knowing what I should do, determining where I should start, feeling overwhelmed, distracting myself with reddit, and doing it all again that I could have done the task twice-over. \n\nIn school, I would work best under pressure -- standardized testing I excelled at but I would always save the assignments until the last minute and get them done, but never to my standards. And here at work, I work best in the half-hour leading up to scrum when I know I have to get something done to show. That stand-up meeting though wipes my focus and I'll be lucky to get in a zone again that day. \n\nWhether it is an assignment for work or for school, it is as though all the subtasks will be floating in my head and fighting for attention-- unformed thoughts that if I give the effort of fleshing out, another immediately demands its place.\n\nI've always been the kind of person that can never follow through on a project or idea -- plenty grabs my attention and I consider worth starting but just as quickly all interest is gone and others have taken its place. This was most frustrating when I worked at a company that gave company time for working on personal projects and I would never be able to do anything I could feel proud to share let alone at all. I could find something interesting enough to look into, and an hour later not care whatsoever about it or any applications of it and have some other interest. If I were lucky enough to care about something long enough to start something with it, you can bet by next week I could not care less. \n\nI still want to be a software developer and I still think that in those rare times of focus I am good at it but I have been considering that I just shouldn't be. That I'm stupid and lazy and anyone else would do a better job than me due to my inefficiency. But coming upon the idea that maybe ADHD could explain some of this and that it can be fixed gives me some hope. \n\nI filled out the self-evaluation with the 6 questions and satisfied 6/6 for being indicative of potential ADHD. So I booked a consultation with a Family Doctor (Specialist required a referral).\n\nYet I'm still wondering: is even considering ADHD as an explanation for my behavior and how I've been feeling just a convenient excuse? \n\nPlease forgive me if that was hard to follow; the box for posting is rather small to see the scope of what I've written and this was pretty stream-of-consciousness.

I see someone doing something interested and immediately think how awesome it would be to be the same person and how happy this will make me. I always put huge expectations on stuff and am always left a bit dissapointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I currently have so many fights what to do when I come home and have some freetime. Here&amp;#39;s a list of the things I can decide to do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play Guitar&lt;/strong&gt;: Picked this up this year. Have been playing trumpet as a little child and always been musically addicted. However I can not often bring myself to do basic exercises. I just start to play some songs/chords and get frustrated that I am not far enough to play everything cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movies&lt;/strong&gt;: I love movies honestly. Especially slow told indie ones, where there&amp;#39;s beautiful music, beautiful images and just have an artistic vibe to it. I don&amp;#39;t know if I really enjoy the art behind it or just saying to myself &amp;quot;This movie is better than the rest, because it&amp;#39;s artsy and different&amp;quot;. And I have a weird sensation I again had yesterday. I lie in my bed and turned on Spiderman Homecoming. I thought would be fun watching it. After 20 minutes my neck kind of tensed up and I got a kind of depressed and overwhelmed feeling. I sometimes have this and it kills me. This is not happening when I watch a movie with my GF. Though I am there sometimes also tense, because I always hope she likes it also and fear she might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Games&lt;/strong&gt; : What I love are titles like CS:GO or PUBG. Not much too pay attention to. I already know the controls and mechanics. And I can just have fun adventures with my friends. But what I also enjoy are Singleplayer games. Played Fallout 3 and absolutely loved it (Not at the beginning though, it was hard to get into). Now I started Horizon Zero Dawn. What I always notice with Singleplayer games is that I have a hard time getting into. I also tense up a bit like watching some movies, and I have trouble following the story. Sometimes also the game mechanic itself  is too overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I notice after I have watched a movie or a game and watch the Trailer again or some scenes, how much I have enjoyed it and the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books&lt;/strong&gt;: As a child i was reading so much, due to the fact I had no PC and no TV. But what I noticed I also did it a lot to look like a smart person. I liked being told how well read I am and I still have it in me, when I read a book. The knowing of telling people what interesting and artsy books I have read. But I don&amp;#39;t want that being the reason, I want to enjoy the book. Being in a completely different world, I know that feeling. But it&amp;#39;s hard to get into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming&lt;/strong&gt;: I am a Software Dev and I love tech always have found it fascinating. So you would guess I do much at home, but I currently don&amp;#39;t. I see people doing cool projects at home and I think to myself I want that, too. But I can&amp;#39;t really start a project and always procrastinate. And this is also a problem. I sit at work, have trouble focusing and browse the web for new things I can do when I come home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography&lt;/strong&gt;: Always have been creative and loved good images. So a month ago I thought &amp;quot;Ok I buy a DSLR and will become such a good Photographer and everyone will think what a cool person I will be making such interesting photos.&amp;quot;. But till now I have barely used it, because of time, or not wanting to walk around like a creep with a big fat camera around my neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports&lt;/strong&gt;: Now this is quite an easy one. I go to the gym 2 times at least a week and play soccer once a week with my friends. I love the feeling after being completely calm and relaxed. But it always eats up time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I now it may have been a bit too long, but to sum it up I am getting really frustrated. I get home, now I have like 2-3 hours to do something, and force myself to get the best feeling possible out of this time. But I can&amp;#39;t really decide on what to do, what movie to watch, what game to play, what book to read. It feelds so overwhelming to decide on something and to stick with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end I mostly zip through Youtube, because there all my interests are bundled together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny instead of playing guitar, watching a good movie, reading a book, playing a game, going out and doing photographs, I watch other people doing that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watch Lets Plays, Guitar Tutorials, Photography VLogs, People talking about movies or books. And I again daydream about watching a good movie, playing a nice game, doing some cool photography and comfort myself with these thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So my question: How do you deal with that? How do you stop yourself from dreaming about hobbies and actually enjoy them. I put so much pressure on my hobbies that I need to enjoy them, that every time I seem to fail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Troubles deciding what to do in the evening, can&amp;#39;t enjoy anything anymore.

It&amp;#39;s could be a reference book not made to be read for extended periods. I almost feel like I repeated reason 1 but I think this is referencing books I got knowing they were dense and not ADHD friendly, it&amp;#39;s almost like there should be an ADHD rating on books for how enjoyable they are if you have a strong case of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok there&amp;#39;s probably a lot more reasons I posted a few of mine please share yours.

Also there&amp;#39;s a lot more dusting the more books you have/cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I don&amp;#39;t have any meds because my insurance is like requiring a prior auth and all the psychiatrists were trying to explain their way out of it as being too much paperwork documenting all my prior meds I&amp;#39;ve taken and why they should cover it. So if you have any strategies for reading when you don&amp;#39;t have the opportunity to take meds that increase your focus currently (I&amp;#39;m trying to see a new doc for a prior auth so I can get meds) , I often turn on the bath water and let it fill really slowly while I read that&amp;#39;s the only strategy that works for me currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And bottom line and why I posted here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I keep buying books and reading one chapter, I&amp;#39;m thinking about just giving all the other books away and just trying to force myself to keep one book.

It's a fiction book and somehow I'm not connecting with it, like it's classical literature the way the language is written or the person who wrote it has a different reader in mind but yet the way it's written you slightly enjoy it. \n\n 3. My ADHD mind doesn't get a subject and deep down wants to but the material itself is really dry and you feel like you need to get more in depth with it by reading more such as a nutritional or exercise book or maybe something on how the brain works/psychology. It's could be a reference book not made to be read for extended periods. I almost feel like I repeated reason 1 but I think this is referencing books I got knowing they were dense and not ADHD friendly, it's almost like there should be an ADHD rating on books for how enjoyable they are if you have a strong case of ADHD.\n\nOk there's probably a lot more reasons I posted a few of mine please share yours. I need to consider other issues I might be facing here. Also there's a lot more dusting the more books you have/cleaning.\n\nAlso I don't have any meds because my insurance is like requiring a prior auth and all the psychiatrists were trying to explain their way out of it as being too much paperwork documenting all my prior meds I've taken and why they should cover it. So if you have any strategies for reading when you don't have the opportunity to take meds that increase your focus currently (I'm trying to see a new doc for a prior auth so I can get meds) , I often turn on the bath water and let it fill really slowly while I read that's the only strategy that works for me currently.\n\nAnd bottom line and why I posted here:\n\nTL;DR I keep buying books and reading one chapter, I'm thinking about just giving all the other books away and just trying to force myself to keep one book. Has anyone else tried that? Suggestions tips for ADHDers and reading thanks.\n\n ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gu6xe", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Book or Bookshelf?

I\u2019ll take my meds during the day and be able to get through work (mostly) like is expected of me. But then when my meds wear off at around 4pm I feel insane.

I\u2019m sick of having no idea what fun looks like because I\u2019m unable to do something long enough to actually enjoy it. I hate that my brain lights up like a firecracker when I\u2019m trying to sleep and that my person who loves me isn\u2019t able to keep up or make sense of where the heck my head is at. I\u2019m sick of not knowing where my head is at and overwhelming everyone close to me by blurting out things with no context or reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can\u2019t seem to accept the fact that my brain is always going to be like this, and that medication is helpful but it\u2019s not a fix.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hurts to look at my therapist and feel like she is getting overwhelmed just by being around me and trying to make sense of my head. To know that the strategies she gave me were given with best intentions, and to predict the outcome of my attempts to implement them in my life and know that I\u2019ll fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The session is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I\u2019ve confused myself more by attempting to make sense of the way I am. Every \u201cmmm hmm\u201d she made in a response to my illogical rambling felt like it hurt more each time. \nI want to be a better person, to be dependable to my fianc\u00e9, to remember my friend\u2019s birthdays, and to be able to think clearly without being flooded by a million things that don\u2019t ever ask to enter my thoughts.

I hate that my brain lights up like a firecracker when I\u2019m trying to sleep and that my person who loves me isn\u2019t able to keep up or make sense of where the heck my head is at. I\u2019m sick of not knowing where my head is at and overwhelming everyone close to me by blurting out things with no context or reason.\n\n**I can\u2019t seem to accept the fact that my brain is always going to be like this, and that medication is helpful but it\u2019s not a fix.**\n\nIt hurts to look at my therapist and feel like she is getting overwhelmed just by being around me and trying to make sense of my head. To know that the strategies she gave me were given with best intentions, and to predict the outcome of my attempts to implement them in my life and know that I\u2019ll fail.\n\n\nThe session is over.\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve confused myself more by attempting to make sense of the way I am. Every \u201cmmm hmm\u201d she made in a response to my illogical rambling felt like it hurt more each time. \nI want to be a better person, to be dependable to my fianc\u00e9, to remember my friend\u2019s birthdays, and to be able to think clearly without being flooded by a million things that don\u2019t ever ask to enter my thoughts. But it feels like my brain is divided into medicated/un-medicated and that those divisions are constantly at war!\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what I need, or how I feel.\n\n\nBut this has made me feel better than my therapy session did. Which is frustrating because I don\u2019t want to host my own pity party.\nAnyway, I\u2019m done now.\n\n\n***TLDR; Went to a therapist, walked out feeling like shit. Struggling to find solitude within myself.***\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gsg0j", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I can't find my rhyme or reason.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512101834.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gsg0j", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/7gsg0j/i_cant_find_my_rhyme_or_reason/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512129958.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7gsg0j/i_cant_find_my_rhyme_or_reason/", "author_flair_text": "ADHD-C", "quarantine": false, "author": "squatsforlife", "created_utc": 1512101158.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.ADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "ADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a great memory.

I feel like no one else takes ADHD medication side effects seriously except those who have it. I normally take long release Focalin every morning, and despite a few minor side effects, it works really well for me. I also have a short release medication that I take occasionally after school if I need it to get through homework that night. However, I usually avoid this medication because it makes me angry and gives me bad cotton mouth. I thought that this medication was some kind of short release Focalin, and that I was having side effects because I had already taken a higher dosage that may have not completely worn off. \n\nToday, I took the short release knowing that I have a ton of homework to do and would be getting home from school late. I am currently having the worst emotional side effects I've ever had- for five minutes I'm crying, and then the next five I'm in a blinding rage. I told my mom about what I was feeling (I was recently diagnosed as a teenager, so I can fully comprehend and calmly express how I feel), and that's when I found out that the short release wasn't Focalin, I actually took Ritalin. Now she's mad at me because I got mad at her for not telling me what I'm putting in my body. Is it so wrong for me to be upset? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Do I just keep having to up the dosage non stop, does it ever level out? **I really don't have time to waste, ** getting a doctors appointment in the UK takes months so I can only ask my doctor for one thing every month. I have assignents due and my brain not shutting the fuck up is really hindering my ability to do them well, let alone at all.\n\nAny advice?

After researching for a while I discovered many people have attempted doing this, with the most common method being combining vyvanse powder with trypsin, but I have also read that this method is ineffective and doesn&amp;#39;t work. I read an in depth article written by David W.

I get nothing new or remotely interesting out of it, and they just get agitated before going back to their willful ignorance.\n\nThat being said, when I go through say college where I technically don't need to go to class to learn the stuff any better or faster than sitting at home. My problem is how to write essays because I have more ideas that I end up having trouble chopping down and still assignment requirements. I've gone to a lot of the \"departments\" that are supposed to specialize in certain aids, but most are just a \"front\" to make it look like the uni has resources.. Everyone in them is just spitting out derivative self-help bullshit. **Now my entire life has just become this huuuuge unnecessary King Tommy from Rick &amp; Morty kinda slow reveal that I always have to wait until completion** by which I've either stopped caring or I've come to the conclusion that the person using this shtick as a default strategy is just distracting from the fact that they don't know anything. **My life is just a shit video game where developers didn't think to add a \"skip cutscene\" feature.**\n\nI currently have a friend on campus who's on a diff course program and we both bounce ideas off each other and it's seemed to work out much better in helping each of us refine ideas. But we both live really far away, and it just seems like everyone else I can do this with either thinks \"why bother, why do you want a higher grade (higher grade = not explicitly failing to them), why do you care, or you're on touching on topics I don't even know how to pronounce even though we're halfway through the academic year).\n\nI understand that I can come off as a bit intense, but it's only because I don't think mediocrity is anything worth celebrating; especially given the stakes and costs of an education. Like yeah everyone is there because society needs it, but I do not agree with this reformation of the college experience that is now being marketed and sold as the most expensive 4 year extension of adolescence.

I've basically given up my free will my entire life for the sake of getting things done, because I only had the mental resources to think about one thing and considering \"what do *I* really want\" was just not mentally possible while also remaining any kind of productive.\n\nHas anyone else felt this?  Even if you haven't felt anger, have there been times that you suddenly realize something that you couldn't have even seen before getting treatment?  I'm looking for any ideas at all here.  My psychiatrist first thought that I may be irritable due to the medication, and that's likely true.  He also thought that I may just be becoming more assertive for myself, which is also likely true.  But all that doesn't mean that I also haven't been consistently taken advantage of.  It's not like I knew about these things but chose to be ok with them before.  It's not like I realized what was up but was too shy to mention it.  I truly and honestly could not see what was going on, and now that I actually have the ability to do so it's really hard to handle emotionally.\n\nTL;DR  I feel that treatment for ADHD has given me the new ability to see how badly I am sometimes being treated by others.  Does this make any sense?  How do I handle this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gdymg", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I'm experiencing a lot of anger about how I've let myself be taken advantage of by others at a time when I was too overwhelmed to notice.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 40, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 23, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gdymg", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/7gdymg/im_experiencing_a_lot_of_anger_about_how_ive_let/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511997388.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7gdymg/im_experiencing_a_lot_of_anger_about_how_ive_let/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "stilldebugging", "created_utc": 1511968588.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 40}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.ADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "ADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a study (&lt;a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00038/full\"&gt;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00038/full&lt;/a&gt;) that looked into the effects of Adderall on the developing adolescent brain.

My other post is literally just me asking for good luck so it's really not necessary to check out but I linked it anyways just in case. But! I wanted to talk about how my first day on generic Adderall went.\n\nI'm only on a low dose for now since I am just starting out. 10mg. I have inattentive type ADHD (idk if this is the proper terminology or not, sorry!)\n\nSo... it felt like I was a normal person for once instead of feeling like a mess. My thoughts weren't jumbled.

I&amp;#39;m writing this right now when I should be writing a paper which is 2 weeks overdue; funnily enough, the paper is on the neurobiological mechanisms of ADHD. Unfortunately, I can&amp;#39;t seem to think properly anymore, or bring myself to work on anything. I&amp;#39;m interested in my course of study, but I find it very difficult to motivate myself to do anything related to it, or maintain motivation during the task itself. While working, I find myself losing track of my thoughts in the middle of sentences while reading papers, and when writing or trying to plan essays, I can&amp;#39;t hold information in my head long enough to structure it in any sort of logical fashion. I get into thought loops where I over-think basic aspects of how to word things or small details of the conceptual structure of my arguments. Basically, I&amp;#39;m on the verge of not being able to function academically at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this basically sounds like my ADHD medicine isn&amp;#39;t working properly and the dosage needs to be adjusted or I need to switch to different meds but I&amp;#39;ve been doing that for the past three years, and things aren&amp;#39;t getting better. The meds do help a bit but less and less with time. I switched to vyvance from concerta 2 years ago because the ritalin was giving me terrible social anxiety and basically ruined my social life all through high school as a result, and this year I switched to a combination of intuniv and instant release dexamphatmine because I don&amp;#39;t like the way stimulants make me feel so I wanted to be able to take the least amount possible and not have it be in my system the entire day if possible. The intuniv helps with general conscientiousness and regulating cognitive and emotional impulsiveness (it&amp;#39;s kind of subtle but really helpful), but the dexamphetamine has slowly decreased in effectiveness over time, and taking breaks or upping the dosage doesn&amp;#39;t really help. I don&amp;#39;t know what other things to try, though I&amp;#39;m going to see my psychiatrist in January again. Though that will be too late for midterms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a bunch of health problems, such as osteoarthritis and hypothyroidism and a terrible immune system from when I had leukaemia as a teenager (though these health problems are pretty well managed at the moment, and I&amp;#39;m not really prevented from engaging in most activities except for anything that involves high pressure impacts on my knees), along with insomnia (which I&amp;#39;ve had since I was a kid) which increases in severity in proportion to the amount of stress I&amp;#39;m under, which makes things a lot harder, because the physical health conditions usually mean I end up behind on work, which makes me stressed, which gives me insomnia, and the resulting mixture of sleep deprivation and stress usually makes my ADHD several times worse, and which can cause a feedback loop with my physical health where everything spirals out of control. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been a consistent problem throughout most of university, and while my physical health is a lot better than it used to be, my ability to think clearly and work consistently has been getting worse. Or at least it seems so to me.  Even when I&amp;#39;m writing this post I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what to say because the issue is so complicated that I can&amp;#39;t think of a way to describe things in such that all of the relevant aspects of my situation are clear. I used to be able to knock out a 2000 word research paper in 5 days including research, but now I have a hard time writing 1500 words over 2 weeks. Maybe this is because my insomnia has been getting worse recently and it&amp;#39;s exacerbating my ADHD but I don&amp;#39;t know; I&amp;#39;ve slept fine for the past couple days but I&amp;#39;m still having a really hard time thinking or bringing myself to do anything. I know that I&amp;#39;m in serious trouble at the moment academically but I just sort of feel detached.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m depressed, since I&amp;#39;m pretty happy to be alive and I savour a lot of things about just looking at trees and birds and being able to experience the beauty of the world when I&amp;#39;m walking to class or when I&amp;#39;m outside in general. I get in very dark moods occasionally, for a couple of hours or days at time maybe a few times a month, since I was a kid, where I legitimately wish I was dead and sit for hours crying silently staring at nothing, but my psychiatrist said I don&amp;#39;t meet the criteria for bipolar disorder or depression. It&amp;#39;s usually after I&amp;#39;ve been sick or I&amp;#39;ve been really stressed. I don&amp;#39;t really know what that&amp;#39;s about, and none of the doctors I&amp;#39;ve asked have been able to tell me. They can&amp;#39;t help with the insomnia either, since the only thing that helps is stuff like zopiclone or amibien, and they don&amp;#39;t prescribe that regularly over here in the UK, and it isn&amp;#39;t a long term solution anyway. I already practice pretty good sleep hygiene, the usual things like no artificial lights for 1-2 hours before sleeping, get up and have a warm shower if you can&amp;#39;t sleep after an hour, don&amp;#39;t nap during the day and don&amp;#39;t eat large meals before bed, go to sleep at the same time every night wake up same time every morning etc. though of course the last two fall apart when I&amp;#39;m stressed because I inevitably stay up later than I should trying to work. Though I&amp;#39;ve been getting better at forcing myself to stop trying to work after a certain point to avoid feedback loops. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway I&amp;#39;m just really tired of not being able to do the things I&amp;#39;m supposed to and want to be able to do. I procrastinate all the time and I rationalise it as just being for five minutes but it ends up being an hour or longer more often than not. I&amp;#39;ve tried using web blockers and stuff but it doesn&amp;#39;t work because ultimately the behaviour is motivated by the fact that I find trying to study viscerally unpleasant and frustrating, and the procrastination is just an avoidance mechanism. I just can&amp;#39;t get in the flow of it anymore. I desperately want to be able to contribute something positive to the world but I don&amp;#39;t really see that happening in my current condition, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to go about doing something about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADHD might be getting worse over time, seriously negatively my life academically, maybe exacerbated by combination of insomnia and possibly ineffective ADHD medication amongst other things.

They can't help with the insomnia either, since the only thing that helps is stuff like zopiclone or amibien, and they don't prescribe that regularly over here in the UK, and it isn't a long term solution anyway. I already practice pretty good sleep hygiene, the usual things like no artificial lights for 1-2 hours before sleeping, get up and have a warm shower if you can't sleep after an hour, don't nap during the day and don't eat large meals before bed, go to sleep at the same time every night wake up same time every morning etc. though of course the last two fall apart when I'm stressed because I inevitably stay up later than I should trying to work. Though I've been getting better at forcing myself to stop trying to work after a certain point to avoid feedback loops. \n\n\nAnyway I'm just really tired of not being able to do the things I'm supposed to and want to be able to do. I procrastinate all the time and I rationalise it as just being for five minutes but it ends up being an hour or longer more often than not. I've tried using web blockers and stuff but it doesn't work because ultimately the behaviour is motivated by the fact that I find trying to study viscerally unpleasant and frustrating, and the procrastination is just an avoidance mechanism. I just can't get in the flow of it anymore. I desperately want to be able to contribute something positive to the world but I don't really see that happening in my current condition, and I don't know how to go about doing something about it. \n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**ADHD might be getting worse over time, seriously negatively my life academically, maybe exacerbated by combination of insomnia and possibly ineffective ADHD medication amongst other things.

I'm pulling a blank. I don't know what my goal should be.. so I was wondering if anyone here has any goals or ideas that they'd be willing to share. Maybe it will give me some inspiration.

I feel that I am at a point in my life where I need to get a handle on my ADD, as I would like to finish my degree and hopefully move up at my work, and I am hitting the brick wall of focus and motivation. I barely made it through my last round of classes, and I find myself losing focus during larger projects at work, and my normal coping mechanisms and tricks are not working. \n\nI'm looking to possibly try medication again, but as I am now pushing 40, is it really worth it to start now? Have any of you started medication late in life?\n\nI am relatively healthy, except for being overweight. I have normal blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7g7x8e", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Trying Medication in your 40s for the (mostly) First Time.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7g7x8e", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/7g7x8e/trying_medication_in_your_40s_for_the_mostly/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511935455.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7g7x8e/trying_medication_in_your_40s_for_the_mostly/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "CzarEggbert", "created_utc": 1511906655.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.ADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "ADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First reddit post so heyy!

I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor about lowering my dose because of my huge weight loss but really want to hear from others to know I'm not alone.  \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7g6z5x", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I'm on an emotional rollercoaster because of Vyvanse.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7g6z5x", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/7g6z5x/im_on_an_emotional_rollercoaster_because_of/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511928162.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7g6z5x/im_on_an_emotional_rollercoaster_because_of/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "waiting4tomoro", "created_utc": 1511899362.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.ADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "ADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else who takes Vyvanse feel like throwing up every morning?

Again really did not get upset w/ my GF but just lost it in general. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This type of behavior is part of a pattern I have.  I have a strange habbit of every once in a while just getting very upset and irrationally mad about something, Im never violent and I dont throw things etc., but I just get very upset and flustered and become irrational.  I have tried meditation, and meditation has generally been working GREAT, but sometimes I still have these outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to note that I have these outbursts often times after I have been drinking a little, however each of these times I wouldnt say I was even close to &amp;quot;wasted,&amp;quot; at most I would say that I was above the legal limit for driving but really my level of intoxication is that of a normal person for my age and social group.  I generally try to avoid getting &amp;quot;hungover drunk&amp;quot; and if I am drinking a lot at most I have a half-dozen drinks.  I know that many will say &amp;quot;Stop Drinking&amp;quot; and while if that would ensure no outbursts, I would be all for it.  However, for one, I am a 25yo.  Much of my social life involves casual drinking, for ex: Taking my GF for a night out and a couple beers or some wine is common place and I quite enjoy it.  Also the vast majority of times I do drink casually there is literally not an incident.

Like I heard them but I also didn't hear them. And with reading it's like I read it, but I didn't read it at the same time. This does me no favors when it comes to focusing because its so tedious and requires so much effort. It slows me down during exams, work takes longer and reading scientific papers that would be otherwise intriguing is just a drag. I don't have quite the same issue with graphic novels ironically enough, but then again tiny snippets of text between lots of images is pretty damn easy to process. \n\nDoes anyone know what exactly IS this problem I'm having with reading or have any tips on how I can improve my reading? Even if you linked me to a children's website for reading comprehension I would try it if it would help me.

The first is just 5-page research paper, but single spaced, so that's basically fucking TEN PAGES. The second is a two-part essay. First is just class stuff. Second is your opinion backed by sources. The second is 4-5 doubled spaced so it's good.\n\nI can finish one paper. But two? My heart literally aches.\n\nLook, I, SEBASTIAN, FEELS FUCKING STUPID BECAUSE I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING BEFORE WRITING. FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. So, I need to plan well, organise, then write. But the second paper is two parts, so that's twice, the already fucking long process, of time BEFORE ATTACKING.\n\nBut, got thing is girl is coming at 8am to sit next to me, so that I can get it fucking done.\n\nPlus, I feel fucking bad about my group members from the other class, thinking that I am letting down, *even though* it's not fucking true, because I feel more comfortable with a nice PPT and a presentation.\n\n(FUCK I HATE IT WHEN MY ROOMMATE CHEWS FUCK)\n\n(OMG HES MAKING FUCKING BLURPING SOUNDS)\n\n######ANOTHER POSITIVE NOTE\n\nBefore, now I am really to fucking anxious -- heart feel fucking squeezed -- but before I was very very proud of forcing myself, because I didn't fucking want to, and it was fucking hard, to try to write the fucking paper -- or at least get the fucking obsessive perfectionist AND understanding strategies done beforehand to help ME.\n\nFuck. Heart's jsut fucked. I jsut ugh. fuck.\n\nfuckfcukcufkckcncncknkncnkckncnkknkkughhhh", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7fsp24", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Con-crastinator HEARTS company (2 papers due at 11:30am EST Monday, Nov 27)", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 6, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7fsp24", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/7fsp24/concrastinator_hearts_company_2_papers_due_at/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511787165.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7fsp24/concrastinator_hearts_company_2_papers_due_at/", "author_flair_text": "ADHD-C", "quarantine": false, "author": "confessionboxlate", "created_utc": 1511758365.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.ADHD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "ADHD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s basically foraging and identifying plants that are near my village(identified almost 130 plants currently), plenty of unexplored small forests around here, I think this is perfect hobby for my ADD brain, extremely stimulating, I&amp;#39;ve became obsessed with it.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut for some reason, I just can&amp;#39;t even respond to simple messages to people on Facebook it&amp;#39;s extremely boring, nor I don&amp;#39;t have any plans or desire to meet with people, don&amp;#39;t find it interesting and stimulating enough.

My new job had coworkers. 5 - 7 at a time and was more boring but better paying so I was experiencing boredom which lead to losing focus, walking off to do something else or talking to someone to pass the time which would impede others or my co-workers would think I was being inefficient because they didn&amp;#39;t understand my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My employer is great, they&amp;#39;ve supported me with my ADHD after I told them I had it. They have asked questions and tried to understand it and seem to have a grasp on how I function. They have asked what they could do to make my work easier, adjusted my schedule, adjusted the work I was responsible for to better hold my attention, have allowed me to set up my workspace the way that I prefer and have always been terrific in trying to understand and make my life easier both in and out of work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally had enough of feeling like a burden due to my ADHD because my employers are some of the most terrific people I&amp;#39;ve met and decided to go back on medication. I didn&amp;#39;t tell them about trying medications but I did anyway and went with Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, and Vyvanse. They started making comments about how I was really great today, seemed super focused, good work while not actually understanding that I was trialing different medications with my doctor to see which one worked best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried all of the common drugs and I found that Concerta made me more focused by reducing how much energy I had but I didn&amp;#39;t seem to care and life seemed dull and right around the time I tried it I started making errors I haven&amp;#39;t made before in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went off of it and felt weird for a week or two and then tried Adderall and Vyvanse, both did very similar things the Adderall definitely has a larger impact on my personality than the Vyvanse but the Vyvanse is much more expensive due to the lack of generic versions which means I&amp;#39;d be paying like $600 for it versus $100 for 90/20mg Adderall XR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ritalin was like I remember from a kid, it made me a zombie, really low personality and it made me have literally no appetite for almost the whole day and when it wore off I would eat anything in site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking Adderall has been very beneficial, I am much more efficient, I don&amp;#39;t lose focus and my thought patterns feel clearer after only a week, the downsides seem to be a lack of appetite but much less of a problem when compared to Ritalin and I&amp;#39;m more irritable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After making this decision after months of trialing I had a conversation with my boss and explained my choice and the situation.

I still have the benefits of ADHD, Hyperfocus, unending energy allowing me to work 10 - 13 hours a day without issues and a thought process that tends to be more out of the box in comparison to my co-workers due to all the extra thinking involved all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm treating you guys as a support group because I have no one close enough to me to share this with and its kind of driving me crazy.\n\nI was lucky and worked in a job in which I didn't impede others because I worked by myself and the way I completed my work didn't matter because it all got done and I was viewed as a terrific employee\n\nI switched careers because the company I was working for started treating me poorly. My new job had coworkers. 5 - 7 at a time and was more boring but better paying so I was experiencing boredom which lead to losing focus, walking off to do something else or talking to someone to pass the time which would impede others or my co-workers would think I was being inefficient because they didn't understand my workflow.\n\nMy employer is great, they've supported me with my ADHD after I told them I had it. They have asked questions and tried to understand it and seem to have a grasp on how I function. They have asked what they could do to make my work easier, adjusted my schedule, adjusted the work I was responsible for to better hold my attention, have allowed me to set up my workspace the way that I prefer and have always been terrific in trying to understand and make my life easier both in and out of work. \n\nI finally had enough of feeling like a burden due to my ADHD because my employers are some of the most terrific people I've met and decided to go back on medication. I didn't tell them about trying medications but I did anyway and went with Adderall, Concerta, Ritalin, and Vyvanse. They started making comments about how I was really great today, seemed super focused, good work while not actually understanding that I was trialing different medications with my doctor to see which one worked best.\n\nI tried all of the common drugs and I found that Concerta made me more focused by reducing how much energy I had but I didn't seem to care and life seemed dull and right around the time I tried it I started making errors I haven't made before in my life. \n\nI went off of it and felt weird for a week or two and then tried Adderall and Vyvanse, both did very similar things the Adderall definitely has a larger impact on my personality than the Vyvanse but the Vyvanse is much more expensive due to the lack of generic versions which means I'd be paying like $600 for it versus $100 for 90/20mg Adderall XR.\n\nRitalin was like I remember from a kid, it made me a zombie, really low personality and it made me have literally no appetite for almost the whole day and when it wore off I would eat anything in site.\n\nTaking Adderall has been very beneficial, I am much more efficient, I don't lose focus and my thought patterns feel clearer after only a week, the downsides seem to be a lack of appetite but much less of a problem when compared to Ritalin and I'm more irritable.\n\nAfter making this decision after months of trialing I had a conversation with my boss and explained my choice and the situation. My boss was very supportive, offered any assistance if needed and said that they were willing to do anything else I wanted to try if the medication didn't work for me and I wanted to try anything else. (They are very big into natural/holistic approaches)\n\nSo I feel great about my choice but now I'm hearing comments from people frequently asking if I am okay, asking if I'm upset or angry because I'm not talking as often as I used to or am giving reasonably short responses instead of expanding on what I'd say off of Adderall. \n\nBut I'm not talking as much because for once I am focused creating this burden of having to act like the old person they knew but not wanting to act like that because it caused less than desirable results for our business making me stressed out and annoyed causing me to seem angry. \n\nI've tried explaining it to anyone that asks but most of them just don't get it, think I need to lay off coffee (1 cup in the morning, 1 after lunch) and try moderating how much I talk or lose focus which isn't really an option....

It was quite unexpected actually, my psychiatrist appointment was for something somewhat unrelated but within 3-5 minutes of meeting and talking with me, my Dr. insisted I take a questionnaire which resulted in my doubtless diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a child though I always had some idea that I wasn&amp;#39;t really neurotypical. I was always in the top classes/groups among the highest achieving students... though something just wasn&amp;#39;t quite right. The idea was pretty much cemented in me when I was moved to a gifted class that involved children from a few different schools in the area. These kids were HARD-WIRED to focus and study. Though even there I was excelling and had a pretty solid spot among the top students but I was incomparable to any of the other kids&amp;#39; personalities. Inattentive, lack of focus, no sense of direction (e.g couldn&amp;#39;t settle on a topic 9 weeks, 6 days into a 10-week assignment while the rest of the class had pretty much moved all started work on the next assignment), Incredibly talkative, always found comments in my reports saying things like &amp;quot;A very intelligent boy yet needs to maintain focus in class. Disrupts the class regularly&amp;quot;. I could go on, but it seemed weird that despite consistent outlandish behavior in class, nothing was being done due to what I would imagine was the success I had with my grades. And of course, not being old enough to pick these things up as real issues, I always just thought it was something in my hands that I need to take care of myself. Ironically, it didn&amp;#39;t help that I have a background of really academic people in my family whom also blew it off anytime I suggested I may have something wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, fast forward to about year 11 (I live in New Zealand, I think that&amp;#39;s like 10th grade?) where I&amp;#39;m now sitting exams and tests that require actual time investment and effort... What the fuck? Why can&amp;#39;t I pass these papers? Why am I leaving half of the test papers blank? Why can&amp;#39;t I understand simple topics in these subjects? Now the frustrating thing was, in class I was typically answering questions the teachers asked with 0 hesitation. I was up to date with whatever we were doing and a lot of the time went away and did a vast amount of my own research on the topics, bringing new information for the teacher and I to discuss if I found something particularly interesting that I knew wouldn&amp;#39;t be discussed otherwise. During class however, I could never manage to finish any tasks. My books were chock-full of pages that were half blank. It was ridiculous. I had never felt so held-back in my studies. Even though I hadn&amp;#39;t really changed since I was a child, the effects of my behavior were starting to become more and more consequential. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to mistake laziness for a disorder, I tried to push away any idea of thinking I may have ADHD or something similar. At this point, it was ingrained in me by everybody of any authority that all I&amp;#39;m lacking is focus and I just need to stop being lazy. Didn&amp;#39;t sound unreasonable so I didn&amp;#39;t argue it. But no matter how hard I tried to simply focus on one thing, I never saw any progress. The results all showed the same thing. Remove distractions, begin task, immediately wander off in brain while constantly trying to fight against it and win back your focus. Rinse, repeat. I felt pathetic. Being Middle-Eastern AND having an academic family background meant there was an overwhelming mound of pressure for me to do well in school. Overwhelming. I went into a bout of depression and in the span of 18 months, I went from being the class clown (and eventually head student) who was friendly and jitty with everybody at school to ruining just about every single relationship I had with everybody who knew me. I made stupid and regretful impulsive decisions that still claw at my conscience til today. My attendance at school dropped to about 60% from ~95%. While I was at school I was pretty much sleeping in class without a single care for what was going on. I felt useless. No matter what I wanted to start working on, I would never see past 5 minutes of picking it up. This especially sucked considering my huge sense of interest and curiosity on just about everything. It was a nightmare. The gentle motor I had firing my brain when I was younger had morphed into about 30 monster truck engines running rampant at full speed 24/7 it seemed. The hardest part wasn&amp;#39;t trying to stay sane in the outside world. It was trying to stay sane with what was going between my ears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I managed to finish school relatively unscathed academically. Maintained just enough good relationships with people that I didn&amp;#39;t go completely off the rails (I think they saw something wasn&amp;#39;t right and didn&amp;#39;t want to jump to the conclusion that I was a self-aware asshole). I was barely holding on, but I was holding on. Still, I didn&amp;#39;t want to make the excuse for myself that this was something bigger than me and I was adamant that I could conquer it myself. I have always been that kinda guy who would get something if I really wanted it. How could this be any different? Something I didn&amp;#39;t know about people with ADHD is their baseline dopamine levels are considerably lower than those of neurotypical people. Because of this, we need constant stimuli or instant gratification to feel anything. I won&amp;#39;t get into detail, but due to this symptom, I had a huge addiction problem which was leaking into my personality. It didn&amp;#39;t help that I grew up in an incredibly egotistic and toxic household which rubbed off on me quite a bit. Not a very good mix. And while I knew I had an issue, I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of just how badly it was affecting, not only me, but the people around me. Especially those I thought I loved and cared for (I say thought because my actions proved different to my feelings). About 8 months out of highschool, I was still dealing with this addiction and despite seeing a counselor during and outside of school, I didn&amp;#39;t seem to be making any progress at all. If I had to guess, to me there wasn&amp;#39;t a burning incentive because of my lack of understanding on just how fucked up I had become mentally. Then a person very close to me dropped the bomb on me and spelled it out as clear as day the kind of person I am and what my behavior is really like. How bad I hurt them and others. Where I could end up, etc. It was not a pretty thing to have to bear or come to terms with. They insisted I seek help. After understanding just who I was becoming I decided that I wasn&amp;#39;t going to stand for 2nd opinions from unqualified adults anymore. I took their advice and went to get a referral to see a psychiatrist the very next day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The appointment was earlier this week and within minutes the Dr. diagnosed me with ADHD. I was given 20mg Ritalin to take and... I don&amp;#39;t know what to tell you. When I took that first pill and felt the effects of it, I had a meltdown. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. It felt like there was constant static playing in my head 24/7 all my life and all of a sudden someone turned the radio knob to find the right frequency. I could think. I could think rationally. I could sit still. I could stay quiet. I could breathe. I focused on a task and saw it through to the end in one sitting. I said &amp;quot;What the fuck?&amp;quot; aloud and then immediately started crying. I wept so hard. How had I gone 18 years with all this fucking NOISE in my head. How did I just do that? I was joyous. I was relieved. There was an answer finally. I spent an easy 2 hours sitting at the edge of my bed absolutely bawling my eyes out. I had never been swept with such overwhelming happiness and relief. It was unforgettable. For once I didn&amp;#39;t feel so pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has been a couple days now but I still haven&amp;#39;t taken it in fully. Off medication my mind is now going back and forth clashing between feelings of relief vs annoyance. I am incredibly guilty of living in the past and feeling bad for things that I can&amp;#39;t change and never will change. I keep asking myself &amp;quot;What if I was diagnosed earlier? Why did I have to fuck up all those relationships? Why did nobody recommend I seek help before? Should that have been up to me? Imagine what I could&amp;#39;ve done at school if I was getting treatment. Still, maybe it&amp;#39;s my fault I was the way I was, etc.&amp;quot; but on the other hand, I&amp;#39;ve never felt so at peace and relieved. There is finally an answer to why my brain whizzes at 1,000,000km/h with seemingly no indication of ever slowing down. It&amp;#39;s been a really weird and mixed bag type of realisation for me.

The only irl people who know of my ADHD are my parents but it's hard for them to understand why I can't just \"get organized\" or \"try harder\". \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,
