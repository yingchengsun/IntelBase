Since April actually. They put me on Saphris and it put the breaks on the mania but it was burning my tongue so bad the skin was actually peeling off. I tried taking Tums to neutralize the acid and now I&amp;#39;m taking like 4 tums a night to make it bearable but I&amp;#39;m worried about kidney stones. It just sucks because it was my 24th medicine and the first to actually work and now I can&amp;#39;t stand taking it. And symptoms are coming back (happens every March and November for me) so I guess it never worked anyway. Has anyone else had this problem with Saphris?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, my psychiatrist retired last month. I met the guy who replaced him last week and it went horrible. He recommended electroshock therapy as well as injections of an antipsychotic I&amp;#39;ve already taken and had horrible side effects on (like everything else). So I found a new doctor with the help of my DBT therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things went well with her. I was rediagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type and now borderline personality disorder. That kind of freaked me out. I guess the two kind of blur together for me. I&amp;#39;m going to continue with the DBT therapy for that. Medicine wise, she was thinking of either Tegretol or Trileptal and Clozapine. I&amp;#39;m not too nervous about the Tegretol or Trileptal because I&amp;#39;ve heard good things. Clozapine kind of scares me. I know its like the nuclear bomb of antipsychotics for treatment resistant psychosis but I feel like I&amp;#39;m at the end. Rather than put me back on another antidepressant which always induces mania, she said we might try Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation. So that is kind of nice. They do it at her office so I don&amp;#39;t have to go anywhere else. Has anyone had any experience with any of these meds or the TMS? She is getting a second opinion from her collegue who went to Duke and Cornell Medical School and she&amp;#39;s getting my records from all my hospitalizations. She&amp;#39;s very intelligent and I feel like I&amp;#39;m in good hands. Just looking for some positivity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things are going pretty well in life otherwise. I have a new boyfriend who is extremely understanding and supportive, more than anyone I&amp;#39;ve ever met. And I have one week of school left. It&amp;#39;s the first semester I&amp;#39;ve been able to finish in two years. And so far I have a 4.0! Work is going well. I am worried about the medicine change screwing everything up but I know having a breakdown would make it worse. So that&amp;#39;s where I am.

They put me on Saphris and it put the breaks on the mania but it was burning my tongue so bad the skin was actually peeling off. I tried taking Tums to neutralize the acid and now I'm taking like 4 tums a night to make it bearable but I'm worried about kidney stones. It just sucks because it was my 24th medicine and the first to actually work and now I can't stand taking it. And symptoms are coming back (happens every March and November for me) so I guess it never worked anyway. Has anyone else had this problem with Saphris?\n\nTo make matters worse, my psychiatrist retired last month. I met the guy who replaced him last week and it went horrible. He recommended electroshock therapy as well as injections of an antipsychotic I've already taken and had horrible side effects on (like everything else). So I found a new doctor with the help of my DBT therapist.\n\nThings went well with her. I was rediagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type and now borderline personality disorder. That kind of freaked me out. I guess the two kind of blur together for me. I'm going to continue with the DBT therapy for that. Medicine wise, she was thinking of either Tegretol or Trileptal and Clozapine. I'm not too nervous about the Tegretol or Trileptal because I've heard good things. Clozapine kind of scares me. I know its like the nuclear bomb of antipsychotics for treatment resistant psychosis but I feel like I'm at the end. Rather than put me back on another antidepressant which always induces mania, she said we might try Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation. So that is kind of nice. They do it at her office so I don't have to go anywhere else. Has anyone had any experience with any of these meds or the TMS? She is getting a second opinion from her collegue who went to Duke and Cornell Medical School and she's getting my records from all my hospitalizations. She's very intelligent and I feel like I'm in good hands. Just looking for some positivity. \n\nThings are going pretty well in life otherwise. I have a new boyfriend who is extremely understanding and supportive, more than anyone I've ever met. And I have one week of school left. It's the first semester I've been able to finish in two years. And so far I have a 4.0! Work is going well. I am worried about the medicine change screwing everything up but I know having a breakdown would make it worse. So that's where I am. Any positivity or experience input would be greatly appreciated!

My current phone is a S8 but it's not rooted so I'd actually have to pay to turn on tethering. Some days I find myself wanting to watch stuff on my tablet on long bus rides around town so I pop my sim card into my old Rooted Droid Turbo for a few days. Very few apps support cloud storage or sync seamlessly across devices. \n\nAnd Android being a very open platform has me constantly tinkering with my phone. This often goes wrong and I'm forced to do a factory reset. Google and Samsung's app data backup are both terrible IMHO. Restoring the apps without any of the previous data. Titanium backup works very well on my Turbo but anything I've tried on my S8 hasn't gotten the job done.\n\nI often think a spreadsheet with a number scale would be best for me (sans boring UI) but I haven't the slightest idea how to organize it and I'm a scrub with Excel. \n\nPlease share with me your experiences (good or bad) with mood tracking apps. Any systems you use or have used that you like for tracking moods. Don't really care if it's a paid app or not, but my spending limit is 2.99 and none of that recurring payment shit.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hwjlc", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Friends, Bipolarites, countrymen, lend me your app selections...", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "indigo", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hwjlc", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/bipolar/comments/7hwjlc/friends_bipolarites_countrymen_lend_me_your_app/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512574624.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7hwjlc/friends_bipolarites_countrymen_lend_me_your_app/", "author_flair_text": "Bipolar 2", "quarantine": false, "author": "Dekugon", "created_utc": 1512545824.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bipolar", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.bipolar", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "bipolar", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year has been one of the most complicated of my life, but in difference of years before, now i&amp;#39;m an adult... i&amp;#39;m 32 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m usually very anxious, I see all the variables of a specific problem and all the decisions I made to end in that problem...

Within that time, I got a bill (I self paid on the day of service) for 20 dollars more than their agreement, plus it was for \"parent management.\" I mean, I can understand one mistake, sort of, no matter how off it was. I'm relatively forgiving. Then the second mistake, which at that point I just sent them to voice mail. Two weeks later, another letter. Apparently I missed an appointment on November 28th. An appointment I never scheduled, never discussed with them. So tell me; am I wrong in not wanting to deal with the shoddy local mental health resource or not? I mean, I'd love to sleep like a normal person. To not be risky with my life. To not sleep as if in a coma. To not have weird ass manic states. (I clean, I don't get super happy, ever). It's just frustrating. I mean, I finally admitted I had a problem, sought help, and I felt/feel like I've been completely failed.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hxife", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Diagnosed, but mental health office is so inept I'm worried about making an appointment", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hxife", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/bipolar/comments/7hxife/diagnosed_but_mental_health_office_is_so_inept_im/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512589571.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7hxife/diagnosed_but_mental_health_office_is_so_inept_im/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "MayThirtyFirst", "created_utc": 1512560771.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bipolar", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.bipolar", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "bipolar", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was trying to describe to my dad what bipolar feels like, and I said that it\u2019s not the curvy line with hills and valleys to describe mania, normalcy, and depression.

Laughing over nothing, reorganizing my markers really neatly, cleaning my desk, attempting to dye my hair 3 times, write an angry email to the hairdresser who sold me the product only to proceed to cook for 3 hours? Some of these things may have happened at different times or days. Idk. Time moves so slow yet fast and is so bendy. Such an interesting thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uuuh anyway. I felt really good. Going back to school that monday. Being happy. But at the same time it feels like my body is still in depression mode? I feel tired and achy and kind of...wired? If that makes sense? But at the same time great. Like I&amp;#39;m in a movie, full of coincidence and kinda snarky I think. But today I feel kinda dreamy/normal but also really happy and restless and I don&amp;#39;t know anymore because I&amp;#39;m probably over thinking everything and bring confuesd like what do they mean with impaired function? I feel like I function normally but I have trouble focusing on one thing and get really irritable buti laugh and I also feel ambitious. I can&amp;#39;t always seem to understand others and vice versa and I just want to just take a flight to somewhere and just have fun but I haven&amp;#39;t done jack shit school work and I have an exam in two days but I frankly don&amp;#39;t care but I DO care. I loaned a ton of books from the library like russian grammar but I should focus on school cause I&amp;#39;ve been gone for a month but my mind is all over the place and I&amp;#39;m so confused because I&amp;#39;m trying to understand myself but I don&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m completely different from usual but what even is unusual I don&amp;#39;t even know myself. I don&amp;#39;t remember me before. I know I rented like 80 books/manga at once etc but I felt so normal during those times??? Clear headed and so?

She&amp;#39;s never had it easy. From a poor childhood to my abusive father. She&amp;#39;s at a point where she&amp;#39;s moved on and left all that behind and is finally having a break. I just feel so selfish dragging her behind with my depressed state. And I can&amp;#39;t exactly just go ahead with it either. As a child, I had always been her tail and stuck with her through thick and thin through her hard times like she has with alot of mine. When she would leave my dad on numerous occasions, she would find me waiting for her at the car refusing to leave her side. On the day when she left him for good and I walked in on my mother and my brothers packing, I remember the silence that fell in the room and there faces as they stared at each other and then me, followed by me breaking the silence with &amp;quot;well it&amp;#39;s about time&amp;quot; and proceeding to help them pack. Haha, I laugh a little when I think of the confused look on her face and the disgusted looks on my brothers, at their 11 (?) Year old little sisters response. My defiance at my manipulative fathers attempts to try and use me and my siblings to guilt trip her into coming back for &amp;quot;our sake&amp;quot;. Despite being just a child I was the only one who truly had her back initially. But , by just leaving, my corpse would plague her forever, and whenever I plan my suicide I&amp;#39;m so overwhelmed with guilt and disgust I cry. Today is one of those days. But how do I tell her? She would stress all the time, not understand why I would want to leave or consider doing that to her. Thing is, earth never felt like my home. I don&amp;#39;t understand how people can be happy here and see the good in life. I can&amp;#39;t believe that this is all life is. The only times I&amp;#39;ve experienced what it&amp;#39;s like to be happy is while drugged up on something good. I believe in the spiritual, and not the stereotypical story everyone believes in with hell and heaven. But I still cling on to some spiritual faith because I can&amp;#39;t believe that this all there is to life. I probably sound selfish saying all this when I have someone like my mother but.. she would never truly understand my struggle, or my decision. Not know what it&amp;#39;s like to not know what it&amp;#39;s like to not know happiness or to be at a happy point in life. My body and soul feels worn out and each step feels painful to take. I&amp;#39;ve become such a pathetic existence because everything feels like a struggle, From getting out of bed in the morning to the smallest social interaction. And when people look they don&amp;#39;t know, because all they see is a smile and laughing face acting social trying to blend in and act fine. Trying to avoid questions. Pretending to be someone I&amp;#39;m not so people won&amp;#39;t know the loathing person i really am who never had faith in humanity. All I want is out. I&amp;#39;m only 21 but I&amp;#39;ve seen too much, and too young. I was just born in the deep end. I&amp;#39;ve always felt isolated from other normal people and looked at them in wonder trying to fathom what it must be like at a normal age. How do I tell my mother how I feel? And what if she doesn&amp;#39;t take me seriously. Or gives me those lectures that normal people would give you , those motivational talks that captivated you the first time hearing it and instantly faded afterwards. And then it&amp;#39;s left at that. My job adds on further to my stress, because I just feel like a can&amp;#39;t do it anymore and it takes up so much of my already small life. I feel like I&amp;#39;m going to breakdown and get all that unwanted attention. Even though I probably won&amp;#39;t commit suicide and I&amp;#39;m being impulsive, I had existing this way.

However, when she explained to me that (paraphrased): &amp;quot;Wellbutrin is an SSRI, and so is Drug X, so we can skip the titration periods and assess the new side effects right away...&amp;quot;, it sounded reasonable. I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward three years, and as you can imagine, I was a wreck.

Even when my hips were sore and my office-mates were all wearing headphones to drown out the neverending chatter of keys, coins, chair components, whatever, I could suppress it, but it was always there. Over the coming months, the tremors worked towards my core, leaving me with that butterflies-feeling in my stomach. I had to lock my hand-muscles to perform any shopping whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, my doctor was desperately playing with dosages and introducing new drugs trying to eliminate the tremor, and if I had any wits about me, that&amp;#39;s when I should have asked for help from someone else.

When I asked for a print-out of my history, the tech asked if I wanted a list of all the pick-ups, or only a list of the varying cocktails I&amp;#39;d been prescribed, with a single entry any time a change was made. I opted for the latter, hoping to save paper. I clearly remember noticing the genuine smile on her face as she said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll go grab that off the printer!&amp;quot;... as I watched her grab the few pages that had come out, a look of concern crossed her face when she realized that the printer wasn&amp;#39;t done yet... and the look of horror that grew with every page further.

I never did actually count the pages, but there were at least twelve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The appointment with the neurologist didn&amp;#39;t last any more than ten minutes, and after a cursory physical exam he said &amp;quot;I see no cogwheeling, nor any delayed reflexive response.

I don&amp;#39;t know if this realization was part of it, but it wasn&amp;#39;t more than a week before my psychiatrist vanished from the health center, without any support offered to her patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say that her replacement has become one of my most inner circle, for a few reasons: First, he doesn&amp;#39;t even have a copy of the DTSM in his office, he instead opts to assess your mood and recent history through conversation, and he wasn&amp;#39;t afraid to ask for references from my friends and family. Most importantly, every time my prescription chaged, it was only after extensive discussion between the two of us, and mutual agreement that the change was the best course of action at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as much as I have come to trust him, I have grown concerned over the outcomes of our cooperative decision-making. Through careful and diligent tritration between medications, my regiment has exploded to a concerning array of drugs:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;300mg Lamictal once at bedtime (&amp;lt;--- maximum dose)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;800mg Seroquel once at bedtime (&amp;lt;--- also max dose)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3mg Mirapex once at bedtime (&amp;lt;--- 75% of max dose)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;80mg of Biphentin at breakfast (&amp;lt;--- max dose)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the latest addition, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1mg Prazosin at bedtime. (&amp;lt;--- the newcomer)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my questions are thus: &lt;strong&gt;how do you rationalize adding more drugs to your cocktail, when your current regmin is uncomfortably large? At what point does it become &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt; drugs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;#39;ve had a bad experience with Epi-Val, I welcome you to share your story below.

I don't know if this realization was part of it, but it wasn't more than a week before my psychiatrist vanished from the health center, without any support offered to her patients.\n\nI am happy to say that her replacement has become one of my most inner circle, for a few reasons: First, he doesn't even have a copy of the DTSM in his office, he instead opts to assess your mood and recent history through conversation, and he wasn't afraid to ask for references from my friends and family. Most importantly, every time my prescription chaged, it was only after extensive discussion between the two of us, and mutual agreement that the change was the best course of action at the time.\n\nHowever, as much as I have come to trust him, I have grown concerned over the outcomes of our cooperative decision-making. Through careful and diligent tritration between medications, my regiment has exploded to a concerning array of drugs:\n\n* 300mg Lamictal once at bedtime (&lt;--- maximum dose)\n\n* 800mg Seroquel once at bedtime (&lt;--- also max dose)\n\n* 3mg Mirapex once at bedtime (&lt;--- 75% of max dose)\n\nand\n\n* 80mg of Biphentin at breakfast (&lt;--- max dose)\n\nAnd the latest addition, \n\n* 1mg Prazosin at bedtime. (&lt;--- the newcomer)\n\n\nI guess my questions are thus: **how do you rationalize adding more drugs to your cocktail, when your current regmin is uncomfortably large? At what point does it become *too many* drugs?**\n\nAlso, if you've had a bad experience with Epi-Val, I welcome you to share your story below. For the rest of you, it's 4am Atlantic time! Wooo!

Like, yelled at me that she&amp;#39;s being as quiet as she can when I&amp;#39;ve confronted her one morning after waking up. It feels awful. I&amp;#39;ve asked her so many times. Politely.

She argues about how early is too early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning I got woken up at 8:30 am by her starting the washer. I had not slept well. This set off something in me that made me so fucking angry. Like slamming doors, pacing, writing too aggressive messy notes to tape to the dryer (I took them down before she saw them), almost knocking on her door, and hitting myself in the head from all the frustration. It was completely irrational and out of proportion. I calmed down a fair amount by venting to some friends over text, but when I heard her come back to start the dryer I opened my door to ask her to please wait until I can get some rest. I wasn&amp;#39;t really very angry at that point. More exhausted and at my wit&amp;#39;s end. Then she responded in her passive aggressive defensive way by saying &amp;quot;But how else will I get my clothes? It&amp;#39;s not that early, it&amp;#39;s 9am.&amp;quot; The anger had turned into a sort of hysterical anxiety at this point. I was shaking. I pointed out that she started at 8:30am. She finally noticed that something wasn&amp;#39;t right with me and asked if I was ok. I said NO I&amp;#39;M NOT OK in a sort of high pitched panic-y yell and pretty much begged her not to run the drier right now. She didn&amp;#39;t run the drier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologized via text, and she expressed concern and asked if she could do anything. But now I think she&amp;#39;s avoiding me. I saw her in person for the first time since that morning today in a class we have together and she didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge me at all. We had always chatted in class and would always walk towards our next classes together, but today she got all her stuff together and left as soon as possible without looking at me. I feel like shit. I just want to bang my head against a wall and punish myself for being so fucking crazy and scary. I don&amp;#39;t want to be angry. I&amp;#39;ve never hurt anyone and I never ever want to. I just get these rages. I hate it. It makes me feel so ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know, I just wanted to vent and maybe talk to someone who gets it.

For some ungodly reason, or maybe a very godly reason, its taken 7 months to finally get this appointment. \nWhich has made me very keen on staying with it this time, as i&amp;#39;ve been having mixed episodes. And omg they are horrible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;tr Become a stripper, make bad choices&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t believe all the crazy shit i&amp;#39;ve done. \nMy worst episode started 1.5 yrs ago after a bad breakup and simultaneously moving to a new city and having everything go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t save money well for shit, and had to move with about $800 to one of the most expensive cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got kicked out of my first place after 1 day for breaking every rule. It was one of those green living houses. No meat, no drugs, no smoking, no excessive partying. I thought i could live greenly and that it would be good for me so i quit smoking one day before moving in. 2 days before that i went out in style. Think limo cocaine and liqour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got to the new city and went out with 2 housemates the same night and broke every. single. rule. \nSmoking cigarettes, doing Drugs, and a lot of drinking. Oh and meat, I broke that rule too. Had a boiled egg in my bag the moment i walked in the door. \nI was slightly ashamed, but not as much as i should have been. Should have noticed i was manic, but nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had to house jump for the next month and a half. Between airbnb.. then the rest of my money got stolen at a private event and had to live with creepy guys off that website where you can find a place to crash for free. Only guys would answer me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re hoping you&amp;#39;ll sleep with them. Its like a constant battle of &amp;#39;yes im sleeping alone tonight&amp;#39;. &amp;#39;No i don&amp;#39;t want to sleep in your bed&amp;#39;. But at least i had a bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around now i went on a date with a guy, then gave him a handjob for $50. I was fantasizing a lot about working in the sex industry, so i was seeing how well i could handle it. \nOf course well, because im not feeling shit. I&amp;#39;m feeling rewards, only. The fact that i gave a handjob for it made it the prettiest 50 dollar bill id ever seen. Plus he let me take the wine. I was nearly skipping down the street.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue the voices.\nI started talking to one nearly 24/7. \nIt&amp;#39;s weird how much comfort it can bring. Time passed by faster, i always had a companion. Someone or something that &amp;#39;cared&amp;#39;.\nOf course that changed, later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice was certain i should stop trying to work and that i was going to win the lottery. This being my second major manic episode i was suspicious. &amp;quot;Hmmmmm, you&amp;#39;ve said this before. Didn&amp;#39;t end well. And i have no money sooooo.&amp;quot; \nI also hadn&amp;#39;t even purchased a lottery ticket, so logic won.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you question the voice or start to - they get angry. They raise hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So inner hell was raised, the relentless screaming and contradictions, i was nearly in tears in public, but im pretty good at hiding inner turmoil. Only really really observant people may notice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I beelined it to a Psych ward and i was able to get on meds within a week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But did she say on them?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LOL, No! Of course not!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Doctors insisted i shouldn&amp;#39;t be working, but refused to sign documents for me to be on disability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I told them i was going to become a stripper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They thought that was a bad idea, but still didn&amp;#39;t sign the papers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided they where getting in the way of me living my best life so, ditched the meds and decided to become a stripper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a typical social drinker before, so i could always hid my binge drinking easily. Working in the nightlife industry broke that right open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I loved it at first, dancing. \nThe sexual power, performing, the money.\nThe drugs, i always loved that first line of blow after having several drinks. It&amp;#39;s like being baptized\n&amp;quot;I can see clearly again, and i feel fucking amazingggg!!!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways i did a lot of blow. I drank every shift i worked. So 2-6 days a week.\nSome fun times! I remember working in the day with my friend who was a kindergarten teacher, and major alcoholic. We&amp;#39;d get to work at 3:30pm get dressed, take shots then go give some lap dances.\nI was new and innocent. I made 500 a day. 4:30 to 2am. because the moneyyyyyy high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got banned from 2 clubs. Like how does the cute girl from the suburbs get banned from 2 strip clubs in a big city?\nI yelled at a girl for sucking my clients dick. (she happened to look like me and leveraged me, and i wasn&amp;#39;t impressed. id been with him for an hr and a half - but had to go on stage - and she swooped!). \nSecond.. i started.. or finished a huge stripper brawl by throwing a curling iron at a girls face. Blood everywhere. The iron was off, i just happened to make the best throw of my life. Like if it was recorded on jersey shore or bad girls club i would be famous. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Found that i got very very turned on by the idea of fucking people i barely knew and being paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working in a stripclub makes this an easy possibility. It&amp;#39;s not &amp;#39;aloud&amp;#39; but as im sure you can tell i have a very small interest in following rules.\nFucked about 10 clients this way in about 3 months. \nI still dont regret those, actually. It was hot. It&amp;#39;s still hot to me. But normal me probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have.\nOne guy gave me 1000 for like an hour. \nBeing turned on and paid for it is probably one of my best hoax&amp;#39;s. They WANT you to be turned on. I wanted to as well, but i needed the money to be turned on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This manic episode was done with the saintly hopes and aspirations of the first one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted what i wanted, when i wanted it. I was not the girl you wanted to take home to mom. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be. Being a good person got me nowhere. i knew so many people who where bad people and they got away with it all, and life never beat the living shit out of them. \nI wanted to be them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Threw my bosses flowers in the toilet once, because they &amp;#39;needed water&amp;#39;. Unfortunately the toilet was full of shit. My boss wasn&amp;#39;t impressed and i was nearly fired. They knew me here, and other then my mental health i was caring, and honest, and thoughtful so they were going to make me take a break, which i took a week off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went home with a few clients. One time i went home with two, and one tried to rape me. Luckily the other wasn&amp;#39;t a piece of shit so i got free by scratching the everloving hell out of his face. BUT he did manage to rob me, which i noticed on my way home. \nThis put me in a depressed stage and it got so bad, the drugs, and drinking - that i wasnt making any money. I was getting sexually assualted nearly every shift. and i couldnt bring myself to be a cheaper escort (the fastest way to make money in the sex industry. But then its volume, not quality. For example a bp escort charges around 100 per person for 30 mins. to make 1000 thats 10 dudes. You cant screen, because these clients dont want to be screened. super unsafe. i didnt like that i couldnt choose my clients.) \nHigher class ones, independent ones, can make 300 an hr. Or 600 for 2 hrs if theres dinner and such. Also the men are just more respectable which was a tradeoff i wouldnt do without.) Also safety. - But you have to have your own website made, and i didn&amp;#39;t and i didn&amp;#39;t have the time. ANYWAYS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got a ticket home to my parents instead and iv&amp;#39;e been trying to normalize myself until i cant get on meds.\nAnd not die, as being bipolar has brought so many near death experiences into my life.\nI can&amp;#39;t believe that was all me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so excited to be on medication. I&amp;#39;m excited to stick with it no matter what.\nSince my first manic episode its been ups in progress then major crashes that ruined everything id built.

For some ungodly reason, or maybe a very godly reason, its taken 7 months to finally get this appointment. \nWhich has made me very keen on staying with it this time, as i've been having mixed episodes. And omg they are horrible. \n\ntl;tr Become a stripper, make bad choices\n\nAnyways the good stuff.\n\nI can't believe all the crazy shit i've done. \nMy worst episode started 1.5 yrs ago after a bad breakup and simultaneously moving to a new city and having everything go wrong.\n\nCouldn't save money well for shit, and had to move with about $800 to one of the most expensive cities.\n\nGot kicked out of my first place after 1 day for breaking every rule. It was one of those green living houses. No meat, no drugs, no smoking, no excessive partying. I thought i could live greenly and that it would be good for me so i quit smoking one day before moving in. 2 days before that i went out in style. Think limo cocaine and liqour.\n\nGot to the new city and went out with 2 housemates the same night and broke every. single. rule. \nSmoking cigarettes, doing Drugs, and a lot of drinking. Oh and meat, I broke that rule too. Had a boiled egg in my bag the moment i walked in the door. \nI was slightly ashamed, but not as much as i should have been. Should have noticed i was manic, but nope.\n\nHad to house jump for the next month and a half. Between airbnb.. then the rest of my money got stolen at a private event and had to live with creepy guys off that website where you can find a place to crash for free. Only guys would answer me.\n\nThey're hoping you'll sleep with them. Its like a constant battle of 'yes im sleeping alone tonight'. 'No i don't want to sleep in your bed'. But at least i had a bed.\n\nSomewhere around now i went on a date with a guy, then gave him a handjob for $50. I was fantasizing a lot about working in the sex industry, so i was seeing how well i could handle it. \nOf course well, because im not feeling shit. I'm feeling rewards, only. The fact that i gave a handjob for it made it the prettiest 50 dollar bill id ever seen. Plus he let me take the wine. I was nearly skipping down the street.\n\nCue the voices.\nI started talking to one nearly 24/7. \nIt's weird how much comfort it can bring. Time passed by faster, i always had a companion. Someone or something that 'cared'.\nOf course that changed, later on.\n\nThe voice was certain i should stop trying to work and that i was going to win the lottery. This being my second major manic episode i was suspicious. \"Hmmmmm, you've said this before. Didn't end well. And i have no money sooooo.\" \nI also hadn't even purchased a lottery ticket, so logic won.\n\nWhen you question the voice or start to - they get angry. They raise hell.\n\nSo inner hell was raised, the relentless screaming and contradictions, i was nearly in tears in public, but im pretty good at hiding inner turmoil. Only really really observant people may notice. \n\nI beelined it to a Psych ward and i was able to get on meds within a week. \n\nBut did she say on them?!\n\nLOL, No! Of course not!\n\nMy Doctors insisted i shouldn't be working, but refused to sign documents for me to be on disability.\n\nSo I told them i was going to become a stripper.\n\nThey thought that was a bad idea, but still didn't sign the papers.\n\nI decided they where getting in the way of me living my best life so, ditched the meds and decided to become a stripper.\n\nI was a typical social drinker before, so i could always hid my binge drinking easily. Working in the nightlife industry broke that right open.\n\nI loved it at first, dancing. \nThe sexual power, performing, the money.\nThe drugs, i always loved that first line of blow after having several drinks. It's like being baptized\n\"I can see clearly again, and i feel fucking amazingggg!!!\".\n\nAnyways i did a lot of blow. I drank every shift i worked. So 2-6 days a week.\nSome fun times! I remember working in the day with my friend who was a kindergarten teacher, and major alcoholic. We'd get to work at 3:30pm get dressed, take shots then go give some lap dances.\nI was new and innocent. I made 500 a day. 4:30 to 2am. because the moneyyyyyy high.\n\nI got banned from 2 clubs. Like how does the cute girl from the suburbs get banned from 2 strip clubs in a big city?\nI yelled at a girl for sucking my clients dick. (she happened to look like me and leveraged me, and i wasn't impressed. id been with him for an hr and a half - but had to go on stage - and she swooped!). \nSecond.. i started.. or finished a huge stripper brawl by throwing a curling iron at a girls face. Blood everywhere. The iron was off, i just happened to make the best throw of my life. Like if it was recorded on jersey shore or bad girls club i would be famous. \n\nFound that i got very very turned on by the idea of fucking people i barely knew and being paid for it.\n\nWorking in a stripclub makes this an easy possibility. It's not 'aloud' but as im sure you can tell i have a very small interest in following rules.\nFucked about 10 clients this way in about 3 months. \nI still dont regret those, actually. It was hot. It's still hot to me. But normal me probably wouldn't have.\nOne guy gave me 1000 for like an hour. \nBeing turned on and paid for it is probably one of my best hoax's. They WANT you to be turned on. I wanted to as well, but i needed the money to be turned on. \n\nThis manic episode was done with the saintly hopes and aspirations of the first one. \n\nI wanted what i wanted, when i wanted it. I was not the girl you wanted to take home to mom. I didn't want to be. Being a good person got me nowhere. i knew so many people who where bad people and they got away with it all, and life never beat the living shit out of them. \nI wanted to be them.\n\n\nThrew my bosses flowers in the toilet once, because they 'needed water'. Unfortunately the toilet was full of shit. My boss wasn't impressed and i was nearly fired. They knew me here, and other then my mental health i was caring, and honest, and thoughtful so they were going to make me take a break, which i took a week off.\n\nWent home with a few clients. One time i went home with two, and one tried to rape me. Luckily the other wasn't a piece of shit so i got free by scratching the everloving hell out of his face. BUT he did manage to rob me, which i noticed on my way home. \nThis put me in a depressed stage and it got so bad, the drugs, and drinking - that i wasnt making any money. I was getting sexually assualted nearly every shift. and i couldnt bring myself to be a cheaper escort (the fastest way to make money in the sex industry. But then its volume, not quality. For example a bp escort charges around 100 per person for 30 mins. to make 1000 thats 10 dudes. You cant screen, because these clients dont want to be screened. super unsafe. i didnt like that i couldnt choose my clients.) \nHigher class ones, independent ones, can make 300 an hr. Or 600 for 2 hrs if theres dinner and such. Also the men are just more respectable which was a tradeoff i wouldnt do without.) Also safety. - But you have to have your own website made, and i didn't and i didn't have the time. ANYWAYS.\n\nGot a ticket home to my parents instead and iv'e been trying to normalize myself until i cant get on meds.\nAnd not die, as being bipolar has brought so many near death experiences into my life.\nI can't believe that was all me. \n\nI'm so excited to be on medication. I'm excited to stick with it no matter what.\nSince my first manic episode its been ups in progress then major crashes that ruined everything id built. I've dropped out of school 4 times, quit countless jobs, moved cities, been jumped 4 times (sharp tongue, scorpio stellium in 1st house?), been kidnapped 3 times, etc.\n\n\nI know theres a good chance ill be numb, as medication for bp goes..  but im excited to be numb.\nIf theres any indication of how horrible this illness is, it's that i'm excited to be fucking numb. \n\n\n\nWhat was your worst manic episode?. \n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hdh5u", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My Worst manic episode (Starting meds tomorrow!!)

Takes about an hour or two to knock me out at night but at least I can say for once I'm actually sleeping and for the right amount of time too.\n\nBack when I was first taking the 50mg I noticed I was pretty depressed during the day. Not horribly depressed but still pretty depressed. But I also noticed my anxiety and \"running thoughts\" or whatever it's called were pretty much gone.\n\nNow it's kind of the opposite, I feel my anxiety and my mind is kinda racing again. Nowhere near as annoying as they were before but it's still there. And now there's an uplifting feel instead of the mild depression, which is good! For once I'm kinda calm and happy with myself and what's going on in my life. It's weird cause I never felt this way before but I guess it's normal? lol\n\nWhat I'm wondering is what am I going to feel after taking Sero for a longer period of time? Like I thought this stuff takes about a month or two to work so is it normal for me to be feeling this way after about 3 weeks since I first started with that lower dose? Is this what I'm supposed to be feeling? Is it normal for anxiety and random thoughts to go away then kinda come back? \n\nSorry if this doesn't make any sense I suck at describing what's going on with me at times lol. \n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gyuvo", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Seroquel by itself work?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "hide_score": false, "author_cakeday": true, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gyuvo", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/bipolar/comments/7gyuvo/seroquel_by_itself_work/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512198196.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7gyuvo/seroquel_by_itself_work/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Chainz702", "created_utc": 1512169396.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bipolar", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.bipolar", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "bipolar", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was shifting through mania and hypomania for pretty much all of October and November\u2014 I was so unstoppable I enrolled in 4 college courses for next semester, even though I literally dropped out of all three of my courses last semester because it was too much.

I missed grad school application deadlines so I\u2019ll be doing that next year but I just wanted to share my excitement of continuing to \u201chave a path\u201d.

Me being the smart one I am decided to stop taking Lithium without reporting it to my doctor because of the side effects it was giving me, thus leading Wellbutrin to make me hypomanic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to going hypomanic the medication had helped me get my life going again. Literally the same day I took it, I had energy to get out of bed, clean my room, organize my personal belongings, and begin producing music again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My problem with adding this medication to Lamictal is my PDOC thinks it will send me into hypomania again even though I am currently taking my mood stabilizer as prescribed; unlike my previous situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is how can I convince my PDOC to add this medication again? I am currently on 200mg of Lamictal and 2-25mg Olanza/fluox. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I understand Olanza/fluox is an SSRI/anti-psychotic mix, and Wellbutrin is an SNRI.\nI am fully aware of the fact there are different antidepressants meant to treat different symptoms of depression, but my PDOC doesn&amp;#39;t seem to agree with me, or even understand the difference between Serotonin related symptoms, and Dopamine related symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An SSRI is meant to increase Seratonin in the brain. Prior to my Bipolar 2 diagnosis, I had been prescribed Zoloft and it cured my suicidal thoughts, and constant anxiety; caused by serotonin deficiency, then I had my first hypomanic episode.

Me being the smart one I am decided to stop taking Lithium without reporting it to my doctor because of the side effects it was giving me, thus leading Wellbutrin to make me hypomanic.\n\nPrior to going hypomanic the medication had helped me get my life going again. Literally the same day I took it, I had energy to get out of bed, clean my room, organize my personal belongings, and begin producing music again.\n\n My problem with adding this medication to Lamictal is my PDOC thinks it will send me into hypomania again even though I am currently taking my mood stabilizer as prescribed; unlike my previous situation.\n\nMy question is how can I convince my PDOC to add this medication again? I am currently on 200mg of Lamictal and 2-25mg Olanza/fluox. \n\nFrom what I understand Olanza/fluox is an SSRI/anti-psychotic mix, and Wellbutrin is an SNRI.\nI am fully aware of the fact there are different antidepressants meant to treat different symptoms of depression, but my PDOC doesn't seem to agree with me, or even understand the difference between Serotonin related symptoms, and Dopamine related symptoms. \n\nAn SSRI is meant to increase Seratonin in the brain. Prior to my Bipolar 2 diagnosis, I had been prescribed Zoloft and it cured my suicidal thoughts, and constant anxiety; caused by serotonin deficiency, then I had my first hypomanic episode.

really tell.\nI asked about retirement age, they said this is a job for life,\nI wondered how I could get fired, they said there were several options pills, guns, a knife.\n\nSo I guess I\u2019ll just carry on, through the days that I am tired, through the days with no sleep, through the days when I\u2019m high, through the days when I\u2019m low, through the days I\u2019m struggling in a grey fog, through the days of lurid technicolor, through the days I want to be anywhere but here, through the days I don\u2019t leave my bed, through the days lined with tears, through the days lined with a manic smile.\n\nStill at times I can forget even if it\u2019s just for an hour or two, when the music plays, when out with friends, when I\u2019m dancing with you, when I\u2019m lost in a world I have written, when I see that girl and I\u2019m smitten, when I\u2019m up on stage, when I put pen to a page, when I\u2019m singing out of tune or when I\u2019m dancing like a loon.\n\nThen sometimes I can\u2019t avoid it it creeps into the places where I\u2019m trying to forget, it creeps into the places when I\u2019m trying to enjoy, and it all crumbles down.\n\nI\u2019d like to write a resolution, I\u2019d like to write a new solution, but I don\u2019t think there is one, I\u2019m sorry if some days go missing but I\u2019ve got another job to do.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort":

I took a 4 month short term disability from Work, but the meds began working. I did well. Until I went off my meds to have a baby.

I\u2019m always a little wary of giving myself any kind of label because of all the cultural notions that come attached to a specific word, and because I believe that every one has an individual experience of their lives that is difficult to label with broad, sweeping terms that contain any number of \u201csymptoms\u201d that may or may not apply to an individual. I think our cultural understanding of mental health issues is still drastically behind our understanding of physical health and still has a long way to go, unfortunately. But dealing with the stigma surrounding mental health issues is something that is very important to me, and I believe there are still many misconceptions floating around, perpetrated both in the portrayal of these issues in media and the Western-minded clinical approach to \u201ctreating\u201d them. That being said, according to the current level of understanding in the mental health field, I fall into the broad category of what is currently diagnosed as having \u201cbipolar I disorder.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m crazy. A lot of the stigma in our culture around mental health issues seems to suggest that people with mood disorders are incapable of making rational decisions. It seems to suggest that anything that they say or do should be held suspect or flat-out discredited, because they have a permanent impairment of judgement. In very extreme cases, usually the only cases that are reported in the news, it may be true that people with mood disorders have a temporary lapse of judgement and can do harm to themselves or others. But this is often just as true for many people who have never been professionally diagnosed with any sort of disorder in their life. Even if you have never been diagnosed with a mental disorder, unless you refuse to tell the truth about how you feel, anyone who has ever had a bad day could walk into a psychiatrist\u2019s office and it\u2019s highly likely they will have a diagnosis and a prescription ready for you by the time you walk out. Because that\u2019s their job. Mental health has become an industry just like any other, and at the moment it\u2019s tied in a close business partnership with the pharmaceutical industry. I&amp;#39;m not arguing that medication cannot ever help anyone, only that it\u2019s not nearly as broadly applicable to everyone as advertising might have you believe. The brain is an extremely complicated structure, and not everyone has the exact same neurological and emotional response when introduced to the same chemical stimulus. Don\u2019t you find it ironic that every anti-depressant advertisement comes with the warning: &amp;quot;may cause suicidal thoughts.&amp;quot; Is that not the one thing they exist to prevent? And yet, even in the face of these extremely obvious shortcomings, companies still try to push these medications as a legitimate treatment option for anyone suffering from a particular diagnosis. Just because someone has never been to a psychiatrist\u2019s office and therefore never been diagnosed with a mental disorder, doesn\u2019t mean that they are somehow capable of higher thought than a person who has been through the system and has been diagnosed. A trip to many psych offices is like browsing WebMD: no matter who you are or what you have, it\u2019s likely they will find symptoms and make diagnoses, justifiable or not. So in short, nearly everyone could just as likely be diagnosed with a mental disorder of some kind or another, at some point in their lives, and those that have been diagnosed are not essentially different from those that haven\u2019t. We all like to think of ourselves as \u201cnormal,\u201d but everyone is a bit broken in a way, and we all breakdown from time to time. No one I have ever known has had the perfect life required to be absolutely mentally healthy all the time, whatever that may mean. Mental health doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you never get sick, just as physical health doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you never get sick. It means being aware of your own weaknesses and dealing with them in a healthy manner when they occur. Maybe we should reach out and show a little kindness and compassion to one another, instead of condemning people diagnosed mental disorders as just \u201ccrazy\u201d and devaluing their experience of the world as somehow less rational than our own. Everyone feels elation, joy, sorrow, frustration, agitation etc., some more often than others. People like myself simply experience these common emotions with a higher frequency, variance, intensity, duration, etc. at times. We are just as human, and our thoughts and emotions and experience have just as much value as anyone else\u2019s. We are just as worthy of love as anyone, and just as capable at giving and receiving it. This doesn\u2019t mean that we are always right or wrong, and are just as prone to make mistakes as everyone else. But those mistakes shouldn\u2019t be scrutinized as being part of a unique mental deficiency, but rather as part of being a flawed human being just like everyone else. Mostly we are good people, and most of us have never imagined doing any harm to anyone but ourselves. Maybe it\u2019s time for a little openness, honesty and acceptance to take the place of prescriptions, fear and judgement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate any feedback that you might have to offer.

I had one amazing year in that period (looking back I was probably hypomanic at the time) followed by 3 years of apathetic/suicidal depression. The only thing that kept me alive at the time was a fear of the abyss (I don\u2019t believe in an afterlife). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally decided to get help last year nearly flunking out of college because I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I went on anti-depressed (Zoloft) not knowing I was bipolar and they worked really well until they made me go \u201ccrazy\u201d. I rapid cycled for a week after I quit weed (not realizing it was the only thing keeping me stable on Zoloft) and it was best/worst experience of my life. I went from feeling like I was the greatest thing since sliced bread to feeling like my mother just died on a daily basis. The high was so addictive I keep taking the meds even after I made the connect they caused the mood swings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually though I crashed completely and fell back into another suicidal depression. I stopped the anti-depressents and started smoking again. As I built a tolerance and because of my addictive personality I ended up smoking everyday all day. I was still depressed but the weed made me ok with that. Eventually I realized I wasn\u2019t moving forward in life and had become a total shell. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to check myself into an out-patient program for addiction and mental health issues and I\u2019ve been sober for about a month now. I also officially got diagnosed with bipolar type II, something I had suspected since the anti-depressant incident. I started back on anti-depressed about a month before treatment and within the first week of quitting smoking I started to feel really good, almost too good. I realized the danger I was in of rapid cycling again but I wanted to stay on the anti-depressants so I started a mild mood stabilizer (Lamictal).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a month into treatment and mood stabilizers (two months into anti-depressants) and I feel alright but something is lacking. I guess as much trouble as my emotions have caused me I kind of miss them. I got a little taste of bliss when I was sober and on Zoloft. Don\u2019t get me wrong I feel like the mood stabilizers are working it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know I feel like I\u2019m missing something. I just wish I could take anti-depressants and not have to dull my happiness through mood stabilizers in order to avoid going hypo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m posting all this I guess I feel kind of alone tonight and it would be nice to just talk to some people with similar experiences. I don\u2019t even need advice (although it still be appreciated) because I know I have stay on lamictal to stay stable. So yea thats that, any feedback, questions or conversation is welcome. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR\nRecently diagnosed with bipolar-II after struggling with depression for years and experiencing a rapid cycling episode due to anti-depressants.

I had one amazing year in that period (looking back I was probably hypomanic at the time) followed by 3 years of apathetic/suicidal depression. The only thing that kept me alive at the time was a fear of the abyss (I don\u2019t believe in an afterlife). \n\nI finally decided to get help last year nearly flunking out of college because I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I went on anti-depressed (Zoloft) not knowing I was bipolar and they worked really well until they made me go \u201ccrazy\u201d. I rapid cycled for a week after I quit weed (not realizing it was the only thing keeping me stable on Zoloft) and it was best/worst experience of my life. I went from feeling like I was the greatest thing since sliced bread to feeling like my mother just died on a daily basis. The high was so addictive I keep taking the meds even after I made the connect they caused the mood swings. \n\nEventually though I crashed completely and fell back into another suicidal depression. I stopped the anti-depressents and started smoking again. As I built a tolerance and because of my addictive personality I ended up smoking everyday all day. I was still depressed but the weed made me ok with that. Eventually I realized I wasn\u2019t moving forward in life and had become a total shell. \n\nI decided to check myself into an out-patient program for addiction and mental health issues and I\u2019ve been sober for about a month now. I also officially got diagnosed with bipolar type II, something I had suspected since the anti-depressant incident. I started back on anti-depressed about a month before treatment and within the first week of quitting smoking I started to feel really good, almost too good. I realized the danger I was in of rapid cycling again but I wanted to stay on the anti-depressants so I started a mild mood stabilizer (Lamictal).\n\nI\u2019m a month into treatment and mood stabilizers (two months into anti-depressants) and I feel alright but something is lacking. I guess as much trouble as my emotions have caused me I kind of miss them. I got a little taste of bliss when I was sober and on Zoloft. Don\u2019t get me wrong I feel like the mood stabilizers are working it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know I feel like I\u2019m missing something. I just wish I could take anti-depressants and not have to dull my happiness through mood stabilizers in order to avoid going hypo.\n\nI don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m posting all this I guess I feel kind of alone tonight and it would be nice to just talk to some people with similar experiences. I don\u2019t even need advice (although it still be appreciated) because I know I have stay on lamictal to stay stable. So yea thats that, any feedback, questions or conversation is welcome. \n\nTLDR\nRecently diagnosed with bipolar-II after struggling with depression for years and experiencing a rapid cycling episode due to anti-depressants.

Bipolar runs in her family, so she knew there&amp;#39;d be a chance she&amp;#39;d have it, but her episode was really pretty severe. I first noticed her as being a bit different to her usual self while we were revising together for exams. She said she felt like she wasn&amp;#39;t quite herself, and that she had been losing quite a lot of sleep. Over the next couple of months it gradually got worse, and she started being very active on social media - even streaming on Instagram, which isn&amp;#39;t like her at all - normally she&amp;#39;s very quiet. She started saying she was going to be competing in the Olympics out of the blue, and that the secret services had hired her. She became super active, going on ridiculously long bike rides every single day. As a result of the bike rides, she ended up injuring her back slightly (nothing serious), and she had to have an X-ray done. It turned out that everything was pretty much fine, but she managed to convince herself that she had lost control of her legs, and that she was going to be having an operation that may or may not bring back use of her legs. Anyway after that she was put in a hospital for 10 days, and by the end of the 10 days she seemed to be back to normal - she went on holiday with her family for a week and apparently she was perhaps a bit flat, but for the most part completely back to her usual self. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed fine until exam results day. In the evening after we got our results, she started turning manic again, but it was much, much worse than last time. On the first night she refused to sleep in her room, and instead slept in the summer house in the garden. She then ran out into the fields beyond her garden at night, screaming, and turned up at a neighbour&amp;#39;s house at about 3am, saying things about being chased. She then kept phoning me at 4-ish every morning, asking me to come over, saying her family had locked her in (obviously for her own safety) over night. Over the next 3-4 days she got pretty much no sleep at all, and got worse and worse. She started to completely lose track of reality. One day she obsessively pruned the hedges in her garden from morning until night. Another day she obsessively packed stuff for university for hours on end. She kept trying to prepare for a party for a day that had passed several days ago. She would never ever actually get a task done, because every time she started doing something she&amp;#39;d forget why she was there/what she was even doing. She couldn&amp;#39;t even pour herself a drink without getting distracted. One time she asked us to help her put stuff on the garden table in preparation for the &amp;#39;party&amp;#39; and she started putting her makeup stuff, toiletries etc. on the table, alongside paper cups etc. She stopped being able to keep track of the time/date, and was preparing/packing for a festival that had already taken place a week ago. It was almost like seeing someone with dementia. On the last day while she was at home she kept fainting and collapsing every few minutes, due to lack of sleep and exhaustion. I had to follow her around for t he whole day just to catch her/the things she had been holding in her hand. She kept saying she was exhausted and that she needed to sit down for a moment, but then suddenly her eyes would light and up and suddenly she&amp;#39;d suggest playing football or going to the park or something.  Alongside that she kept having rather unnerving hallucinations of all different kinds. She once again completely believed that the secret services had hired her, and she thought that the ambulance that was on the way was in fact part of the secret services that were going to take her away to Australia. At one point when we were talking face-to-face she seemed to think she was on the phone with me. It&amp;#39;s like her memories and thoughts of the past couple of weeks were all completely jumbled up, and she couldn&amp;#39;t seem to distinguish between reality and her own imagination. She kept getting everyone to do really peculiar things (she told us at one point to all grab an empty notebook, put on an apron each and write information about ourselves in the notebook) and got distressed and even angry if we didn&amp;#39;t comply. In addition to this she was extremely hostile to her parents, calling them all sorts of horrific things (I had never even heard her swear before, prior to her episode), even though normally she is very respectful of them.  For the whole of the final morning, she kept wandering around the whole neighbourhood, entering peoples&amp;#39; houses, randomly taking stuff, then going to the next house etc. (really lucky that she had understanding neighbours). Anybody that tried to stop her got a bunch of insults/rude words hurled at them. When the ambulance finally did come, she tried running away and they &amp;#39;chased&amp;#39; her round for around half an hour. She kept &amp;#39;tricking&amp;#39; them by pretending to choke as a distraction then running away again. Eventually out of complete exhaustion she gave up and was taken to the hospital, but on the way she was crying, saying that she&amp;#39;d end up killing herself, that it&amp;#39;s horrible there, that the other patients scare her etc. But the fact is that she had turned completely and utterly psychotic, to the extent that which passers-by were scared of her, and to the extent that I had only ever seen in movies - she really did need to be in hospital. A total of 23 friends/family were at her house that day just to keep an eye on her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While in hospital, I visited her multiple times. On the first day, she kept trying to escape, and was screaming at the top of her lungs/disturbing the other patients so much that they had to pin her down and sedate her. This happened multiple times, and she was put in isolation, but she freed herself from it by getting the staff&amp;#39;s attention by pretending to strangle herself with her bra. Once she got her way  by pretending to kill herself once, she kept doing it. E.g. when a visitor had to leave, she started pretending to strangle herself with a telephone line. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of all of this, she was moved into intensive care, with much stricter visiting hours, and a lot closer monitoring. The other patients at the intensive care place were significantly more ill than in the first hospital. Many of them had been there for years, and had serious self-harming/suicidal tendencies. For the first few days, she was so restless that they had to pin her down and sedate her at least once a day. Fortunately after just a few days there, she started showing huge signs of improvement. After a week or so she was moved back to the first hospital, and another two weeks later she was discharged, and completely back to being her old self. It has since been around two months, and both of us are now at separate universities. She seems to be coping very well with even the brand new environment and bigger workload, and has been completely stable for these past two months - we speak on the phone regularly and I&amp;#39;ve visited her a few times too. She&amp;#39;s taking all her medication and is getting plenty of sleep, which is very reassuring. As someone that doesn&amp;#39;t have the disorder, it seems almost miraculous that somehow she&amp;#39;s completely back to being her old self again, after having such a long, severe set of manic episode. But I&amp;#39;m aware that the disorder is called &amp;#39;bipolar&amp;#39; for a reason: that following manic episodes, one gets depressive episodes - but so far she has not yet had a significant low, only these two manic episodes. She does sometimes says she feels a bit flat on occasional evenings. What she (and her parents) seem most concerned about is that a very long, severe low might hit her, but they reckon that the medication is keeping her very stable at the moment. It&amp;#39;s reassuring that she seems stable now, but seeing how fast she went downhill after her period of &amp;#39;normality&amp;#39; between the two episodes, I can&amp;#39;t help but worry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, for those of you who are more knowledgeable about the disorder/have had it for longer than she has - is it possible that she might not have a low at all? Or is it inevitable, despite whatever medication she takes, that she will have a very hard-hitting low following this extreme manic episode? Finally, is the severity of her manic episode unheard of or is it relatively common (her father has had the disorder for over 40 years of his life and he said that he&amp;#39;s never had an episode as bad as hers was)?

I can't say anything to stop him. I don't want him to be travelling at this state. He might end up doing something stupid. I don't know how to talk to him at this stage, or if I can even do that. My mom's still trying to stay strong but she's taking all his mental abuse and insults. \n\nHe keeps saying that she's trying to control his money when he's the one who's jobless and won't pay his gambling debts or help him treat all his friends (or acquaintances) to lunch He gave me a lift to work this morning, to yell at me about my mom controlling his spending 'like he's a prisoner'. He tries to Uber people to earn side income, but he ends up giving free rides and buying them lunch instead, at my family's expense.\n\nSome people say to cut him off when he's like that, but my mom's been cushioning all his actions for years and all my relatives are very against leaving him to fend for himself. They continue to enable while he refuses to seek treatment.\n\nWhat to do? I'm at a loss... I really hope that he doesn't disappear to China (again).", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ga9ui", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My dad refuses to seek treatment...", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7ga9ui", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/bipolar/comments/7ga9ui/my_dad_refuses_to_seek_treatment/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511956008.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7ga9ui/my_dad_refuses_to_seek_treatment/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Iamonatrain_now", "created_utc": 1511927208.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bipolar", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.bipolar", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "bipolar", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s one thing I&amp;#39;ve always been good at, being way too early.
