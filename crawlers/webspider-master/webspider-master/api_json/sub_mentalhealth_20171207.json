(There were a few breaks in between.) Shortly after we broke up the final time, Kristen expressed via social media that I abused her. In truth, she was the one who was physically abusive and, consequently, felt defensive for having been. Unaware that I chose to keep my mouth sealed on the matter, Kristen went on Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter to spout tirades regarding our relationship. She provided vague details but with the clear distinction that she was somehow wronged. Kristen often portrayed herself as a courageous survivor for overcoming the ex-boyfriend villain. She was now someone who could \u201cgrab life by the horns.\u201d But I, on the other hand, felt degraded and dragged through the mud of Maury Povich-style drama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family can attest that I came home throughout the relationship riddled with scratches, bruises, and bite marks on my neck, torso, arms, and legs. These bite marks were not wanted in a sexual sense, nor were they cutesy love bites, but instead the detriments of Kristen\u2019s uncontrolled rage. During our relationship, she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and undoubtedly continues to struggle with her illness to this day. I implored her to go to therapy and to ask for a regimen of mood stabilizers. She made a half-hearted effort to change her attitude but never refrained from hurting me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever a petty argument turned to shouting, I always promoted a cooling period. I planned to leave for the evening and return the following day. No blame, no grudge, no conflict. But this is usually when she blocked the door to her attic bedroom. With no other way to leave the house, I tried to shift my body past hers. There was no alternative because I was raised to never lay a hand on a woman. This is when she would latch on and bite me in order to keep me trapped. It came to the point that my family detested Kristen and urged me to leave the relationship. But this trial with Kristen was my first na\u00efve attempt at love. I did not know any better than to expect things would get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, as with most situations that require optimism in the face of sacrifice, things got worse. There is one event that comes specifically to mind. It happened sometime in Act II of our turbulent relationship. Late one night, Kristen thought I was asleep in her bed. The TV was still flashing its bright colors in the dark corner of her bedroom, and she was zoned out, idly watching it. It must have been a couple hours past whatever time we were used to going to sleep. She tried waking me with a gentle push. I distinctly remember that. But I didn\u2019t move because I was exhausted and already dozing off. It was a thing of convenience for me to just pretend that I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Kristen dragged me on top of her chest. I was in a pair of boxers and a T-shirt, quietly participating to see where this was going. (We were already sexually active in the relationship.) Then, before a moment had its chance to pass, she started putting on a deeply affected whimper, and I immediately opened my eyes. She was so beyond sick in the head to say I forced myself onto her. She tried to pawn it off as some sort of sleepwalking trance state, with me on the verge of raping her. And with the obvious response, \u201cI\u2019ve been awake this whole time,\u201d Kristen immediately disposed of her\u2014what would a person call it? her botched scheme? Never again was it discussed, and so it remained this strange thing that continued to hang over our ill-fated time together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another day, late into the relationship, Kristen and I were arguing in my car. We were in her parents\u2019 driveway. I was dropping her off from school. Then out of habit, as a means to control both me and the situation, she clamped down on my forearm and would not let go\u2014like a rabid animal. There is no other way to describe it. With all her strength, she was biting me. I begged her to let go. But she wouldn\u2019t let go of my flesh, and so I begged her again and again. What more could I have done to stop her? She had already broken the skin. I was bleeding. She could taste blood, I was sure of it. And yet she persisted, sinking her teeth into me as hard as she could. I was afraid to pull away and have my flesh ripped any worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, after three attempts in asking her to stop, to do the right thing and stop, I punched her in the arm. Whether it was a fight-or-flight response is not something I can honestly provide in confidence. I really don\u2019t know. But I have my suspicions because it was the one time I ever struck a woman or partner, the one time in my entire life. And when the bruise on her arm started to show, I felt so ashamed of myself. I still feel ashamed, though I have reconciled it as a tense situation that required self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On another warm and sunny afternoon, Kristen tore my favorite shirt, a plaid flannel in jade green and black. She tore it right off me, button by button, completely ruined. And reflecting on this now in hindsight, it has become my interpretation that she did these things for the sadistic thrill of it because there were plenty of occasions we weren\u2019t even arguing, including this instance with the shirt. In a similar situation, I was just lying on her bed taking a nap, this time a real nap, and she started punching me uncontrollably. The only thing that kept me rationalizing our personal history was the sincerity of her apologies. She balled her eyes out every single time, with the wailing and the hysterics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we finally did break up, as I stated before, she began spreading stories to counter the ones that she presumed I was spreading, a show of her neuroticism. She told just about anyone and everyone who would listen. And because of her toxic bullshit, I lost friendships with a number of people, including my favorite high school teacher, someone who I considered a role model and a close friend, and someone who I would still want back in my life to this day. We were suddenly not Facebook friends any longer, and I could take a hint to fuck off. Kristen used to babysit this teacher\u2019s kids. So the only thing I thought in reaction was, \u201cDamn. She got to her,\u201d and, not only that, she got to her with all the time in the world to make up whatever she wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without an adjustment period to let her so-called wounds heal, without any time at all, Kristen alternated between one set of negative emotions and another set, which was in stark contradiction of the venting. One moment she would post fan-fiction where she fantasized herself as the girlfriend of whichever boy-band singer or Phelps twin. The next moment she was flaunting her victimhood in preachy, ham-fisted posts. Both sentiments, I have come to interpret, are just two forms of navel-gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since those dark days, I have been with someone else. We have been together for six years. We started dating the same year as the break-up, and my girlfriend (who is very much loved) would certainly explain to anyone that I have never laid a hand on her. We\u2019ve had arguments like any other couple, but not one of them has resulted in violence. Contrarily, we are both very non-confrontational people. It actually works when you have two halves that share the same moral principles. There came a point, however, that my girlfriend was tired of Kristen\u2019s outbursts. She was tired of the excess and the self-marketing, and so she felt morally obligated to stand up for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kristen expressed on Tumblr that she missed my company, and she even nostalgized our relationship on what would have been our two-year anniversary. My girlfriend, still calm and collected, as is her way of doing things, messaged Kristen anonymously. She asked her how she wasn\u2019t contradicting her earlier posts and the so-called pride of being rid of me\u2026 \u201cgrabbing life by the horns\u201d and all that. In response, Kristen said it was a difficult thing to explain. And, I mean, the logic checks out. Domestic violence is a complex issue. But the defensiveness that followed does not make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kristen demanded to know who was asking the question, listed a series of names of people she thought would call her out, and then promptly closed the account. This occurred around the same time Kristen wished publicly that my girlfriend be put through the \u2018same\u2019 experience and be beaten, which is a sign of immaturity and jealously more than any real-life experience with abuse. And as much as the online incident stirred futility and frustration in the both of us, the day my girlfriend confronted Kristen with the objective truth, it seemed to have quieted the gossip. Although, I imagine it has reared its ugly head from time to time, undoubtedly packaged in small doses for those who have already heard the tale because, surely, time does not heal all wounds when there are people out there, like Kristen, who are capable of undying vitriol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same year as my breakup with Kristen I dated a girl named Emily, for two months. Emily, like Kristen, wanted to be a published author. She compulsively lied about finishing this novel or that novel. She would announce her page count and quarter-milestones online whenever she had the chance, with Emily craving the perpetual support and adoration of the entire world. She once told me she planned to work at a publishing house. She reasoned she could push her writings onto employers. Take for instance \u201cNightfall,\u201d one of Emily\u2019s short stories, her star project at the time we were dating. A cleverly named protagonist, Night falls to his death. And that story was the epitome of Emily: a kitschy writer with big dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was during this time that she used an impromptu title suggestion of mine for \u201cNightfall,\u201d which she ultimately extended to the length of a novel. She renamed it because, as I offered in careful advice, \u201cNightfall\u201d hits the nail on the head a little too hard, and it\u2019s not worth giving away a major plot point before the audience has a chance to read your book\u2019s opening line, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Levity aside though, looking purely at the facts, would Emily have operated so receptively to my suggestion if she had such a bad experience in dating me? This was her baby, her first novel that she self-published with either her or her parents\u2019 money. Would she have taken my advice instead of someone else\u2019s? I mean, she had all the time in the world to come up with something, anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also had quite the cheering squad, as I recall. From one of her many unspoiled friendships, she could have taken their advice. That, or she could have made the brief attempt to come up with a one-word title on her own, because that\u2019s what I did. And yet curious enough, in a campus-based interview, Emily was asked where the title came from and, lo and behold, she lied about its origin. This is because Emily is the last person to admit her shortcomings, let alone as a writer. She is sociopathic, the type of person to select her intentions like an outfit for the day, the type of person to dissociate from facts and revise history. She does it to come across as a more interesting, well-rounded person, embellishing anecdotes and fabricating stories purely to have someone listen. It is a very dangerous thing what I am describing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the start of our relationship, back in May of that year, she listed the names of every ex-boyfriend who, in some way or another, abused her. She even assigned run-of-the-mill arguments\u2014arguments which were mutually the blame of her and another guy named Logan\u2014the rank of verbal abuse. This Logan fellow must have really scarred her with his powerful words, which is a tad overreaching in my understanding of petty shouting matches. But rather than saying anything, I readied myself for the next tall tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emily went to a pool party, she began, and one of the other guests was ex-boyfriend, Mark. I knew Mark. I went to school with him. He is best described as a rambunctious teddy bear, and he liked to hug everyone in drama club. He hugged me a couple times too, and I hugged him right back. He even hugged the girl who later became my girlfriend of six years running. To him, it was just a simple greeting. He would do it before class started. He had a lot of love to give, this Mark. He always had a smile on his face, and he laughed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the pool party, Mark apparently tried to drown Emily. In front of a dozen eyewitnesses, he stuck her head underwater and, by God, he was planning to keep her there until she went limp. Having heard this anecdote, having heard it eagerly from Emily\u2019s mouth, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes and said, \u201cHe must have been roughhousing.\u201d Well, wouldn\u2019t you know it, Emily insisted otherwise. \u201cNo! He tried to kill me.\u201d All the while, the story ended\u2014of course\u2014with Mark letting her go by his own volition. In retrospect, this should have been a red flag. This should have been a reason to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were just starting out as a couple, maybe three days in, and already I had the sneaking suspicion that this was a dangerous person. This was a pathological liar, someone like Amy Dunne without the riveting narrative of Gone Girl. But I shrugged off the Murderous Mark story because, after all, Emily was merely a spoiled teenager unaware of the consequences of her own words. Plenty of adults do the same thing. They have to discredit or trivialize their past relationships in order to build the importance of their current ones. This is not rare behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our progressive culture, there is a retaliatory type of partner who no longer says that such-and-such ex-boyfriend is bad in bed. They say he is a violent bully even when he isn\u2019t. And to be clear, this form of lying is anti-feminist and detrimental to the progress we have made as a society. It is a disservice to the women and men who are victims, who have stories that deserve validation. I mean, there is no gentle way of putting this. It&amp;#39;s sort of lost in the shuffle here, but I was later groped by a professor while I was going to college across the country. Do you think I feel ready to talk about it with anyone? Not with the reputation that I have acquired in my hometown. Those aren\u2019t subjects I want to get mixed up in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The grief is something to live with. It stays with the accused, and it eats away at them regardless of innocence because there isn\u2019t a person out there who wants to be persecuted. The so-called witches of Salem, for instance, were not relieved in knowing that they were blameless of a crime. They burned at the stake. And while I am using the immense severity of their situation to illustrate my point, the message I hope is not lost. It is a difficult situation because the moment you have to start explaining yourself, the moment you have to start appealing to others a certain way to make your case, is the moment you forfeit the battle and lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, with the haunting accusations that I have been faced with, I wonder to myself: Is there something I did wrong? Legitimately, is there anything at all that I did wrong? But I always arrive at the same conclusion, reviewing Emily\u2019s behavior throughout the relationship. She appeared genuinely enthused. She hung all over me, even in front of her parents as we sat and chatted on their patio. And as one might have guessed in reading that last sentence, it was pretty fucking weird that she did that. But it still speaks to a phony, plastic, and ultimately unrealistic idea of our relationship that she had cultivated for us to use as a point of reference. Emily was constantly referring to herself as a hopeless romantic. She looked up at the stars and commented on the beauty of the stars because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when you look at stars. She was so full of cinnamon-spiced shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another evening, and here is a contradiction of Regency convictions, Emily undressed herself in her parents\u2019 sunroom. This was not even two months into the otherwise gingerly paced relationship. She stripped down to a white bra and matching panties then urged me to have sex with her. I turned her down because I did not see us working out as a couple for much longer. I did not think it would be fair to take her virginity, nor did I want that responsibility. She only wanted to rescue us from the glaringly obvious decline in our relationship. Within two days, we were broken up and\u2014easily within a week\u2014Emily was dating a guy named Josh, and they were together for a while. In no way was this guy a rebound. He later became their class valedictorian. I was happy for her. I was happy there wasn\u2019t any doom or gloom. I was happy we stayed Facebook friends, as trivial as it may sound. The break-up was amicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, somewhere in the mix, Kristen contacted Emily, and they were suddenly friends of a superficial variety. What a coincidence. Fast forward to November (the sexual encounter back in June) and I was attending a high school production of one-acts. Many people were under the impression that I had abused Emily during the relationship. I was so deeply embarrassed that I had no way of defending myself. In fact, the buzz of their gossip sounded sleepy, like it had been sitting for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some acquaintances approached me with meager curiosity, like, \u2018Sure, now we\u2019ll hear your side since we\u2019re bored on this particular night.\u2019 They brought it up plainly and off the cuff. They might have been discussing their favorite colors before the topic made its casual entrance. \u2018Oh, hey, Emily\u2019s been saying this\u2026 Just thought you should know\u2026\u2019 In no way did anyone confront me as if the rumors were scandalous or urgent, and this ultimately felt worse. It felt like I had been robbed of my chance to nip it in the bud and stop this monstrous thing from being spread any further because, \u2018Who gives a shit? Obviously not this guy who isn\u2019t defending himself. Why isn\u2019t he flailing his arms and panicking?\u2019 And, honestly, I have to hand it to her. She kept me as a friend on Facebook where, as far as I could see, she made no such allegations. I was expertly walled off from any suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse still, here was a girl who wanted the public controversy, and for what? For feminist bragging rights? She wanted others to believe that a traumatic event shaped her into the woman she is today and provided her with priceless wisdom. How proud she would be if an honest victim came to her for council. I can already see the smug expression on her face. \u2018Let me teach you how to meditate. It is essential for stress relief.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the perfect opportunity for Emily to enhance her image, not that she devised the vengeful scheme on her own. The dead giveaway came in the form of little back-and-forths between her and Kristen, the \u2018I\u2019ll click the like button on your otherwise irrelevant stuff if you like my stuff\u2019 kind of Facebook bullshit. It was enough proof for me to realize it wasn\u2019t solely her idea to spread gossip because they are polar opposite personalities. One is psychotic and nearly friendless, and the other is more nuanced and socially regarded. They had no reason to interact with each other besides sharing a hateful alliance against me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon my arrival, I remember her \u2018fleeing\u2019 from the other side of the auditorium. She kept looking over her shoulder with this exaggerated look on her face, like she was running from Godzilla or King Kong, like I had arrived with a machete. And keep in mind I was 50 feet away when she started for the wings. Also keep in mind that I was there to support her. It was a ridiculous stunt, and without having to shift my field of vision, there was Brenda, Emily\u2019s mother sending me a big wave and a hello. \u201cLook who it is!\u201d she might have said in a sweet, motherly tone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She must not have heard the news. According to pretty much every teenager in Brenda\u2019s vicinity, her daughter had been abused and was quite broken up about it. Maybe it was intended\u2014exclusively intended for susceptible children to hear. But still, months had gone by since the break-up, and quite a few chances to say something in the sunroom with Mom and Dad must have been pissed away by talking about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it just made sense that Emily reserved her venting for unsuspecting millennials who were giddy at the thought of a moral crusade. But if she talked to a grown-up, things might\u2019ve gotten a little too serious. She didn\u2019t want to jinx her vacuum-sealed narrative that neglected to mention the part where she tried to fuck me the last day we saw each other as an item. That would be too messy to include. That would look poorly on her puritanical life with Prince Charming, and so this was the perfect motive for her to lie and hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moment I realized Brenda was being totally sincere in manner, I was relieved in knowing that this nice lady did not think ill of me. But I was also nonplussed. I mean, this is her only child with whom she shares a healthy, unrestricted dialogue and a mutually close bond. Their household rivaled the sensibilities of The Brady Bunch, sans five kids and a maid. I spent two months with Emily and there was not a peep of negativity directed at either parent because they were \u2018cool\u2019 and double-functioned as peers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the one-acts, I returned a greeting to the lady. I said, \u201cHi, Brenda. How are you?\u201d except the conversation was short-lived because I was making my way to the green room. I needed to hear what other people had heard, what friends of mine had heard. Seemingly everyone was aware of my plight and no one believed Emily, who had the reputation of being a sensationalist. But no one stuck up for me either, let alone were they outraged. The sense of betrayal I suffered has since led me to ongoing trust issues, and even my sense of humor has developed a misanthropic inclination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two years later, when I moved away, one of these so-called friends wrote on Facebook: \u201cKnowing you&amp;#39;re never going to see someone again, and there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do about it, is the most awful, desperate feeling I&amp;#39;ve ever felt,\u201d and these words shed light on how sincere a friendship can be. But like the others in the green room, this individual merely shrugged off what became one of my worst days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the only peer who did not shrug (besides my current girlfriend who, at the time, was uninvolved) was Anna, a girl in Emily\u2019s one-act, a girl who hardly knew me. She actually took the time to ask if the rumors were true, weighing the character evidence stacked against Emily and choosing to believe me once I explained my side. To this day, I am indebted to her for this small gesture. She did what no one else would, and it has gone a long way in terms of relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both Anna and my girlfriend (especially my girlfriend) have provided all the validation I have needed through this hardship. Without knowing it, they have swayed me from suicidal tendencies that I once struggled with in my youth, which is something Emily knew about. Her father drove me home from a mental health facility when my own mother (after committing me for self-harm) refused to be my ride. That is ironically what catalyzed the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was also there on the other end of a phone call when my brother ripped a lamp out of the wall and repeatedly hit me with it for talking to her. He liked her and thought she was his to claim. So it was plain for Emily to see that my home life was not as fortunate as the one she was gifted with. Shame on her and shame on Kristen for spurring a total loss of faith that I now have in people. Shame on them for plaguing me with this widely disregarded form of emotional abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If only there were a Chris Hansen type of interviewer to help me when these things were still relevant, he could have asked the one: \u201cWere you physically abusive toward anyone in your past?\u201d and ask the other: \u201cHow did you react after being sexually rejected?\u201d because these questions have gone unanswered for a very long time. There has been no cathartic release in all this time. And given the cultural climate, I align very much with what Terry Crews has said of his own experience. This is what PTSD feels like. PTSD is exactly what I am going through. I have been losing sleep over this, and drinking a lot of water in place of eating food. My stomach has been so tender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With total gratitude, I thank you for reading. Reddit is the only place I feel comfortable telling my account without the worry of reopening old wounds, without the worry of these two perpetuating their agenda, which they now have to stick with for the rest of their lives, or else face the fact that they are awful human beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I dated a girl named Kristen for about a year. (There were a few breaks in between.) Shortly after we broke up the final time, Kristen expressed via social media that I abused her. In truth, she was the one who was physically abusive and, consequently, felt defensive for having been. Unaware that I chose to keep my mouth sealed on the matter, Kristen went on Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter to spout tirades regarding our relationship. She provided vague details but with the clear distinction that she was somehow wronged. Kristen often portrayed herself as a courageous survivor for overcoming the ex-boyfriend villain. She was now someone who could \u201cgrab life by the horns.\u201d But I, on the other hand, felt degraded and dragged through the mud of Maury Povich-style drama.\n\nMy family can attest that I came home throughout the relationship riddled with scratches, bruises, and bite marks on my neck, torso, arms, and legs. These bite marks were not wanted in a sexual sense, nor were they cutesy love bites, but instead the detriments of Kristen\u2019s uncontrolled rage. During our relationship, she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and undoubtedly continues to struggle with her illness to this day. I implored her to go to therapy and to ask for a regimen of mood stabilizers. She made a half-hearted effort to change her attitude but never refrained from hurting me.\n\nWhenever a petty argument turned to shouting, I always promoted a cooling period. I planned to leave for the evening and return the following day. No blame, no grudge, no conflict. But this is usually when she blocked the door to her attic bedroom. With no other way to leave the house, I tried to shift my body past hers. There was no alternative because I was raised to never lay a hand on a woman. This is when she would latch on and bite me in order to keep me trapped. It came to the point that my family detested Kristen and urged me to leave the relationship. But this trial with Kristen was my first na\u00efve attempt at love. I did not know any better than to expect things would get better.\n\nBut, as with most situations that require optimism in the face of sacrifice, things got worse. There is one event that comes specifically to mind. It happened sometime in Act II of our turbulent relationship. Late one night, Kristen thought I was asleep in her bed. The TV was still flashing its bright colors in the dark corner of her bedroom, and she was zoned out, idly watching it. It must have been a couple hours past whatever time we were used to going to sleep. She tried waking me with a gentle push. I distinctly remember that. But I didn\u2019t move because I was exhausted and already dozing off. It was a thing of convenience for me to just pretend that I was asleep.\n\nThen Kristen dragged me on top of her chest. I was in a pair of boxers and a T-shirt, quietly participating to see where this was going. (We were already sexually active in the relationship.) Then, before a moment had its chance to pass, she started putting on a deeply affected whimper, and I immediately opened my eyes. She was so beyond sick in the head to say I forced myself onto her. She tried to pawn it off as some sort of sleepwalking trance state, with me on the verge of raping her. And with the obvious response, \u201cI\u2019ve been awake this whole time,\u201d Kristen immediately disposed of her\u2014what would a person call it? her botched scheme? Never again was it discussed, and so it remained this strange thing that continued to hang over our ill-fated time together.\n\nAnother day, late into the relationship, Kristen and I were arguing in my car. We were in her parents\u2019 driveway. I was dropping her off from school. Then out of habit, as a means to control both me and the situation, she clamped down on my forearm and would not let go\u2014like a rabid animal. There is no other way to describe it. With all her strength, she was biting me. I begged her to let go. But she wouldn\u2019t let go of my flesh, and so I begged her again and again. What more could I have done to stop her? She had already broken the skin. I was bleeding. She could taste blood, I was sure of it. And yet she persisted, sinking her teeth into me as hard as she could. I was afraid to pull away and have my flesh ripped any worse.\n\nSo, after three attempts in asking her to stop, to do the right thing and stop, I punched her in the arm. Whether it was a fight-or-flight response is not something I can honestly provide in confidence. I really don\u2019t know. But I have my suspicions because it was the one time I ever struck a woman or partner, the one time in my entire life. And when the bruise on her arm started to show, I felt so ashamed of myself. I still feel ashamed, though I have reconciled it as a tense situation that required self-defense.\n\nOn another warm and sunny afternoon, Kristen tore my favorite shirt, a plaid flannel in jade green and black. She tore it right off me, button by button, completely ruined. And reflecting on this now in hindsight, it has become my interpretation that she did these things for the sadistic thrill of it because there were plenty of occasions we weren\u2019t even arguing, including this instance with the shirt. In a similar situation, I was just lying on her bed taking a nap, this time a real nap, and she started punching me uncontrollably. The only thing that kept me rationalizing our personal history was the sincerity of her apologies. She balled her eyes out every single time, with the wailing and the hysterics.\n\nWhen we finally did break up, as I stated before, she began spreading stories to counter the ones that she presumed I was spreading, a show of her neuroticism. She told just about anyone and everyone who would listen. And because of her toxic bullshit, I lost friendships with a number of people, including my favorite high school teacher, someone who I considered a role model and a close friend, and someone who I would still want back in my life to this day. We were suddenly not Facebook friends any longer, and I could take a hint to fuck off. Kristen used to babysit this teacher\u2019s kids. So the only thing I thought in reaction was, \u201cDamn. She got to her,\u201d and, not only that, she got to her with all the time in the world to make up whatever she wanted to.\n\nWithout an adjustment period to let her so-called wounds heal, without any time at all, Kristen alternated between one set of negative emotions and another set, which was in stark contradiction of the venting. One moment she would post fan-fiction where she fantasized herself as the girlfriend of whichever boy-band singer or Phelps twin. The next moment she was flaunting her victimhood in preachy, ham-fisted posts. Both sentiments, I have come to interpret, are just two forms of navel-gazing.\n\nSince those dark days, I have been with someone else. We have been together for six years. We started dating the same year as the break-up, and my girlfriend (who is very much loved) would certainly explain to anyone that I have never laid a hand on her. We\u2019ve had arguments like any other couple, but not one of them has resulted in violence. Contrarily, we are both very non-confrontational people. It actually works when you have two halves that share the same moral principles. There came a point, however, that my girlfriend was tired of Kristen\u2019s outbursts. She was tired of the excess and the self-marketing, and so she felt morally obligated to stand up for me.\n\nKristen expressed on Tumblr that she missed my company, and she even nostalgized our relationship on what would have been our two-year anniversary. My girlfriend, still calm and collected, as is her way of doing things, messaged Kristen anonymously. She asked her how she wasn\u2019t contradicting her earlier posts and the so-called pride of being rid of me\u2026 \u201cgrabbing life by the horns\u201d and all that. In response, Kristen said it was a difficult thing to explain. And, I mean, the logic checks out. Domestic violence is a complex issue. But the defensiveness that followed does not make any sense.\n\nKristen demanded to know who was asking the question, listed a series of names of people she thought would call her out, and then promptly closed the account. This occurred around the same time Kristen wished publicly that my girlfriend be put through the \u2018same\u2019 experience and be beaten, which is a sign of immaturity and jealously more than any real-life experience with abuse. And as much as the online incident stirred futility and frustration in the both of us, the day my girlfriend confronted Kristen with the objective truth, it seemed to have quieted the gossip. Although, I imagine it has reared its ugly head from time to time, undoubtedly packaged in small doses for those who have already heard the tale because, surely, time does not heal all wounds when there are people out there, like Kristen, who are capable of undying vitriol.\n\nThe same year as my breakup with Kristen I dated a girl named Emily, for two months. Emily, like Kristen, wanted to be a published author. She compulsively lied about finishing this novel or that novel. She would announce her page count and quarter-milestones online whenever she had the chance, with Emily craving the perpetual support and adoration of the entire world. She once told me she planned to work at a publishing house. She reasoned she could push her writings onto employers. Take for instance \u201cNightfall,\u201d one of Emily\u2019s short stories, her star project at the time we were dating. A cleverly named protagonist, Night falls to his death. And that story was the epitome of Emily: a kitschy writer with big dreams.\n\nIt was during this time that she used an impromptu title suggestion of mine for \u201cNightfall,\u201d which she ultimately extended to the length of a novel. She renamed it because, as I offered in careful advice, \u201cNightfall\u201d hits the nail on the head a little too hard, and it\u2019s not worth giving away a major plot point before the audience has a chance to read your book\u2019s opening line, amirite?\n\nLevity aside though, looking purely at the facts, would Emily have operated so receptively to my suggestion if she had such a bad experience in dating me? This was her baby, her first novel that she self-published with either her or her parents\u2019 money. Would she have taken my advice instead of someone else\u2019s? I mean, she had all the time in the world to come up with something, anything.\n\nShe also had quite the cheering squad, as I recall. From one of her many unspoiled friendships, she could have taken their advice. That, or she could have made the brief attempt to come up with a one-word title on her own, because that\u2019s what I did. And yet curious enough, in a campus-based interview, Emily was asked where the title came from and, lo and behold, she lied about its origin. This is because Emily is the last person to admit her shortcomings, let alone as a writer. She is sociopathic, the type of person to select her intentions like an outfit for the day, the type of person to dissociate from facts and revise history. She does it to come across as a more interesting, well-rounded person, embellishing anecdotes and fabricating stories purely to have someone listen. It is a very dangerous thing what I am describing.\n\nAt the start of our relationship, back in May of that year, she listed the names of every ex-boyfriend who, in some way or another, abused her. She even assigned run-of-the-mill arguments\u2014arguments which were mutually the blame of her and another guy named Logan\u2014the rank of verbal abuse. This Logan fellow must have really scarred her with his powerful words, which is a tad overreaching in my understanding of petty shouting matches. But rather than saying anything, I readied myself for the next tall tale.\n\nEmily went to a pool party, she began, and one of the other guests was ex-boyfriend, Mark. I knew Mark. I went to school with him. He is best described as a rambunctious teddy bear, and he liked to hug everyone in drama club. He hugged me a couple times too, and I hugged him right back. He even hugged the girl who later became my girlfriend of six years running. To him, it was just a simple greeting. He would do it before class started. He had a lot of love to give, this Mark. He always had a smile on his face, and he laughed a lot.\n\nGetting back to the pool party, Mark apparently tried to drown Emily. In front of a dozen eyewitnesses, he stuck her head underwater and, by God, he was planning to keep her there until she went limp. Having heard this anecdote, having heard it eagerly from Emily\u2019s mouth, I resisted the urge to roll my eyes and said, \u201cHe must have been roughhousing.\u201d Well, wouldn\u2019t you know it, Emily insisted otherwise. \u201cNo! He tried to kill me.\u201d All the while, the story ended\u2014of course\u2014with Mark letting her go by his own volition. In retrospect, this should have been a red flag. This should have been a reason to walk away.\n\nWe were just starting out as a couple, maybe three days in, and already I had the sneaking suspicion that this was a dangerous person. This was a pathological liar, someone like Amy Dunne without the riveting narrative of Gone Girl. But I shrugged off the Murderous Mark story because, after all, Emily was merely a spoiled teenager unaware of the consequences of her own words. Plenty of adults do the same thing. They have to discredit or trivialize their past relationships in order to build the importance of their current ones. This is not rare behavior.\n\nIn our progressive culture, there is a retaliatory type of partner who no longer says that such-and-such ex-boyfriend is bad in bed. They say he is a violent bully even when he isn\u2019t. And to be clear, this form of lying is anti-feminist and detrimental to the progress we have made as a society. It is a disservice to the women and men who are victims, who have stories that deserve validation. I mean, there is no gentle way of putting this. It's sort of lost in the shuffle here, but I was later groped by a professor while I was going to college across the country. Do you think I feel ready to talk about it with anyone? Not with the reputation that I have acquired in my hometown. Those aren\u2019t subjects I want to get mixed up in.\n\nThe grief is something to live with. It stays with the accused, and it eats away at them regardless of innocence because there isn\u2019t a person out there who wants to be persecuted. The so-called witches of Salem, for instance, were not relieved in knowing that they were blameless of a crime. They burned at the stake. And while I am using the immense severity of their situation to illustrate my point, the message I hope is not lost. It is a difficult situation because the moment you have to start explaining yourself, the moment you have to start appealing to others a certain way to make your case, is the moment you forfeit the battle and lose.\n\nSometimes, with the haunting accusations that I have been faced with, I wonder to myself: Is there something I did wrong? Legitimately, is there anything at all that I did wrong? But I always arrive at the same conclusion, reviewing Emily\u2019s behavior throughout the relationship. She appeared genuinely enthused. She hung all over me, even in front of her parents as we sat and chatted on their patio. And as one might have guessed in reading that last sentence, it was pretty fucking weird that she did that. But it still speaks to a phony, plastic, and ultimately unrealistic idea of our relationship that she had cultivated for us to use as a point of reference. Emily was constantly referring to herself as a hopeless romantic. She looked up at the stars and commented on the beauty of the stars because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when you look at stars. She was so full of cinnamon-spiced shit.\n\nAnother evening, and here is a contradiction of Regency convictions, Emily undressed herself in her parents\u2019 sunroom. This was not even two months into the otherwise gingerly paced relationship. She stripped down to a white bra and matching panties then urged me to have sex with her. I turned her down because I did not see us working out as a couple for much longer. I did not think it would be fair to take her virginity, nor did I want that responsibility. She only wanted to rescue us from the glaringly obvious decline in our relationship. Within two days, we were broken up and\u2014easily within a week\u2014Emily was dating a guy named Josh, and they were together for a while. In no way was this guy a rebound. He later became their class valedictorian. I was happy for her. I was happy there wasn\u2019t any doom or gloom. I was happy we stayed Facebook friends, as trivial as it may sound. The break-up was amicable.\n\nHowever, somewhere in the mix, Kristen contacted Emily, and they were suddenly friends of a superficial variety. What a coincidence. Fast forward to November (the sexual encounter back in June) and I was attending a high school production of one-acts. Many people were under the impression that I had abused Emily during the relationship. I was so deeply embarrassed that I had no way of defending myself. In fact, the buzz of their gossip sounded sleepy, like it had been sitting for a while.\n\nSome acquaintances approached me with meager curiosity, like, \u2018Sure, now we\u2019ll hear your side since we\u2019re bored on this particular night.\u2019 They brought it up plainly and off the cuff. They might have been discussing their favorite colors before the topic made its casual entrance. \u2018Oh, hey, Emily\u2019s been saying this\u2026 Just thought you should know\u2026\u2019 In no way did anyone confront me as if the rumors were scandalous or urgent, and this ultimately felt worse. It felt like I had been robbed of my chance to nip it in the bud and stop this monstrous thing from being spread any further because, \u2018Who gives a shit? Obviously not this guy who isn\u2019t defending himself. Why isn\u2019t he flailing his arms and panicking?\u2019 And, honestly, I have to hand it to her. She kept me as a friend on Facebook where, as far as I could see, she made no such allegations. I was expertly walled off from any suspicion.\n\nWorse still, here was a girl who wanted the public controversy, and for what? For feminist bragging rights? She wanted others to believe that a traumatic event shaped her into the woman she is today and provided her with priceless wisdom. How proud she would be if an honest victim came to her for council. I can already see the smug expression on her face. \u2018Let me teach you how to meditate. It is essential for stress relief.\u2019\n\nThis was the perfect opportunity for Emily to enhance her image, not that she devised the vengeful scheme on her own. The dead giveaway came in the form of little back-and-forths between her and Kristen, the \u2018I\u2019ll click the like button on your otherwise irrelevant stuff if you like my stuff\u2019 kind of Facebook bullshit. It was enough proof for me to realize it wasn\u2019t solely her idea to spread gossip because they are polar opposite personalities. One is psychotic and nearly friendless, and the other is more nuanced and socially regarded. They had no reason to interact with each other besides sharing a hateful alliance against me.\n\nUpon my arrival, I remember her \u2018fleeing\u2019 from the other side of the auditorium. She kept looking over her shoulder with this exaggerated look on her face, like she was running from Godzilla or King Kong, like I had arrived with a machete. And keep in mind I was 50 feet away when she started for the wings. Also keep in mind that I was there to support her. It was a ridiculous stunt, and without having to shift my field of vision, there was Brenda, Emily\u2019s mother sending me a big wave and a hello. \u201cLook who it is!\u201d she might have said in a sweet, motherly tone.\n\nShe must not have heard the news. According to pretty much every teenager in Brenda\u2019s vicinity, her daughter had been abused and was quite broken up about it. Maybe it was intended\u2014exclusively intended for susceptible children to hear. But still, months had gone by since the break-up, and quite a few chances to say something in the sunroom with Mom and Dad must have been pissed away by talking about anything else.\n\nSo it just made sense that Emily reserved her venting for unsuspecting millennials who were giddy at the thought of a moral crusade. But if she talked to a grown-up, things might\u2019ve gotten a little too serious. She didn\u2019t want to jinx her vacuum-sealed narrative that neglected to mention the part where she tried to fuck me the last day we saw each other as an item. That would be too messy to include. That would look poorly on her puritanical life with Prince Charming, and so this was the perfect motive for her to lie and hurt me.\n\nThe moment I realized Brenda was being totally sincere in manner, I was relieved in knowing that this nice lady did not think ill of me. But I was also nonplussed. I mean, this is her only child with whom she shares a healthy, unrestricted dialogue and a mutually close bond. Their household rivaled the sensibilities of The Brady Bunch, sans five kids and a maid. I spent two months with Emily and there was not a peep of negativity directed at either parent because they were \u2018cool\u2019 and double-functioned as peers.\n\nBack to the one-acts, I returned a greeting to the lady. I said, \u201cHi, Brenda. How are you?\u201d except the conversation was short-lived because I was making my way to the green room. I needed to hear what other people had heard, what friends of mine had heard. Seemingly everyone was aware of my plight and no one believed Emily, who had the reputation of being a sensationalist. But no one stuck up for me either, let alone were they outraged. The sense of betrayal I suffered has since led me to ongoing trust issues, and even my sense of humor has developed a misanthropic inclination.\n\nTwo years later, when I moved away, one of these so-called friends wrote on Facebook: \u201cKnowing you're never going to see someone again, and there's nothing you can do about it, is the most awful, desperate feeling I've ever felt,\u201d and these words shed light on how sincere a friendship can be. But like the others in the green room, this individual merely shrugged off what became one of my worst days.\n\nIn fact, the only peer who did not shrug (besides my current girlfriend who, at the time, was uninvolved) was Anna, a girl in Emily\u2019s one-act, a girl who hardly knew me. She actually took the time to ask if the rumors were true, weighing the character evidence stacked against Emily and choosing to believe me once I explained my side. To this day, I am indebted to her for this small gesture. She did what no one else would, and it has gone a long way in terms of relief.\n\nBoth Anna and my girlfriend (especially my girlfriend) have provided all the validation I have needed through this hardship. Without knowing it, they have swayed me from suicidal tendencies that I once struggled with in my youth, which is something Emily knew about. Her father drove me home from a mental health facility when my own mother (after committing me for self-harm) refused to be my ride. That is ironically what catalyzed the relationship.\n\nShe was also there on the other end of a phone call when my brother ripped a lamp out of the wall and repeatedly hit me with it for talking to her. He liked her and thought she was his to claim. So it was plain for Emily to see that my home life was not as fortunate as the one she was gifted with. Shame on her and shame on Kristen for spurring a total loss of faith that I now have in people. Shame on them for plaguing me with this widely disregarded form of emotional abuse.\n\nIf only there were a Chris Hansen type of interviewer to help me when these things were still relevant, he could have asked the one: \u201cWere you physically abusive toward anyone in your past?\u201d and ask the other: \u201cHow did you react after being sexually rejected?\u201d because these questions have gone unanswered for a very long time. There has been no cathartic release in all this time. And given the cultural climate, I align very much with what Terry Crews has said of his own experience. This is what PTSD feels like. PTSD is exactly what I am going through. I have been losing sleep over this, and drinking a lot of water in place of eating food. My stomach has been so tender.\n\nWith total gratitude, I thank you for reading.

It is so worn out because the 6 months of DP were too much I guess. It is so worn out that I could convince myself that I died when DP hit me in February. There is nothing worse than no symptoms but still irrational thinking. It recently hit me with massive bouts of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It feels like I shouldnt be here anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 months ago I thought suicide was an absurd thing (for me) and even during DP suicide didnt even cross my mind one single time. But now it feels like my worst imaginations came true and it is just pure mental pain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything about future is triggering the hell out of me, I cant picture myself in the future anymore without thinking (maybe I might have killed myself by then?!), it is so difficult to even hold the place at university, but Ive already decided that I&amp;#39;d drop out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all changed in July where I had ups and downs but in the beginning of August these intrusive bouts of suicidal thoughts (like I hit a threshold and the only way out would be suicide, because it felt so terribly painful, like I was destined to suicide) hit me out of the blue and I suddenly became paranoid of time and future... It is not that I dont want to live anymore but my mind doesnt.

It is so worn out because the 6 months of DP were too much I guess. It is so worn out that I could convince myself that I died when DP hit me in February. There is nothing worse than no symptoms but still irrational thinking. It recently hit me with massive bouts of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. It feels like I shouldnt be here anymore. \n\n4 months ago I thought suicide was an absurd thing (for me) and even during DP suicide didnt even cross my mind one single time. But now it feels like my worst imaginations came true and it is just pure mental pain. \n\nEverything about future is triggering the hell out of me, I cant picture myself in the future anymore without thinking (maybe I might have killed myself by then?!), it is so difficult to even hold the place at university, but Ive already decided that I'd drop out. \n\nIt all changed in July where I had ups and downs but in the beginning of August these intrusive bouts of suicidal thoughts (like I hit a threshold and the only way out would be suicide, because it felt so terribly painful, like I was destined to suicide) hit me out of the blue and I suddenly became paranoid of time and future... It is not that I dont want to live anymore but my mind doesnt.

I don\u2019t really know what I am looking for, but I guess mostly I just want to blurt out all my feelings to a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to just explain everything so sorry for the wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I have a memory of being in primary school and thinking that everyone I loved would be better off if I died, that my parents would be happier to have more money and that none of my friends like me anyway. And basically, that has been the theme for the past decade and a half-ish since. It isn\u2019t constant, for most of the time I\u2019m happy and energetic and enthusiastic about the things I love. I do have low self-esteem, I believe I am generally terrible, I think all my achievements are down to luck rather than ability and I tend to always doubt that people actually like me, but for the most part I don\u2019t let it get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s just every now and then \u2013 usually around once or twice a month \u2013 I just feel awful. Sometimes it\u2019s because of something specific \u2013 like I\u2019m finding my university work difficult or I\u2019ve sat and stared at the ceiling for an hour because I can\u2019t get myself to start an essay or basically every time I go clothes shopping and feel bad about my appearance\u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s for no reason, I just wake up and think of all the reasons I have to hate myself. I feel weary, hopeless, tearful, guilt-ridden, I have no motivation to do anything, I don\u2019t care about my own health, I feel bad about being overweight so I try and stop eating, but then I just end up eating too much, I find ways to hurt myself like punching myself, scratching my skin or holding my hand under the hot tap, I think about suicide a lot and at the lowest points all I can think about it suicide. Like, all I can do is look for various ways to die in everyday life or I start mentally drafting my suicide note or thinking about potential plans or sometimes it is simply the phrase \u201cI want to die\u201d droning over and over again in my head. But I\u2019m not actually at risk of doing it, as the impulsive thought are just thoughts and the actual plans all end up coming back to the idea that my family and partner would be upset so I have to wait until they are all gone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t want to go to a doctor as I\u2019m worried they will just tell me to eat healthily and exercise more, or maybe they\u2019ll tell me to stop making a fuss and I don\u2019t know how I would handle that.

I don\u2019t really know what I am looking for, but I guess mostly I just want to blurt out all my feelings to a bunch of people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to just explain everything so sorry for the wall of text.\n\n\nI have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I have a memory of being in primary school and thinking that everyone I loved would be better off if I died, that my parents would be happier to have more money and that none of my friends like me anyway. And basically, that has been the theme for the past decade and a half-ish since. It isn\u2019t constant, for most of the time I\u2019m happy and energetic and enthusiastic about the things I love. I do have low self-esteem, I believe I am generally terrible, I think all my achievements are down to luck rather than ability and I tend to always doubt that people actually like me, but for the most part I don\u2019t let it get in the way.\n\n\nIt\u2019s just every now and then \u2013 usually around once or twice a month \u2013 I just feel awful. Sometimes it\u2019s because of something specific \u2013 like I\u2019m finding my university work difficult or I\u2019ve sat and stared at the ceiling for an hour because I can\u2019t get myself to start an essay or basically every time I go clothes shopping and feel bad about my appearance\u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s for no reason, I just wake up and think of all the reasons I have to hate myself. I feel weary, hopeless, tearful, guilt-ridden, I have no motivation to do anything, I don\u2019t care about my own health, I feel bad about being overweight so I try and stop eating, but then I just end up eating too much, I find ways to hurt myself like punching myself, scratching my skin or holding my hand under the hot tap, I think about suicide a lot and at the lowest points all I can think about it suicide. Like, all I can do is look for various ways to die in everyday life or I start mentally drafting my suicide note or thinking about potential plans or sometimes it is simply the phrase \u201cI want to die\u201d droning over and over again in my head. But I\u2019m not actually at risk of doing it, as the impulsive thought are just thoughts and the actual plans all end up coming back to the idea that my family and partner would be upset so I have to wait until they are all gone. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want to go to a doctor as I\u2019m worried they will just tell me to eat healthily and exercise more, or maybe they\u2019ll tell me to stop making a fuss and I don\u2019t know how I would handle that. Besides, although I am incredibly grateful for the NHS and I would not be able to afford health care otherwise, I have heard that their waiting lists for therapy are months long.

I recently had a string of panic attacks on my college campus back to back for about a week. My heart was racing almost nonstop. I came home for the weekend and the panic continued. Whenever I tried doing any of my school work or thought about what I had I began to shake, cry, have trouble breathing etc. I tried going back to campus to finish out the week, but even the thoughts of going to an academic building to collect data I needed caused my legs to shake, heart to race, and I began to cry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to go home for the semester and take &amp;quot;incompletes&amp;quot; for my classes, which essentially means I turn them in next semester when the assignments are completed/exams are ready to be taken. I have been home since Monday, and whenever I thought about doing the work I began to break down from anxiety, it was like there was a wall between myself and my work. Emailing professors and others on my college campus about my options throughout this process was also extremely stressful and caused me to panic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was starting to feel like I could never relieve this anxiety because the work was in the way (albeit small) felt insurmountable due to the immense anxiety it caused me to even think about doing it. It was especially frustrating because it&amp;#39;s the holidays and everyone is supposed to be happy. I started getting jealous at my brothers and sisters, friends and family for being happy when I felt my life was falling apart around me. I couldn&amp;#39;t connect with my friends and felt like I couldn&amp;#39;t talk to them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I emailed a professor recently about the work I must complete, and he sent me a very assuring message telling me not to worry about it for now and just to focus on getting better. I sent him a draft for the paper I need to work on and he said he wouldn&amp;#39;t look at it until a week or two from now to make sure I&amp;#39;m spending time getting better. He encourage me to do things that make me happy, engage in things I enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gotten so many messages like this from the faculty at my school, and, while amazing, only relieved my anxiety temporarily. However, it&amp;#39;s been a few hours since I got the email mentioned above, and for whatever reason I feel an immense amount of relief. I still do not feel able to complete the work right now, and thinking about doing it causes my heart to beat a little faster, but it&amp;#39;s not nearly as severe as it was merely hours ago, during which I was frequently in tears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some reason I feel so...frustrated? I was planning to need therapy and see psychiatrists and be put on medication. However, now it feels like I&amp;#39;m this pathetic person who freaked out over nothing. I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine feeling this way before; all I wanted was to feel better and I hated the anxiety. I wanted therapy and medication, any sort of treatment as soon as possible in order to relieve it. I&amp;#39;ve already made an appointment with a psychiatrist and called multiple therapists. So why do I feel so angry at myself for feeling a little better? I keep catching myself thinking &amp;quot;I shouldn&amp;#39;t feel good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;my heart should be racing/I should be anxious right now.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can anyone relate to this or be able to help explain what I am going through? I&amp;#39;ve dealt with panic attacks before, but never back to back like I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing. It&amp;#39;s been a hellish experience, truly, so I don&amp;#39;t understand why I feel the way I do right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for such a long post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: typo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Another thing I should mention is that around the same time I began telling myself that my brain was an organ like all the others in my body, and that when a body part is strained by overactivity, poor diet, dehydration, etc., it suffers. This could also be what caused me some relief, but this thought was spurred by the email from my professor. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm so confused right now.

I still do not feel able to complete the work right now, and thinking about doing it causes my heart to beat a little faster, but it's not nearly as severe as it was merely hours ago, during which I was frequently in tears. \n\n\nFor some reason I feel so...frustrated? I was planning to need therapy and see psychiatrists and be put on medication. However, now it feels like I'm this pathetic person who freaked out over nothing. I couldn't imagine feeling this way before; all I wanted was to feel better and I hated the anxiety. I wanted therapy and medication, any sort of treatment as soon as possible in order to relieve it. I've already made an appointment with a psychiatrist and called multiple therapists. So why do I feel so angry at myself for feeling a little better? I keep catching myself thinking \"I shouldn't feel good\" and \"my heart should be racing/I should be anxious right now.\" \n\n\nCan anyone relate to this or be able to help explain what I am going through? I've dealt with panic attacks before, but never back to back like I've been experiencing. It's been a hellish experience, truly, so I don't understand why I feel the way I do right now.\n\n Sorry for such a long post. \n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit 2: Another thing I should mention is that around the same time I began telling myself that my brain was an organ like all the others in my body, and that when a body part is strained by overactivity, poor diet, dehydration, etc., it suffers. This could also be what caused me some relief, but this thought was spurred by the email from my professor.

Thank you for your time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prelude&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the hardest part of living with mental illness is that our success with it is judged on how well we hide it.  It\u2019s not the absence of the illness.  There is no possibility of the absence of the fundamental neurology that is the basis of the illness.  It\u2019s learning how to pretend that we\u2019re ok, how to play the game of what is acceptable for society to see and what is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good employee stays the good employee.  They just avoid deep personal conversations and wait to find a private place to release the tension.  The good parent continues to try to be a good parent.  They just wait until the shower is running or the kids are in bed to cry.  We keep trying, because we have no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have yet to meet a person with mental illness that doesn\u2019t have some nearly unbelievable tale of how they were treated as a direct result of their mental illness.  There is a constant dismissiveness from society.  We are viewed as violent, stupid, and weak.  Our legitimate experiences are turned into nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been told that my grieving process that happened after my father died wasn\u2019t grieving, it was just a product of my mental illness.  I have been told that my legitimate worry and anxiety from not making enough to pay my bills wasn\u2019t legitimate, that it was just a product of my mental illness.  You name the perfectly natural emotional reaction, ranging the spectrum from happiness to anger and frustration, and at one point or another, it has been blamed on my mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I hide it.  It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not still living with it.  But I hide for survival.  I hide because I don\u2019t want normal reactions blamed on it.  I hide because I still have responsibilities to take care of.  I hide because I have to keep going.  There are others counting on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, my family and I moved to a new part of town. There was a farm down the road from us. On the farm, they had a zebra. For a couple of years, whenever my family and I would drive by, I would comment on the zebra. My mother would respond, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no zebra. You&amp;#39;re just crazy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, she was looking that direction as we drove by one day. She said, &amp;quot;Oh my god! There&amp;#39;s a zebra!&amp;quot; I said, from the back seat with a voice filled with resentment and barely controlled rage, &amp;quot;REALLY!?! I just thought I was crazy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mental illness is like that. The reality of the zebra doesn&amp;#39;t matter if no one&amp;#39;s willing to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that we all have a longing for at least one person to genuinely know and understand our tales.  I think that we all have a longing for our voices to matter enough to be heard.  I think we all want to be known, not necessarily in the sense of fame, but more in the sense of human connection.  We want to know that our experiences in life matter, that we are simply humans worthy and deserving of respect and dignity and humanity.  Whether it\u2019s with a life partner, or a group of friends, or with the world at large, we want to be known.  We want to know when we leave this veil of tears, that at least one person will remember us for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are my tales.  I am showing you my zebra.  Whether or not you believe in it\u2019s reality is up to you.  I will not argue it.  I just know that these are the tales of my reality.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginnings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could say that it started when I was an adolescent.  Technically, that was my formal presentation.  It\u2019s when the symptoms started happening.  But the truth of the matter is that it wasn\u2019t where it started.  It started when a sperm met an egg, forming a zygote.  It started at conception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Genetics and the environment in the womb control the initial neurological development of the child.  This is true for anyone, not just people with mental illnesses.  For people with a wide range of neurological conditions with genetic roots, the development is different.  One section may be bigger.  Another may be smaller.  One may turn hyper reactive.  One may turn sluggish and slow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was always an observant child.  Always.  I learned very early on, years before my illness formally presented that my reactions to the same stimulus were different than my peers.  My reactions were much more variable and less predictable.  I was quicker to jump to a fight or flight response.  I was quicker to bigger expressions of emotion.  It would take me decades to learn how to temper and control the expression of my emotions down to socially acceptable levels.  It changes nothing about how I feel them.  It changes how I allow myself to show them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like any child, I lacked the emotional language to explain the difference.   However, I felt it every day.  There has never been a time in my life where I haven\u2019t felt like an outsider.  It has always felt as though I were either lacking in something necessary for standard success or cursed with too much of whatever else to make it through.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was twelve when I formally presented.  I was twelve when the symptoms became a daily part of my life.  Just a baby.  Like any other girl that age, I was trying to figure out the whole boy/girl thing, in the middle of my first major crush, trying to figure out the struggles of puberty.  I had all the normal things going on that any other twelve-year old\u2019s go through.  It\u2019s not as though having a mental illness means that all those things stop.  It\u2019s just that you have the additional struggles of trying to figure out something that takes years to define.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "*I am mostly looking for a couple of people to read this and let me know whether or not they think I need to keep writing.  Thank you for your time*\n\nPrelude\n\nI think the hardest part of living with mental illness is that our success with it is judged on how well we hide it.  It\u2019s not the absence of the illness.  There is no possibility of the absence of the fundamental neurology that is the basis of the illness.  It\u2019s learning how to pretend that we\u2019re ok, how to play the game of what is acceptable for society to see and what is unacceptable.\n\nThe good employee stays the good employee.  They just avoid deep personal conversations and wait to find a private place to release the tension.  The good parent continues to try to be a good parent.  They just wait until the shower is running or the kids are in bed to cry.  We keep trying, because we have no other choice.\n\nI have yet to meet a person with mental illness that doesn\u2019t have some nearly unbelievable tale of how they were treated as a direct result of their mental illness.  There is a constant dismissiveness from society.  We are viewed as violent, stupid, and weak.  Our legitimate experiences are turned into nothing.  \n\nI have been told that my grieving process that happened after my father died wasn\u2019t grieving, it was just a product of my mental illness.  I have been told that my legitimate worry and anxiety from not making enough to pay my bills wasn\u2019t legitimate, that it was just a product of my mental illness.  You name the perfectly natural emotional reaction, ranging the spectrum from happiness to anger and frustration, and at one point or another, it has been blamed on my mental illness.\n\nAnd so I hide it.  It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not still living with it.  But I hide for survival.  I hide because I don\u2019t want normal reactions blamed on it.  I hide because I still have responsibilities to take care of.  I hide because I have to keep going.  There are others counting on me.\n\nMany years ago, my family and I moved to a new part of town.

(22.07.2017 18:05.) I was sitting on my laptop working on my new marketing strategy. Life was awesome. I opened my facebook to see what is happening. \n...The news about Chester&amp;#39;s Bennington suicide came and hit me in the face. I started having intrusive thoughts about suicide accompanied by a dark feeling and distorted vision which made them seem so real. I opened google.com and started researching. The first results were &amp;#39;Major Depressive Disorder&amp;#39;, I looked at the symptoms and discovered that I am fine. Then I checked some OCD article and it said &amp;#39;People with OCD have 10 times higher chance of commiting suicide&amp;#39;. I became even more terrified, the thoughts started to seem even more real. Random feeling of &amp;#39;Life is pointless&amp;#39; came. I became even more terrified.\nI went back home, my vision was still distorted and I felt lile vomiting. \nNow 4 months later, \nit feels like I completely changed. I am constantly anxious(Even can&amp;#39;t tell If I am anxious, like constant doubt. Can&amp;#39;t get out of my head.

(22.07.2017 18:05.) I was sitting on my laptop working on my new marketing strategy. Life was awesome. I opened my facebook to see what is happening. \n...The news about Chester's Bennington suicide came and hit me in the face. I started having intrusive thoughts about suicide accompanied by a dark feeling and distorted vision which made them seem so real. I opened google.com and started researching. The first results were 'Major Depressive Disorder', I looked at the symptoms and discovered that I am fine. Then I checked some OCD article and it said 'People with OCD have 10 times higher chance of commiting suicide'. I became even more terrified, the thoughts started to seem even more real. Random feeling of 'Life is pointless' came. I became even more terrified.\nI went back home, my vision was still distorted and I felt lile vomiting. \nNow 4 months later, \nit feels like I completely changed.

He&amp;#39;s a relatively well adjusted, functioning member of society - manages a small business, has a house, wife and his first baby girl is due in about a week or so - and although we&amp;#39;ve joked he might be a high functioning sociopath, he seemed and acted relatively normal. He told us that he sought psychiatric help last week after about a year of dealing with what he referred to as &amp;#39;episodes&amp;#39; during which he would have problems concentrating, have very paranoid feelings and have the inability to both read text and remember - at least consciously - how to operate various complex machines (phones, vehicles, computers, etc) but if he didn&amp;#39;t think about them would be able to drive, type, etc. He said these last for somewhere between a few days to as many as a few weeks at a time, during which he has long term memory issues and has problems recalling details during the episodes. He took to writing in a journal during the episodes in order to help remember what happened and catalog his thoughts, after reviewing these with his very supportive wife, he decided to seek professional help. He outlined this with us and referenced some times he had been with our group of friends during these episodes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that background out of the way, here are my questions and concerns.

I don&amp;#39;t have any sort of judgmental stigma towards him or see him as a different person as a result of this still formative diagnosis, I mostly am just looking for information in order to be prepared on how to best help him during or after one of these episodes. Obviously the best person to talk to is him and we had a pretty length heart to heart with him as a group about how no one thinks less of him, that we&amp;#39;re all still very close friends and asked for clear cut steps on what to do and what not to do during these episodes, but as he pointed out, he has trouble remembering them, gets VERY paranoid during them and has trouble reading text and articulating thoughts.

This definition is present in the article of Mario May, a well-known psychiatrist, later - president of the World Psychiatric Association [2].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Varieties of conflict of interest in psychiatry&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bias in conducting studies, publishing their results and analyzing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reasons and methods of forming a financial alliance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Examples&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varieties of conflict of interest in psychiatry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A financial conflict of interest, according to M. May, is a conflict between interests related to the well-being of the patient or the development of science, and secondary interests associated with the desire to obtain financial benefits for themselves or their institution. The subject of financial conflict in authoritative sources was often considered, and mainly those types of this conflict that arise as a result of the interaction of psychiatrists with firms producing drugs. [1] &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M. May also mentions cases of the existence of a financial conflict of another kind: the sources of financial conflicts in these cases are not the relationship of psychiatrists with pharmaco-firms, but (again paid) their relationships with various public or private agencies: for example, a lawyer&amp;#39;s office. M. May also points out the existence of non-financial conflicts of interest : the devotion of the researcher to the kind of treatment that he is engaged in, or, for example, the presence of an interest reflecting the political predilections of the psychiatrist. [1]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bias in research, publication of their results and analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Highly authoritative sources on evidence-based standards in the treatment of depression and other mental disorders have identified problems such as:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;an explicit and implicit influence of the legitimate interests of research sponsors on its results, leading to the fact that the results of Phase III studies are often questionable [3] &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the constant tendency to publicize only positive results of research, hiding and concealing negative ones [4] [5][3] - works with positive results are twice as likely to be published (as a rule, in more prestigious and correspondingly more cited publications ); there is a tendency to repeatedly publish the same results, differently decorated [4];&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;use in meta-analyzes only the most favorable research results [4];&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;distortion of the essence of the data obtained using scientific papers [4];&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;original articles are often just a retelling of other sources, and only those publications that support certain conclusions are mentioned, so the list of sources in scientific reports often creates the wrong idea of \u200b\u200ba much larger number of studies than was actually done [4] .&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mario May notes: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, I have seen clearly biased clinical guidelines and biased reviews and editorial articles; I know of several cases of publishing falsifications (that is, the publication of research reports, chapters of books or editorial articles signed by researchers but actually carried out by pharmaco-firms), and I have heard of several cases of selective attitude towards the publication of research results [1].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to statements made by government investigators and lawyers of plaintiffs (in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies), many research articles about antipsychotics (neuroleptics) were considered in marketing departments of pharmaco companies, ghostwritten and then signed by well-known doctors - and this created the illusion that doctors carried out their research independently of each other (The New York Times, 2010). [6]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons and methods of forming a financial alliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;American doctor M. Angell notes that when some states enacted glasnost laws requiring that pharmaceutical companies report all payments to doctors, it turned out that psychiatrists receive more money from pharmaceutical companies than doctors of any other specialty. Approximately one fifth of the funding of the American Psychiatric Association comes from pharmaceutical companies. [7]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among the reasons for this state of affairs, which M. Angell (and also D. Carlat, whose book &amp;quot;The Mistaken&amp;quot; is referred to by Angell), calls the following: [7]\nPsychiatry is a specialty that intensively uses medicines;\nthe subjectivity of diagnoses in psychiatry and the possibility of expanding diagnostic boundaries;\nAbsence of objective signs for mental diseases, laboratory data or findings on MRI , which allow correctly diagnose;\nThere are no rational reasons for preferring one medication to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As M. Angell writes, psychiatrists often receive attention and generous rewards from pharmaceutical companies, individually and collectively, directly and indirectly: gifts, free samples, fees for employment of psychiatrists as consultants and speakers, food for psychiatrists, payment for participation in conferences, and also supply with &amp;quot;educational&amp;quot; materials. The pharmaceutical industry sponsors meetings of the American Psychiatric Association and other psychiatric conferences. [7]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1998, in a letter to Rodrigo Munoza, president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), Lauren Mosher, an American psychiatrist, expert on schizophrenia treatment, and founder of the Soteria project, said: At this point in history, in my view, psychiatry has been almost completely bought out by the drug companies. The APA could not continue without the pharmaceutical company support of meetings, symposia, workshops, journal advertising, grand rounds luncheons, unrestricted educational grants etc. etc. Psychiatrists have become the minions of drug company promotions. APA, of course, maintains that its independence and autonomy are not compromised in this enmeshed situation. Anyone with the least bit of common sense attending the annual meeting would observe how the drug company exhibits and \u201cindustry sponsored symposia\u201d draw crowds with their various enticements, while the serious scientific sessions are barely attended. Psychiatric training reflects their influence as well: the most important part of a resident\u2019s curriculum is the art and quasi-science of dealing drugs, i.e., prescription writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lauren Mosher, Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder (English) note that at the meetings of the APA there are numerous exhibitions, events with food, drinks and various entertainments, such as musical performances, all financed by pharmaceutical companies. These authors also point out that the pharmaceutical companies provide support to almost all organizations involved in the field of psychiatric care [9].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to L. Mosher, R. Gosden and S. Beder, the most successful means of marketing pharmaceutical companies is probably direct personal contact of doctors and implementers of drugs (sales representatives). In addition, doctors are provided with carefully filtered information, advertising materials and samples of products produced by companies. Pharmaceutical companies also support research conducted at universities, and without this support, many departments of psychiatry, apparently, could not exist. With data from clinical trials funded by the same companies, the pharmaceutical companies decide which of these information should be published, selects authors, writes for them, and reviews these articles in order to present the information in the most beneficial form [9].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the implementation of counter-criticism, as noted by L. Mosher, R. Gosden and S. Beder, prominent representatives of academic circles and scientists are hired, who are more difficult to suspect of bias than workers of pharmaceutical companies. Authors who criticize the activities of pharmaceutical companies are discredited and persecuted by their colleagues, who receive some compensation from companies for this or that measure. The financing of publications that publish materials that are unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies is being stopped. There have been cases of suing the investigators who published negative reviews of the results of clinical trials paid by these companies [9].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Director of the Law, Ethics and Psychiatry Section at Columbia University Paul Appelbaum (English), former head of the American Psychiatric Association, said at an annual meeting of APA that by the third year of medical schooling, 94% of future psychiatrists became holders of &amp;quot;small, unrelated gifts or received invitations to dinner&amp;quot; from pharmaceutical companies [10].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In many meta-analytical surveys, mention is made of the possibility of distortion of information in studies in favor of atypical antipsychotics. S. Ahmer, P. Arya analyzed the dependence of the outcome of RCTs on the study of the effectiveness of antipsychotics from funding sources and found that in studies funded by pharmaceutical companies, the results were more reliably obtained in favor of the new drug. It is also characteristic to silence the negative results of the action of atypical antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2006, an article was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, whose authors (S. Heres, J. Davis, K. Maino, E. Jetzinger, etc.) analyzed 42 publications on randomized controlled trials comparing atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole, amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole and ziprasidone. 32 of these 43 trials were fully or partially funded by pharmaceutical companies. The study revealed a correlation between sponsorship support and the findings outlined in the abstracts of publications; in 90% of cases in publications the conclusion was made about the superiority of the drug, produced by the testing company, over other drugs. As a result, different comparisons of the same antipsychotic drugs led to contradictory conclusions, depending on the sponsorship of the studies. As the authors noted, the results of the tests could be influenced by differences in dosages of drugs and increasing doses, the criteria for including patients in trials and other features of clinical trials leading to biased results [13].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the same year, an article was published in Psychological Medicine, whose authors (RE Kelly, LJ Cohen, RJ Semple, P. Bialer, and others) reviewed the clinical trials of all drugs used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders published in four peer-reviewed psychiatric journals from 1992 to 2002 (542 of which totaled 542), found that the percentage of research sponsored by pharmaceutical companies increased from 25% in 1992 to 57% in 2002. It also turned out that positive results were much more frequent in studies sponsored by the manufacturers of the drugs being tested than in studies that were not financed by pharmaceutical companies or financed by competitors of pharmaceutical companies that produce the drugs under study. In studies sponsored by manufacturers of test drugs, positive results were obtained in 78% of cases, in studies that were not funded by pharmaceutical companies - in 48%, and in financed by competitors - in 28% of cases [14].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is B. Vastag, a reporter for The Washington Post, in his blog on the newspaper&amp;#39;s website. In order to receive approval for the use of eight atypical antipsychotics , 24 studies were conducted - but four of these studies were not published in professional journals, and all four were not in favor of the drugs. Three of the unpublished studies showed that new drugs do not work better than placebo ; two of these three concerned abiliphia (aripiprazole), and one - geodona (ziprasidona) [15].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the British newspaper The Independent reported that Harvard University (USA) was at the center of a scientific and political scandal after three well-known employees of the Department of Psychiatry were convicted of violating the law on the conflict of interest without having declared millions of dollars, received from pharmaceutical companies as fees for consultations. So, the world-famous children&amp;#39;s psychiatrist Joseph Biderman, whose merit is a sharp increase in the use of potent neuroleptics, did not deem it necessary to inform the university management of at least 1.6 million US dollars received from the manufacturers of these drugs; two of his colleagues also did not disclose their fees of $1.6 million and $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Harvard scientists and pharmaco companies is a long-standing topic of debate, as their studies gave impetus to the previously banned use of antipsychotics in pediatrics [16].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, as reported by The New York Times, J. Biderman&amp;#39;s research on the prevalence of bipolar affective disorder in children led to an increase in the diagnosis of this disease in childhood. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson paid more than $ 700,000 to the research center headed by Dr. Biderman from 2002 to 2005 , and some of his work advertises the neuroleptic risperidone (risperdal), which is manufactured by this company [6].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1999, as noted by The Washington Post, AstraZeneca, the manufacturer of neuroleptic seroquel (quetiapine), presented data at a conference of the American Psychiatric Association and at a psychiatric conference in Europe; in the conclusion of these reports it was stated that quetiapine helps patients suffering from psychosis to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This conclusion is made on the basis of a sponsored AstraZeneca study conducted by a Chicago psychiatrist who has studied reports on 65 patients transferred to seroquel. Nevertheless, the documents show that AstraZeneca did not fully trust the methods of this psychiatrist and treated him without deep respect. In 1997, according to the results of the study, which was called &amp;quot;Study 15&amp;quot;, it became known that quetiapine causes a clinically dangerous weight gain, but the data of this study were hidden by the company. Details of the Study 15 were found in trials that suggest that seroquel was the cause of weight gain, development of hyperglycemia and diabetes in thousands of patients who took it [17].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Against Eli Lilly and Company, a pharmaceutical company manufacturing neuroleptic ziprexa (olanzapine), lawsuits were filed in connection with the advertising of the drug for its misuse and in connection with the concealment of certain side effects (hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus) [18]. Knowing the risk of weight gain in patients, the company nevertheless minimized the link between ziprex and obesity in the widely circulated video &amp;quot;Myth of Diabetes&amp;quot;, which used the results of studies of questionable quality and honesty and false reporting of side effects [19].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company paid more than a billion dollars to settle lawsuits on ziprexa [18]. British psychiatrist, professor of psychological medicine at the University of Cardiff David Healy mentioned the carefully hidden research data on the use of ziprex, according to which this drug has the highest suicide rate in the history of clinical trials [10].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reporting on his unsuccessful attempts to publish silenced data on clinical trials in journals that refused to publish it, David Healy noted that, according to these data, the risk of suicide in taking antidepressants is much higher than previously indicated in open sources [10].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a commentary to the report of the CINP Working Group (Collegium Internationale NeuroPsychopharmacologicum), &amp;quot;Therapy with antidepressants and other methods of treating depressive disorders,&amp;quot; D. Healy wrote: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The report endorses the position that a relatively modest advantage over placebo in the selected number of clinical studies means that antidepressants work. &amp;lt;...&amp;gt; Studies always select; a large number of studies demonstrating only a minor or even lack of antidepressant benefits over placebo have been published and, accordingly, declared for certain indications. &amp;lt;...&amp;gt; ... The approach seems to be false, when out of 10 patients take 5 responding to these antidepressants and compare with 4 responding to placebo, assessing the advantage according to the rating scale, and conclude that the drug works. When a 50% response to antidepressants is compared against a 40% response to a placebo, do not take into account that the response to an antidepressant in 80% of cases depends on nonspecific factors. We are not able to quantify the contribution of various nonspecific factors, while we readily quantify the specific effects of drugs. Meanwhile, it reflects only 20% of the specific answer. And for someone, the money and culture that has developed in psychiatry can serve as the basis for a demonstrative judgment in favor of 80%, not 20% success [3].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David Healy also points out that antidepressants can be approved for use by drug regulators, even if only 2 trials out of 100 showed the effectiveness of a particular drug. In large trials, even a small difference between the main group and the placebo group can be statistically significant [20].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peter G\u00f6tsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, professor of design and analysis of clinical research at the University of Copenhagen, author of more than 70 articles in leading medical journals such as the British Medical Journal and The Lancet, questions the quality of clinical trials of the effectiveness of antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He notes that in a number of studies, placebo was different from the active drug in terms of physical characteristics, such as texture, color and thickness; that placebo in the vast majority of studies on the action of antidepressants had no side effects (eg, dry mouth), with the exception of the rare cases when atropine was used as a placebo, and because of the absence of side effects, patients in the studies could suspect that they were not taking the medicine but placebo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to G\u00f6tsche&amp;#39;s conclusions, the true difference in improvement with antidepressants and placebo seems to be significantly less than the 10 percent reported in official research results, as there is evidence that a double-blind study in which blinding is inadequate can lead to a very significant exaggeration of the effectiveness of drugs [19].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;G\u00f6tzsche also mentions that bias in the prozac-sponsored trials of prozac (fluoxetine) is very high: in direct comparative trials, where this drug was the main subject of the study, a significantly larger number of patients became better off from it than in trials in which Prozac was a comparator that is, it was used for comparison) [19].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Irving Kirsch (English), a well-known American psychologist, having analyzed a number of clinical studies of antidepressants (including those of them whose data were not printed, because they received undesirable results), found that the results of most studies are negative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The median difference between the drugs and the placebo was only 1.8 on the Hamilton scale (widely used for assessing the symptoms of depression), although the difference was significant statistically, but clinically meaningless. However, since studies with positive results have been widely published, and studies with negative results have been hiding, the public and medical professionals have come to believe that these drugs are highly effective antidepressants [21].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2008, an analysis (Turner and co-authors) of both published and unpublished studies on the effects of 12 antidepressants was conducted; data from these studies were provided to the authors of the analysis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was found that 94% of previously published trials showed an antidepressant benefit compared with placebo; However, after reviewing the results of both published and unpublished trials, Turner and co-authors found that only about 51% of them show an advantage compared to placebo. Of the 74 studies reviewed, only 38 had positive results, and almost all of them were published. Studies with negative or questionable results were mostly unpublished (22 studies), or published with distortion of results, as a result of which they appeared as positive (11 studies) [22].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Statistics specialist Hans Melander and his colleagues from the Swedish Medicines Agency in 2003 showed that published articles on trials of SSRI antidepressants contain significant distortions compared to data on studies provided in registration applications sent to the agency. In all 42 studies that were submitted to the agency, except for one, the company performed both an intentional analysis and an analysis according to the protocol (which does not include patients who dropped out of the study). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, in only two publications of the results of the studies, both analyzes were present, but in the remaining cases only a more favorable analysis was provided - analysis according to the protocol. This created a false impression on the readers about the effectiveness of the drugs. In addition, individual tests were sometimes published as if they were the same test, there were no cross-references to numerous publications of the same trial; sometimes there were no surnames of authors, common to all publications [19].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 29 published and 11 unpublished clinical trials (authors of the review - C. Barbui, T. Furukawa, A. Cipriani, 2008) showed that one of the most popular and often prescribed antidepressants - paroxetine does not exceed placebo in terms of overall efficacy and tolerability of treatment. These results were not distorted by selective selection of published studies [23].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In connection with the increased risk of suicide against the background of taking paroxetine, several dozens of lawsuits were filed against the manufacturer of this drug GlaxoSmithKline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lawyers of the affected parties managed to gain access to the internal documentation of the company and to draw as a result of its study the conclusion that GlaxoSmithKline as early as 1989 had information about an eightfold increase in the risk of suicide when taking its drugs [24].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, the risk of suicide and suicidal tendencies in the use of SSRIs is much higher than reported by pharmaceutical companies. So, at least three companies: GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Company and Pfizer - added suicide and suicide attempts to the placebo group in clinical trials if they occurred before patients were randomized into groups. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, cases of suicidal thoughts and actions in the results of clinical trials are often referred to as &amp;quot;emotional lability&amp;quot;. Often, events related to suicidal intentions caused by the drug were not recorded if they occurred shortly after the withdrawal of SSRIs; Finally, data on many studies that showed undesirable results were completely hidden [19].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to M. May, the unpleasant tendencies that he notes in the study of bipolar disorders are biased in favor of new drugs compared with traditional ones (mainly lithium): in some studies, the level of lithium in the blood was too low, and therefore it is not surprising that these patients had worse treatment outcomes than those who received new psychotropic drugs; several clinical trial reports focused on the secondary properties of the drugs (eg, no side effects), resulting in studies that were evaluated as positive, although the primary effect of the drug was not different from placebo [1].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M. May also mentions that The Lancet publicized one of the cases of a financial conflict of the opposite kind: it turned out that the author of the articl\u0443 which found a link between vaccination against measles and rubella and several cases of autism, had financial ties with a law firm that A lawsuit in favor of children allegedly affected by vaccination [1].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maj, M.

Corresponding English-language article does not exist. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Conflict of interest in psychiatry is the situation when a psychiatrist is unduly influenced by any circumstances that are secondary to his professional activity (to the well-being of his patients, to the development of science, and if he is a researcher, to the education of hist students if he is a teacher) [1]. This definition is present in the article of Mario May, a well-known psychiatrist, later - president of the World Psychiatric Association [2].\n\n**Contents**\n\n1. Varieties of conflict of interest in psychiatry\n2. Bias in conducting studies, publishing their results and analyzing\n3. Reasons and methods of forming a financial alliance\n4. Examples\n\n**Varieties of conflict of interest in psychiatry**\n\nA financial conflict of interest, according to M. May, is a conflict between interests related to the well-being of the patient or the development of science, and secondary interests associated with the desire to obtain financial benefits for themselves or their institution. The subject of financial conflict in authoritative sources was often considered, and mainly those types of this conflict that arise as a result of the interaction of psychiatrists with firms producing drugs. [1] \n \nM. May also mentions cases of the existence of a financial conflict of another kind: the sources of financial conflicts in these cases are not the relationship of psychiatrists with pharmaco-firms, but (again paid) their relationships with various public or private agencies: for example, a lawyer's office. M. May also points out the existence of non-financial conflicts of interest : the devotion of the researcher to the kind of treatment that he is engaged in, or, for example, the presence of an interest reflecting the political predilections of the psychiatrist. [1]\n\n**Bias in research, publication of their results and analysis**\n\nHighly authoritative sources on evidence-based standards in the treatment of depression and other mental disorders have identified problems such as:\n\n* an explicit and implicit influence of the legitimate interests of research sponsors on its results, leading to the fact that the results of Phase III studies are often questionable [3] \n* the constant tendency to publicize only positive results of research, hiding and concealing negative ones [4] [5][3] - works with positive results are twice as likely to be published (as a rule, in more prestigious and correspondingly more cited publications ); there is a tendency to repeatedly publish the same results, differently decorated [4];\n* use in meta-analyzes only the most favorable research results [4];\n* distortion of the essence of the data obtained using scientific papers [4];\n* original articles are often just a retelling of other sources, and only those publications that support certain conclusions are mentioned, so the list of sources in scientific reports often creates the wrong idea of \u200b\u200ba much larger number of studies than was actually done [4] .\n\n\nMario May notes: \n&gt; In the past few years, I have seen clearly biased clinical guidelines and biased reviews and editorial articles; I know of several cases of publishing falsifications (that is, the publication of research reports, chapters of books or editorial articles signed by researchers but actually carried out by pharmaco-firms), and I have heard of several cases of selective attitude towards the publication of research results [1].\n\n\nAccording to statements made by government investigators and lawyers of plaintiffs (in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies), many research articles about antipsychotics (neuroleptics) were considered in marketing departments of pharmaco companies, ghostwritten and then signed by well-known doctors - and this created the illusion that doctors carried out their research independently of each other (The New York Times, 2010). [6]\n\n**Reasons and methods of forming a financial alliance**\n\nAmerican doctor M. Angell notes that when some states enacted glasnost laws requiring that pharmaceutical companies report all payments to doctors, it turned out that psychiatrists receive more money from pharmaceutical companies than doctors of any other specialty. Approximately one fifth of the funding of the American Psychiatric Association comes from pharmaceutical companies. [7]\n\n\nAmong the reasons for this state of affairs, which M. Angell (and also D. Carlat, whose book \"The Mistaken\" is referred to by Angell), calls the following: [7]\nPsychiatry is a specialty that intensively uses medicines;\nthe subjectivity of diagnoses in psychiatry and the possibility of expanding diagnostic boundaries;\nAbsence of objective signs for mental diseases, laboratory data or findings on MRI , which allow correctly diagnose;\nThere are no rational reasons for preferring one medication to another.\n\n\nAs M. Angell writes, psychiatrists often receive attention and generous rewards from pharmaceutical companies, individually and collectively, directly and indirectly: gifts, free samples, fees for employment of psychiatrists as consultants and speakers, food for psychiatrists, payment for participation in conferences, and also supply with \"educational\" materials. The pharmaceutical industry sponsors meetings of the American Psychiatric Association and other psychiatric conferences. [7]\n\n\nIn 1998, in a letter to Rodrigo Munoza, president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), Lauren Mosher, an American psychiatrist, expert on schizophrenia treatment, and founder of the Soteria project, said: At this point in history, in my view, psychiatry has been almost completely bought out by the drug companies. The APA could not continue without the pharmaceutical company support of meetings, symposia, workshops, journal advertising, grand rounds luncheons, unrestricted educational grants etc. etc. Psychiatrists have become the minions of drug company promotions. APA, of course, maintains that its independence and autonomy are not compromised in this enmeshed situation. Anyone with the least bit of common sense attending the annual meeting would observe how the drug company exhibits and \u201cindustry sponsored symposia\u201d draw crowds with their various enticements, while the serious scientific sessions are barely attended. Psychiatric training reflects their influence as well: the most important part of a resident\u2019s curriculum is the art and quasi-science of dealing drugs, i.e., prescription writing.\n\n\nLauren Mosher, Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder (English) note that at the meetings of the APA there are numerous exhibitions, events with food, drinks and various entertainments, such as musical performances, all financed by pharmaceutical companies. These authors also point out that the pharmaceutical companies provide support to almost all organizations involved in the field of psychiatric care [9].\n\n\nAccording to L. Mosher, R. Gosden and S. Beder, the most successful means of marketing pharmaceutical companies is probably direct personal contact of doctors and implementers of drugs (sales representatives). In addition, doctors are provided with carefully filtered information, advertising materials and samples of products produced by companies. Pharmaceutical companies also support research conducted at universities, and without this support, many departments of psychiatry, apparently, could not exist. With data from clinical trials funded by the same companies, the pharmaceutical companies decide which of these information should be published, selects authors, writes for them, and reviews these articles in order to present the information in the most beneficial form [9].\n\n\nFor the implementation of counter-criticism, as noted by L. Mosher, R. Gosden and S. Beder, prominent representatives of academic circles and scientists are hired, who are more difficult to suspect of bias than workers of pharmaceutical companies. Authors who criticize the activities of pharmaceutical companies are discredited and persecuted by their colleagues, who receive some compensation from companies for this or that measure. The financing of publications that publish materials that are unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies is being stopped. There have been cases of suing the investigators who published negative reviews of the results of clinical trials paid by these companies [9].\n\n\nDirector of the Law, Ethics and Psychiatry Section at Columbia University Paul Appelbaum (English), former head of the American Psychiatric Association, said at an annual meeting of APA that by the third year of medical schooling, 94% of future psychiatrists became holders of \"small, unrelated gifts or received invitations to dinner\" from pharmaceutical companies [10].\n\n\n**Examples**\n \nIn many meta-analytical surveys, mention is made of the possibility of distortion of information in studies in favor of atypical antipsychotics. S. Ahmer, P. Arya analyzed the dependence of the outcome of RCTs on the study of the effectiveness of antipsychotics from funding sources and found that in studies funded by pharmaceutical companies, the results were more reliably obtained in favor of the new drug. It is also characteristic to silence the negative results of the action of atypical antipsychotics.\n \nIn 2006, an article was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, whose authors (S. Heres, J. Davis, K. Maino, E. Jetzinger, etc.) analyzed 42 publications on randomized controlled trials comparing atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole, amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole and ziprasidone. 32 of these 43 trials were fully or partially funded by pharmaceutical companies. The study revealed a correlation between sponsorship support and the findings outlined in the abstracts of publications; in 90% of cases in publications the conclusion was made about the superiority of the drug, produced by the testing company, over other drugs. As a result, different comparisons of the same antipsychotic drugs led to contradictory conclusions, depending on the sponsorship of the studies. As the authors noted, the results of the tests could be influenced by differences in dosages of drugs and increasing doses, the criteria for including patients in trials and other features of clinical trials leading to biased results [13].\n \nIn the same year, an article was published in Psychological Medicine, whose authors (RE Kelly, LJ Cohen, RJ Semple, P. Bialer, and others) reviewed the clinical trials of all drugs used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders published in four peer-reviewed psychiatric journals from 1992 to 2002 (542 of which totaled 542), found that the percentage of research sponsored by pharmaceutical companies increased from 25% in 1992 to 57% in 2002. It also turned out that positive results were much more frequent in studies sponsored by the manufacturers of the drugs being tested than in studies that were not financed by pharmaceutical companies or financed by competitors of pharmaceutical companies that produce the drugs under study. In studies sponsored by manufacturers of test drugs, positive results were obtained in 78% of cases, in studies that were not funded by pharmaceutical companies - in 48%, and in financed by competitors - in 28% of cases [14].\n \nAnother example is B. Vastag, a reporter for The Washington Post, in his blog on the newspaper's website. In order to receive approval for the use of eight atypical antipsychotics , 24 studies were conducted - but four of these studies were not published in professional journals, and all four were not in favor of the drugs. Three of the unpublished studies showed that new drugs do not work better than placebo ; two of these three concerned abiliphia (aripiprazole), and one - geodona (ziprasidona) [15].\n \nIn 2008, the British newspaper The Independent reported that Harvard University (USA) was at the center of a scientific and political scandal after three well-known employees of the Department of Psychiatry were convicted of violating the law on the conflict of interest without having declared millions of dollars, received from pharmaceutical companies as fees for consultations. So, the world-famous children's psychiatrist Joseph Biderman, whose merit is a sharp increase in the use of potent neuroleptics, did not deem it necessary to inform the university management of at least 1.6 million US dollars received from the manufacturers of these drugs; two of his colleagues also did not disclose their fees of $1.6 million and $1 million. \n \nThe relationship between Harvard scientists and pharmaco companies is a long-standing topic of debate, as their studies gave impetus to the previously banned use of antipsychotics in pediatrics [16].\n \nIn particular, as reported by The New York Times, J. Biderman's research on the prevalence of bipolar affective disorder in children led to an increase in the diagnosis of this disease in childhood. Johnson &amp; Johnson paid more than $ 700,000 to the research center headed by Dr. Biderman from 2002 to 2005 , and some of his work advertises the neuroleptic risperidone (risperdal), which is manufactured by this company [6].\n \nIn 1999, as noted by The Washington Post, AstraZeneca, the manufacturer of neuroleptic seroquel (quetiapine), presented data at a conference of the American Psychiatric Association and at a psychiatric conference in Europe; in the conclusion of these reports it was stated that quetiapine helps patients suffering from psychosis to lose weight.\n \nThis conclusion is made on the basis of a sponsored AstraZeneca study conducted by a Chicago psychiatrist who has studied reports on 65 patients transferred to seroquel. Nevertheless, the documents show that AstraZeneca did not fully trust the methods of this psychiatrist and treated him without deep respect. In 1997, according to the results of the study, which was called \"Study 15\", it became known that quetiapine causes a clinically dangerous weight gain, but the data of this study were hidden by the company. Details of the Study 15 were found in trials that suggest that seroquel was the cause of weight gain, development of hyperglycemia and diabetes in thousands of patients who took it [17].\n \nAgainst Eli Lilly and Company, a pharmaceutical company manufacturing neuroleptic ziprexa (olanzapine), lawsuits were filed in connection with the advertising of the drug for its misuse and in connection with the concealment of certain side effects (hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus) [18]. Knowing the risk of weight gain in patients, the company nevertheless minimized the link between ziprex and obesity in the widely circulated video \"Myth of Diabetes\", which used the results of studies of questionable quality and honesty and false reporting of side effects [19].\n \nThe company paid more than a billion dollars to settle lawsuits on ziprexa [18]. British psychiatrist, professor of psychological medicine at the University of Cardiff David Healy mentioned the carefully hidden research data on the use of ziprex, according to which this drug has the highest suicide rate in the history of clinical trials [10].\n \nReporting on his unsuccessful attempts to publish silenced data on clinical trials in journals that refused to publish it, David Healy noted that, according to these data, the risk of suicide in taking antidepressants is much higher than previously indicated in open sources [10].\n \nIn a commentary to the report of the CINP Working Group (Collegium Internationale NeuroPsychopharmacologicum), \"Therapy with antidepressants and other methods of treating depressive disorders,\" D. Healy wrote: \n&gt;The report endorses the position that a relatively modest advantage over placebo in the selected number of clinical studies means that antidepressants work. &lt;...&gt; Studies always select; a large number of studies demonstrating only a minor or even lack of antidepressant benefits over placebo have been published and, accordingly, declared for certain indications. &lt;...&gt; ... The approach seems to be false, when out of 10 patients take 5 responding to these antidepressants and compare with 4 responding to placebo, assessing the advantage according to the rating scale, and conclude that the drug works. When a 50% response to antidepressants is compared against a 40% response to a placebo, do not take into account that the response to an antidepressant in 80% of cases depends on nonspecific factors. We are not able to quantify the contribution of various nonspecific factors, while we readily quantify the specific effects of drugs. Meanwhile, it reflects only 20% of the specific answer. And for someone, the money and culture that has developed in psychiatry can serve as the basis for a demonstrative judgment in favor of 80%, not 20% success [3].\n \nDavid Healy also points out that antidepressants can be approved for use by drug regulators, even if only 2 trials out of 100 showed the effectiveness of a particular drug. In large trials, even a small difference between the main group and the placebo group can be statistically significant [20].\n \nPeter G\u00f6tsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, professor of design and analysis of clinical research at the University of Copenhagen, author of more than 70 articles in leading medical journals such as the British Medical Journal and The Lancet, questions the quality of clinical trials of the effectiveness of antidepressants.\n \nHe notes that in a number of studies, placebo was different from the active drug in terms of physical characteristics, such as texture, color and thickness; that placebo in the vast majority of studies on the action of antidepressants had no side effects (eg, dry mouth), with the exception of the rare cases when atropine was used as a placebo, and because of the absence of side effects, patients in the studies could suspect that they were not taking the medicine but placebo.\n \nAccording to G\u00f6tsche's conclusions, the true difference in improvement with antidepressants and placebo seems to be significantly less than the 10 percent reported in official research results, as there is evidence that a double-blind study in which blinding is inadequate can lead to a very significant exaggeration of the effectiveness of drugs [19].\n \nG\u00f6tzsche also mentions that bias in the prozac-sponsored trials of prozac (fluoxetine) is very high: in direct comparative trials, where this drug was the main subject of the study, a significantly larger number of patients became better off from it than in trials in which Prozac was a comparator that is, it was used for comparison) [19].\n \nIrving Kirsch (English), a well-known American psychologist, having analyzed a number of clinical studies of antidepressants (including those of them whose data were not printed, because they received undesirable results), found that the results of most studies are negative.\n \nThe median difference between the drugs and the placebo was only 1.8 on the Hamilton scale (widely used for assessing the symptoms of depression), although the difference was significant statistically, but clinically meaningless. However, since studies with positive results have been widely published, and studies with negative results have been hiding, the public and medical professionals have come to believe that these drugs are highly effective antidepressants [21].\n \nIn 2008, an analysis (Turner and co-authors) of both published and unpublished studies on the effects of 12 antidepressants was conducted; data from these studies were provided to the authors of the analysis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was found that 94% of previously published trials showed an antidepressant benefit compared with placebo; However, after reviewing the results of both published and unpublished trials, Turner and co-authors found that only about 51% of them show an advantage compared to placebo. Of the 74 studies reviewed, only 38 had positive results, and almost all of them were published. Studies with negative or questionable results were mostly unpublished (22 studies), or published with distortion of results, as a result of which they appeared as positive (11 studies) [22].\n \nStatistics specialist Hans Melander and his colleagues from the Swedish Medicines Agency in 2003 showed that published articles on trials of SSRI antidepressants contain significant distortions compared to data on studies provided in registration applications sent to the agency. In all 42 studies that were submitted to the agency, except for one, the company performed both an intentional analysis and an analysis according to the protocol (which does not include patients who dropped out of the study). \n \nHowever, in only two publications of the results of the studies, both analyzes were present, but in the remaining cases only a more favorable analysis was provided - analysis according to the protocol. This created a false impression on the readers about the effectiveness of the drugs. In addition, individual tests were sometimes published as if they were the same test, there were no cross-references to numerous publications of the same trial; sometimes there were no surnames of authors, common to all publications [19].\n \nA systematic review of 29 published and 11 unpublished clinical trials (authors of the review - C. Barbui, T. Furukawa, A. Cipriani, 2008) showed that one of the most popular and often prescribed antidepressants - paroxetine does not exceed placebo in terms of overall efficacy and tolerability of treatment. These results were not distorted by selective selection of published studies [23].\n \nIn connection with the increased risk of suicide against the background of taking paroxetine, several dozens of lawsuits were filed against the manufacturer of this drug GlaxoSmithKline.\n \nThe lawyers of the affected parties managed to gain access to the internal documentation of the company and to draw as a result of its study the conclusion that GlaxoSmithKline as early as 1989 had information about an eightfold increase in the risk of suicide when taking its drugs [24].\n \nIn general, the risk of suicide and suicidal tendencies in the use of SSRIs is much higher than reported by pharmaceutical companies. So, at least three companies: GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Company and Pfizer - added suicide and suicide attempts to the placebo group in clinical trials if they occurred before patients were randomized into groups. \n \nIn addition, cases of suicidal thoughts and actions in the results of clinical trials are often referred to as \"emotional lability\". Often, events related to suicidal intentions caused by the drug were not recorded if they occurred shortly after the withdrawal of SSRIs; Finally, data on many studies that showed undesirable results were completely hidden [19].\n \nAccording to M. May, the unpleasant tendencies that he notes in the study of bipolar disorders are biased in favor of new drugs compared with traditional ones (mainly lithium): in some studies, the level of lithium in the blood was too low, and therefore it is not surprising that these patients had worse treatment outcomes than those who received new psychotropic drugs; several clinical trial reports focused on the secondary properties of the drugs (eg, no side effects), resulting in studies that were evaluated as positive, although the primary effect of the drug was not different from placebo [1].\n \nM. May also mentions that The Lancet publicized one of the cases of a financial conflict of the opposite kind: it turned out that the author of the articl\u0443 which found a link between vaccination against measles and rubella and several cases of autism, had financial ties with a law firm that A lawsuit in favor of children allegedly affected by vaccination [1].\n \n**References**\n\n1.

was it nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After he left we tried to reach him, we saw him everytime he wanted i tried not to let his behaviour get to me, bit my lip so i didn&amp;#39;t give him any ammo to blame me with, tried to act happy and put on a brave face,  our child kept questioning him why did he leave, why was he mean, why doesn&amp;#39;t he care about our feelings, why can&amp;#39;t he just love us we didn&amp;#39;t do anything etc he wanted an apology he never got it, because his dad doesn&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s done anything wrong, they would just get in massive arguments and his father would walk off often saying things like I&amp;#39;m not going to see you next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway fast forward to now, its been almost 1 year since he left us and our son is just getting worse, he is 7 now and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do with him, he&amp;#39;s a lovely boy but he&amp;#39;s very insecure and clingy, he hates being away from me, we share the same bed he wont sleep away from me, he&amp;#39;s anxious in school because he thinks I&amp;#39;m not coming back, he has nightmares about me dying or someone killing him, (in the latest he said a pig with a knife wanted to kill him because he turned the pigs friend into bacon but the friend had asked him to).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;he is relentlessly negitive, he says no one loves him except me, he sort of refuses to accept his extended family (aunts, uncles etc of being anything to do with him and caring about him) he&amp;#39;s convinced all the games consoles in the house are going to break soon, asks things like whos going to die first me or him, when do i think the world will end etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s forgotten his father,  we haven&amp;#39;t had a visit to him since September, i cut him off for my own mental well-being, at the last meeting he was distant and uninterested, constantly on his phone, he wouldn&amp;#39;t play with our son, a massive argument happened, he walked away our son vanished into some bushes and i found him curled up crying took ages to calm him down\\cheer him up, but we walked into his father again and they started arguing again then his father walked off again saying he wouldn&amp;#39;t see him next week, then he sent me several victim blaming texts, our son apologized via text but he ignored it and carried on sending woe is me no one wants me texts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that was around the start of September, now our son says can&amp;#39;t really remember the visits and he can&amp;#39;t remember when daddy lived here. He asks me questions about his dad its like he really doesn&amp;#39;t remember anything that happened. He used to hate his dad, after he left he said he was happier without him here shouting and being mean, he hated talking to him on the phone, i had to encourage him to see him, to talk to him to not take what he says and does to heart because daddy can&amp;#39;t help the way he is now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  was trying to reach his dad get him to get help an I also had the social worker on me saying son and father must have a relationship i have no right to cut off access as he has parental rights etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now instead of i hate my dad, my son is saying i love my dad i miss him I want to see him, I don&amp;#39;t understand why he&amp;#39;s not here, daddy loves me, he only does mean things if I&amp;#39;m a bad boy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kid is getting manipulative, threatens to punch himself, wont take responsibility for things, he tripped over yesterday and blamed me, he had a meltdown because I told him to own what he does nothing is going to happen to him, he screamed and started kicking me just because I wouldn&amp;#39;t take his blame and wanted him to understand that he tripped over and thats it, its an accident it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, I ended up giving him a timeout for kicking, he was howling and punching his legs the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He makes a humming sound a lot the school call it self soothing, the school is really on my back about his behaviour,  they excluded him last week and told me to take him to a doctor to have him checked for autism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d given him a chart to check his mood, i thought it was for me that they&amp;#39;d give me it at the end of the week to see how his behaviour has been am and pm and on certain days to try and pinpoint any triggers.\n Turns out they where using it as a rewards chart, they know he sprials if he thinks he&amp;#39;s done bad, I don&amp;#39;t know what he did but he said they gave him a sad face on his chart and that made him angry and think of dad, said he refused to do as he was told and ran away into the school grounds, the school said 5 teachers where trying to keep him safe and they dont have the resources for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s getting therapy for his anger apprantly he likes to create things and then totally destroy what he&amp;#39;s made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think having him able to see his behaviour chart was a really bad idea because to him in his negitive brain its not showing achievements its showing failure and any achievement to him is a fluke down to luck he wont accept that he&amp;#39;s good at anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could he be autistic? Or could all that be caused by whats happened or both? His fathers as useless as a chocolate teapot, you cant talk about emotional things to him he just lashes out, i tried to explain in hopes he actually had some care but he just called it all crap, accused me of telling our son lies, accused me of demanding Money off him (i haven&amp;#39;t in fact I&amp;#39;ve told him repeatedly i dont expect anything from him) and moaned i was preventing him being a father which he has been accusing me of since before he left.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he want to do is see his son whenever he feels like it, maybe twice one week then not at all for a month and play football with him, go boating or watch a movie. But that never happens unless our son kisses his backside and treds on eggshells so he doesn&amp;#39;t trigger dad. The man has never attended a school play, never makes himself available during school holidays etc and our son isn&amp;#39;t stupid he cottoned on to the fact dads never there for him ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The school don&amp;#39;t seem to understand, the social worker plays it down saying the man can&amp;#39;t be that bad since hes holding down a job, has a girlfriend and lives alone. So they are blaming our son, the school says things like theres lots of kids who don&amp;#39;t live with dad in the school they don&amp;#39;t behave like he does. I need to discipline him, but i swear if I try to set the boundaries like the teachers do it drives him down more, he doesn&amp;#39;t learn to be good because he thinks he is inherently bad, no matter what he does he will get in touble etc&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might add he&amp;#39;s very picky about food too and getting worse he will just switch off to an entire food group, at the moment he mainly lives off bread, cereal and chicken, he&amp;#39;d rather starve then eat say sweetcorn that he used to love or lumps of cheese and everything has to be seperate on the plate.  Sometimes he wants things in the shops like buy sausages but then refuses to eat them and claims he didn&amp;#39;t say to buy them I&amp;#39;m lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I don't know if anyone reading remembers my previous posts, if not please read em but I will give a quick run down here,  my ex was emotionally abusive and walked out on us last year, it started after we had a child then slowly got worse until his own father died, when that happened he got apocalyptically angry at us and irrational shouting about killing himself, starting a new life with other women and going to Hollywood to make his fortune doing his dream job, he'd been redrawn for a long time, he'd say anything in front of our child no boundaries, he'd be full of blame and paranoia mainly aimed at me, in his mind he never made mistakes everything was someone else fault, he wasn't exactly helpful with anything, work and workmates came first with us a distant second.\n\nA quick example would be the Saturday he promised to stay home with us, he went out food shopping saying he'd be back at midday, he didn't come back until after 10pm claimed he'd gone cinema and then drinking with mates, our son refused to eat until daddy came home because daddy promised to have dinner with us  (he was 5 at the time) he eventually gave up at ate around 8pm, his fathers response was not his fault the kid wouldn't eat, that was it nothing else.\n\nAfter he left we tried to reach him, we saw him everytime he wanted i tried not to let his behaviour get to me, bit my lip so i didn't give him any ammo to blame me with, tried to act happy and put on a brave face,  our child kept questioning him why did he leave, why was he mean, why doesn't he care about our feelings, why can't he just love us we didn't do anything etc he wanted an apology he never got it, because his dad doesn't think he's done anything wrong, they would just get in massive arguments and his father would walk off often saying things like I'm not going to see you next week.\n\nAnyway fast forward to now, its been almost 1 year since he left us and our son is just getting worse, he is 7 now and I don't know what to do with him, he's a lovely boy but he's very insecure and clingy, he hates being away from me, we share the same bed he wont sleep away from me, he's anxious in school because he thinks I'm not coming back, he has nightmares about me dying or someone killing him, (in the latest he said a pig with a knife wanted to kill him because he turned the pigs friend into bacon but the friend had asked him to).\n\nhe is relentlessly negitive, he says no one loves him except me, he sort of refuses to accept his extended family (aunts, uncles etc of being anything to do with him and caring about him) he's convinced all the games consoles in the house are going to break soon, asks things like whos going to die first me or him, when do i think the world will end etc.\n\nHe's forgotten his father,  we haven't had a visit to him since September, i cut him off for my own mental well-being, at the last meeting he was distant and uninterested, constantly on his phone, he wouldn't play with our son, a massive argument happened, he walked away our son vanished into some bushes and i found him curled up crying took ages to calm him down\\cheer him up, but we walked into his father again and they started arguing again then his father walked off again saying he wouldn't see him next week, then he sent me several victim blaming texts, our son apologized via text but he ignored it and carried on sending woe is me no one wants me texts.\n\nSo that was around the start of September, now our son says can't really remember the visits and he can't remember when daddy lived here.

My girlfriend of 1.5 years just told me she cut herself today and I don&amp;#39;t know what I should do to help. She tends to just get sad sometimes, but I didn&amp;#39;t realize the extent of it until now. Last night was similar to what tends to happen when she gets sad, we were hanging out and we were both very happy and excited at the start. We went for a walk, we were both laughing a lot, but then for no necessarily visible reason she seemed to get sad and she lost interest in really doing anything.

I do my best to cheer her up and be there/supportive for her, sometimes I am successful but other times she just stays sad for a little but then perks up a day or so later.

One of my concerns is that she will try again. I feel like that is something where once she starts it will be easier to do it again in the future, with a mentality where it won&amp;#39;t be as hard a second time since she has already done it before.

Except when troubles get to me they get to me personally and deep now. I never used to be like this, back when I was in highschool me and my friends would joke about dark and cruel shit. But nowadays I feel as if even if one of my friends make a joke remotely about me it\u2019s a personal attack. Even this latest joke they came up with out of the blue \u201cmy names &lt;em&gt;insert my name here&lt;/em&gt;, yeaaaah\u201d feels as if they\u2019re trying to attack me on a personal level.

I just have random depressive episodes around them which they notice but typically gets blown off with a couple jokes and then I\u2019ll usually disassociate myself from everybody for awhile until I can actually manage myself again. I\u2019ve made the joke that I still haven\u2019t cried for at least a year and honestly I haven\u2019t.... I\u2019ve tried to cry so many times now but because I\u2019ve always bottled up my emotions to stop myself from crying I feel as if I literally cannot. Right now even I feel as if I\u2019m on the verge but it never comes. I want to experience that again so it hopefully brings a small amount of clarity to my life.

I have one friend who constantly makes fun of me for my crush on this girl (same whom I threatened to remove his teeth) so should I just somehow cut him out of my life? I\u2019m not going to sit down and talk to him about this. We\u2019re not that kind of people.

I have good coworkers but a frustrating boss. I\u2019ll work hard and I only get recognised for the shit that gets missed from my boss. While everyone else congratulates me on my hard work. I\u2019ve been told by the store manager my hard work hasn\u2019t been unnoticed and that I should be given full time &amp;amp; pay raise before the end of the year but I was told that a month ago and nothing.

And I\u2019ve been so close to just telling my boss to fuck himself and leave the store and I feel as if part of the cause is my worsening temper and lack of control of my emotions.

But I want to die.\n\nTypically I would vent this sort of shit out on one of my usual personal social media\u2019s but with all of my friends &amp; family connected on them I wouldn\u2019t want them to know what I go through on a daily, repetitive basis.\n\nI\u2019m basically as normal as normal gets, normal friends &amp; family and normal troubles. Except when troubles get to me they get to me personally and deep now. I never used to be like this, back when I was in highschool me and my friends would joke about dark and cruel shit. But nowadays I feel as if even if one of my friends make a joke remotely about me it\u2019s a personal attack. Even this latest joke they came up with out of the blue \u201cmy names *insert my name here*, yeaaaah\u201d feels as if they\u2019re trying to attack me on a personal level. I\u2019ve even threatened one of my friends to rearrange their fucked teeth if they made the joke again....\n\nI\u2019ve been struggling with my emotions for awhile now but suddenly it\u2019s starting to snowball and I feel completely out of touch with everything and everyone I\u2019m around. I\u2019m the kind of person to keep my emotions to myself. My friends know I\u2019m having it rough but they don\u2019t know the extent of it. I just have random depressive episodes around them which they notice but typically gets blown off with a couple jokes and then I\u2019ll usually disassociate myself from everybody for awhile until I can actually manage myself again. I\u2019ve made the joke that I still haven\u2019t cried for at least a year and honestly I haven\u2019t.... I\u2019ve tried to cry so many times now but because I\u2019ve always bottled up my emotions to stop myself from crying I feel as if I literally cannot. Right now even I feel as if I\u2019m on the verge but it never comes. I want to experience that again so it hopefully brings a small amount of clarity to my life.

I don\u2019t know when it started really, I think it\u2019s been there since I was young as it took extra long for me to get over a pets death or was unwilling to join other kids games and sleepovers I was invited too. Mental health problems are strong in my family, mainly my mums side. She noticed early on that that could be the problem but she kinda, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, she told me this after it got very bad and she took me to a doctor, vet she didn\u2019t want it to be happening to me do just kinda.. ignored it, hoped it was something else. It was only after I would come home from school and go straight to bed, had panic attacks over simple math homework, or would call her three times a week after freaking out in class that she sat me down and told me it could be something more serious. I knew about mental illness and could identify it in others but it just never occurred to me I could be suffering from it.. I always just told myself I didn\u2019t sleep well or are stress about a thing that is coming up. After the talk with my Mum it kinda clicked. Even so my mum still put off taking me to the doctor for a little while but I wanted help. It sucked feeling like that and I was sick of hiding behind a smile and my jokes.  Didn\u2019t look or ack depressed at school or in town but, it was kinda myself getting so irritated I other people. I went to a university forum debuting the break before my last year of high school so was able to talk and interact with likeminded people and experience living in a city and going to the university, but when I started school again in my small home town with all the petty bitchness that is immature teenagers  .. idk it was hard, getting dragged into stir I didn\u2019t care about or getting targeted by one of the \u2018popular\u2019 kids because I took a leadership role they were wanting.. idk it was just petty and stupid waist of time and effort, and it just tipped the skates of what I could handle. So I crashed. I would talk to my Mum about these things and she would say I\u2019m an adult stuck in a child\u2019s body. I love my mum so much and she is my rock. Anyway, sorry this is long haha spilling out my life story here ~&lt;/strong&gt;~. But I got put on the antidepressant Prozac and it generally works well for short time use. But I\u2019ve been on it for almost two years and the side effects really started to show.  I went on exchange this year so my doctor recommended I stay on the drug. I was starting to feel better but still had episodes , that\u2019s why he thought it was best. But only of the side effects I really noticed, and the one he warned me about, was the emotional numbness. The drug is designed to stop extremism negative emotions ~ anxiety ~ but I knotweed almost instantly it stoped all extremes. Excitement. I didn\u2019t feel much when I got on a plain to the other side of the world for my exchange. Sadness. I didn\u2019t feel anything when my cat died or when I walked though Auschwitz in Poland. Happiness. Yeah I laughed and felt  \u2018good\u2019 when I was with friends but it didn\u2019t stick. I haven\u2019t felt homesick at all this year, and it often slips my mind to keep in contact with people, I forget that they feel. God I missed feeling. I have tried a few times this year to take my self of the medication without success. I know it\u2019s not recommended to do that yourself incase of relapse, but I was desperate and could recognise if I was getting bad again. But more recently I tried again. And so far it\u2019s working. I\u2019ve been feeling really good lately with a lot of meet ups with friends and a good host family. Christmas is coming up so it\u2019s very festive. The weather is cold but it snows which is amazing (where I live at home it never snows). My emotions are coming back. I have gone off my mess for about three weeks and they are already starting to appear. Sadness was the first. Not bad sadness mind you, but during a sad part of a movie I felt it. I haven\u2019t felt that in so long it was strange. Happiness. Genuine happiness. I felt so happy after I found the perfect secret Santa gift that I actually did a little skip. I\u2019m starting to get excited when opening my event calendar and for upcoming events. It sounds strange but I hope I feel a little bit homesick for Christmas. Feel. God I love that word. Feel. I could be thinking about something a a rush of emotions would come over me in an intense wave and I had forgotten that they work like that. I had got so used to being numb. Not everything has returned yet. It\u2019s mainly the extremes. Eventually though I hope normal, small emotions start coming back. I go home in less then a month but I don\u2019t know what to tell my doctor as we were supposed to start taking me off the drugs after I got back or move me onto something more long term. I would prefer not to take anything but I worry that after coming home from the buzz of travel I will have a relapse. But I\u2019m going to university soon after I get back. I think if I just keep my mind busy and stay on top of my work load it will be okay. Hopefully all the drama queens stayed at high school of whatever whole the reside in.

I also feel much more in tune with my feelings when im at this state of extreme overtiredness, like I feel that im much more in tune with how I feel.\nI really dont know what to do, I know this is extremely unhealthy for me and at this point I dont even know if im just deluding myself.\nMy therapist have said that its seen in manic people but havent really said anything more about this specific problem.\nTL;DR I feel much better and more motivated than ever when I stay up all night and im always afraid of going to sleep because I know that the world is gonna look grey when I wake up.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7h8f1a", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I dont want to go to sleep.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7h8f1a", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7h8f1a/i_dont_want_to_go_to_sleep/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512314569.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7h8f1a/i_dont_want_to_go_to_sleep/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "mediawh0re", "created_utc": 1512285769.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 0}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, I have BPI with psychotic features.

He knows i have mental issues (schizophrenia) and still seems dead set on making me work alongside this constant negative presence by myself and when I call or message and I'm clearly in a bad way, offers nothing more than a \"awe that's too bad, do you need a ride to work?\"", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7h6blr", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Trying to figure out what to do.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7h6blr", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7h6blr/trying_to_figure_out_what_to_do/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512288308.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7h6blr/trying_to_figure_out_what_to_do/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Zimjamboa", "created_utc": 1512259508.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking the barrier&lt;br/&gt;\n         From the very beginning of your life, you have been used to listening to your thoughts like they were 100 percent truth. That is just human nature. Your thoughts are what you live in, without them we wouldn\u2019t function. Thoughts are the number one influence on decision making, that is how our brains are hardwired to function.\n         What if I told you that you were doing it wrong? That the majority of people in the world have it all wrong. You might think I am crazy, full of it, don\u2019t know where I am getting these crazy claims from. You might think about it and give it some thought but not think much of it, blow it off. Listening to your thoughts, that is the last thing you want to do if you want to be satisfied in life. Breaking that barrier and becoming a separate entity from your thoughts is an extremely tough process, as I am writing this I still have not mastered it. Before I dive too deep, let\u2019s take a step back and look at the big picture\n         Thoughts are the vein of or consciousness, they are how we function as a whole, why we are so technologically advanced and why everything we live in, your city or your house or even your pants, all exist from thoughts, without them we would be nothing, right? To understand our thoughts a little better let\u2019s break them down into three categories. The first, \u201cworded\u201d thoughts. These thoughts you use very often, for example, You are hungry, you decide to open the fridge and pull out ingredients for a tuna sandwich. You\u2019ll be thinking \u201cfridge\u2026.get the lettuce\u2026.mayonnaise...pickles...close fridge\u2026\u201d Simple, we do it all the time. The second is \u201cComplex worded\u201d this is when you are thinking deeper and put a little more effort into your thoughts, maybe if you are thinking vividly about something you are going to do. The next is \u201cpictured\u201d thoughts. These occur the least often. They are usually used when you think about a memory, you picture it in your mind. The final is \u201cincognito\u201d thoughts. These are the most common, simple thoughts that run through your head that are not in words or pictures, generally more of the source of anxiety for those with mental disorders. So there they are, worded, complex worded, pictured, and incognito.\n         Now to the problem. The issue, especially those suffering from any sort of anxiety or depression disorder is that you are swimming in your thoughts. Like I said before, you are so used to, as it is nature, to listen to our thoughts our brain throws at us and perceive them as facts, there we go. A very big issue affecting most of the world\u2019s population. You see, monks have it right. They have already mastered this and have found the secret to satisfaction in life. You are a fish and your thoughts are the ocean, you swim and exist in them. You cannot imagine living out of the water as a fish, right? This is where breaking the barrier comes in. You need to be able to view your thoughts as a separate entity from you.\n         This is something that took 11 months of a severe, severe anxiety disorder for me to realize, it is like driving a nail into a board, it takes a hammer, a force, the anxiety. Swings or hits, realizations and events, and time to really drill it into your head to the point that you understand just how crucial it is. You need to be able to separate your thoughts from you, one of the ways I do this is by calling my crazy irrational thoughts \u201cThe other guy\u201d  like Bruce Banner and the Hulk, Hulk or \u201cthe other guy\u201d will tear you down and only destroy. It takes time like I said, to realize your worries and thoughts, any thoughts are not part of you. Instead of swimming with your thoughts in the fishbowl, step out of that bowl (breaking the barrier) and view it from an outside perspective. You choose which thoughts you will let influence you, take the fish that you want out of the bowl, keep the bad fish in that bowl away from your influence. Realize that your thoughts are not the truth. Words cannot express how much I want to stress this. Your thoughts are not your reality, it took time for that to sink into me like I said with the hammer and nail example.\n         Step one is to Realize, these words you are reading right now can mean nothing to you if you let them, if you choose to perceive this as bs. Or you can act maturely and think about everything you are reading, yes you with anxiety. With depression. Going through a hard time, or really anyone reading this. Step two accept. This goes more for those with mental problems, accept your issues and that you were doing it wrong. Accept that I am right and you are wrong. Accept that you have been manipulated by your brain, and that leads to step three: Act. Take action, start practicing meditation, mindfulness, become a monk if that\u2019s what it takes. Like I said, for it to truly affect you, it needs a hammer and nail.\n         In conclusion, we are all doing it wrong. And it is destroying us, tearing us down, our number one enemy is our brain. And that is fact. But it can also be our best friend. The \u201cOther Guy\u201d is manipulating you, making himself look powerful and full of truth. Really he is weak and once you break that barrier you will see that. And take control of your life and feelings. I am just getting over a crippling anxiety which essentially stripped my life away from me. I am currently recovering from 11 months of hell. My journey is not over with anxiety, but it has truly changed who I am as a person. So please, take what I said in this and implement it into your life. Please. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To all those suffering from any mental disorder, there IS light at the end of the tunnel. Even if you cannot see it. Endure the pain well and use it as a learning experience, and you will be satisfied in life. It may be somewhat hard for some or it may be hard as hell for others to master this, but it will cure your mental issues, even if it takes a long time, it is hard. life is not easy.

I don&amp;#39;t do drugs, but I\u00a0smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My\u00a0Mental HELL began\u00a03 months ago.(22.07.2017 I DON&amp;#39;T GET IT HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN ONE DAY) I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone(Chester From Linkin Park) who died by\u00a0suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suddenly asked myself:\u00a0&amp;quot;Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?&amp;quot; and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don&amp;#39;t go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head:(As I said, I can&amp;#39;t trully describe them.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird feeling: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird feeling:  I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird random feeling: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feels like I won&amp;#39;t be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0When I try to do something I can&amp;#39;t do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can&amp;#39;t fully describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like I don&amp;#39;t want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can&amp;#39;t describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;weird feeling:\u00a0Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?).

He asked me if i have a plan or fantasie about.... Then I said no, but i see intrusive images. And he said that it is ocd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much symptoms of depression.\nBut I do have less/none interest in the things that used to be intrerested. I go less outside. I am more irritable. I can&amp;#39;t tell if I have anxiety because I want it or because I don&amp;#39;t. I am afraid of the summer comming, because I read somewhere that people often do it then and now it feels so damn real. It happened in one day I don&amp;#39;t get it. Also I went to 4 Psychiatrists and 1 Psychologist, I asked them if this is Major Depresive Disorder, they said that it is unlikely, because I have very few symptoms, They asked me if i set goals to high and so on. And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?! Maybe not?!?) What the actual f**k??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t wish to not being born, to not exist or to not wake up tomorrow for example. But there is a strange, unexplainable feeling that makes me think I am suicidal. WTF?\nAlso when I read somewhere that you should ignore or not give attention to the thoughts because it may become worse, I feel even more terrified because I can&amp;#39;t ignore the thoughts. Also the feeling that I don&amp;#39;t want to get better makes me more terrified. Does that sound like Active SI?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And many ??intrusive?? suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,\u00a0no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don&amp;#39;t think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime i post on reddit i feel like i missed something....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I sound suicidal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,\u00a0have a good night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello\u00a0reddit!\n\nFirst of all I am 19 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family. I don't do drugs, but I\u00a0smoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.\n\nMy\u00a0Mental HELL began\u00a03 months ago.(22.07.2017 I DON'T GET IT HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN ONE DAY) I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone(Chester From Linkin Park) who died by\u00a0suicide. Since then, my life changed completely.\n\nI don't know why.\n\nI don't know how.\n\nI don't know what to do next.\n\nI suddenly asked myself:\u00a0\"Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?\" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.\n\n\nI have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.\n\nMy interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head:(As I said, I can't trully describe them.)\n\nWeird feeling: Like when this happens EVERYTHING SEEMS DARKER AND DOOMED, LIKE IN A HORROR MOVIE?\n\nWeird feeling:  I simply cannot get out of my head when it happens, constant negative thoughts(i listed them above) weird feeling in the stomach, feeling dissociated from sveryone, everything i imagine in my head, even my home seems dark and doomed? \n\nweird random feeling: Like life is meaningless?!? Without a reason???\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feels like I won't be here soon.(generated From the scary thoughts.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Confusion if I am suicidal or not?!?!?!\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0This is about babies. Somewhere I have read \"I don't want kids on this terrible world.\" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Everything seems darker.\n\nWeird feeling: When I read here on reddit someone who is suicidal/depressed etc. All of the feelings come back and it feels like i am feeling the same way as him. (When time passes I can see the difference.)\n\n*AND THE MOST IMPORTANT* :**WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S.......

I warn you, this is going to be is rather long post, I suppose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a 18 year old guy, who goes to school and play some music in my free time. I like to do school work, and tend to like to do things neatly and perfectly. I don&amp;#39;t have a bad relationship with my family, who I live with. We aren&amp;#39;t poor, and live what one would categorzie as a good life. But still, I&amp;#39;m having such a hard time now, and have had for the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often become moody; I can with ease go from a happy mood to a bad one, just like flickering a light on and off. Or I can just be down for days on end, and then recover to a somewhat normal state where I&amp;#39;m stable. I have yet to experience euphoria, so I don&amp;#39;t think I am bipolar. I suppose you could call me cynical too; I&amp;#39;m not a good person, or at least I don&amp;#39;t see myself as one. I often feel worthless and terrible, and I genuinely see myself as a person who are worthless, terrible, the scum of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing that upsets me the most are currently my friendships. I have two friends I would say are very close, I think they see some of my struggling and want me to get better, but don&amp;#39;t know how. I care for them deeply, but I just feel sad around them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like they don&amp;#39;t care for me, like I&amp;#39;m nothing except a classmate. They rarely text me or initiate contact, and if I would like to talk to them I would need to be to one who initiated contact. It was fine at the start, but now I just feel like I&amp;#39;m a chore talking to, and I probably am. This goes for both of them, and it&amp;#39;s hard because I know they talk to each other, and initiate contact with each other. I have discussed this with them before, and they promise to initiate contact more, and they do, for a week or two, and then it&amp;#39;s silent again. I feel I also need to address that the two of them were friends before I met them, and now we all go in the same class.\nWe have a good time; when we&amp;#39;re at school or some other place, and since we have the same classes I can&amp;#39;t cut contact with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like talk about an instance, not too long ago, that really made the light shutdown and I felt instantly sad. We are out on party, and I was having fun. I was dancing, chatting with people, and I felt genuinely happy. I had so much fun. Some other friend of ours decided to hang out with us, and this was okay. I like that friend, even though I&amp;#39;m not as close to him, as I are to them. Suddenly, they all disappear on me. My friends left my and went with the other one, I was alone, and when I found them, they talked right through me, it was like I wasn&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was and still am heartbroken about this. I understand that they would like to hang out with that friend, he&amp;#39;s cool and all, but they aren&amp;#39;t as close as we are. I felt like I could literally tell them anything, like they were my closest friend, and I honestly thought they thought the same for me. I have spent two years getting to know them. We have talked about so much, and done so much together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to distance myself from them, but that also saddens me. They don&amp;#39;t see how hurt I am, and if I would try to tell them. They would be really supportive, say they&amp;#39;ll change, and nothing more would happen. We would be back to square one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I just feel like I&amp;#39;m entitled to more than I am in my relationships, or maybe I expect too much. I really don&amp;#39;t know anymore, and all my emotions are a mess.

The one that lays bare my soul, the true vulnerability I find hardest to talk about but today I break that. I may be using a throwaway account for the moment in order to hide who I really am but it\u2019s the first step, preparing me to really come forward. For the moment I will keep my identity quiet. This had the most impact on my mental health I believe, the one that caused the most damage and took it\u2019s toll on my mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I was 6 when the sexual abuse started. Most people may jump to the conclusion that it was my dad or uncle but no, instead it was my half-sister. I don\u2019t really know how it started or the first instance, I repressed a lot of that but from as far back as I can remember it began by taking me into her room, she would undress me and begin the process of trying to, I guess sexually arouse me even though I had no idea what that was. I don\u2019t think I need to go into detail about what happened but once she gained an erection from me she would force myself inside her. I would be an object for use. She would tell me it was ok, that half sisters and brothers do it all the time. I know she did this to reassure herself, I never really knew what was happening. Or what was going on. I was 6. She was the adult in my eyes being 5-6 years older. This went on till I was about 8 or 9. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She would always tell me to never tell mother and dad. Always saying that they would not love me anymore, using fear as a weapon to keep me quiet, threaten me that I would be sent away. And after some time it became the norm, I let it happen. Fear and shame did consume me and as I got older I think that is when I realised it was wrong but I did everything in my power to place this deep inside my mind into a location held far away. Unfortunately this was not deep enough. During the abuse in the early days I would go to a safe place, as such, let my mind wonder in another world. I don\u2019t know where this was but it helped. As it continued through the years I think I began to enjoy it in some way, not sexually but.. I don\u2019t know, something. I still felt great fear and shame but maybe feeling close to someone, being a part of something gave me enjoyment. I think that is why I felt so much guilt about it. I am still pondering this part. I always wonder maybe it is because I accepted my fate with this, it just became normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know when it stopped, I don\u2019t remember the last time she abused me but this is the morbid part. Or the part I don\u2019t understand. Everything went back to normal. I acted as though noting ever happened. She lived in the same house and I grew up into a teenager saying nothing. She moved out and then it was just me. Me and my broken self. The older I got the more aware I became of what happened to me, but thanks to that lovely perception of what a \u201cman\u201d is supposed to be I kept forcing it back into the darkness. Denying it, feeding it the hate, anger, shame and fear which made it grow. I always wondered why I was so explosive with my emotions, having to prove something, to be the man. I began to use drugs. I would steal my dads painkillers (until I was 19), smoke a lot of pot, use illegal class Bs and the newly loved legal highs in order to \u201cfeel\u201d happy. Add in steroids to feel that real \u201cmasculinity\u201d and you get the idea. Always using something to make me feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I struggled with relationships, I could never get close to someone or really let them know who I am. I would withdraw and times and when things got too deep, brink of admitting how broken I felt, I would mess around with someone else, giving them a reason to hate. I always needed them to hate. I was very hypersexual. Using it as a way to feel again. I do think that the abuse has played a hand in this but I have yet to connect the dots and rationalise why and how. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was early 2017 when all this began to come back in flashbacks. The fucked up part of the flashbacks were that I would they would come to me then drift away into the darkness and automatically I would think \u201cthat is going to kill me\u201d. It was like I already knew it was going to get worse and that I knew deep down I would kill myself in order to escape. Self-fulfilling prophecy you could say. Dreams would turn to nightmares and the shame came back with a vengeance, waking up overwhelmed with fear of people knowing who I truly am. I began to drink more, began to party again with old friends that included a lot of cocaine or MDMA, I just wanted it all to go away. This resulted in one night of heavily using cocaine, coming home to the beautiful woman I share a bed with and finally breaking down. For the first time in my life I showed someone who I really am and I was scared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish it had happened a more constructive way but either way I am glad.  Because for the first time in my life I feel genuinely happy. Not faked, I opened myself up fully to someone and they embraced me. I felt loved. From that point everything started to get better. This year has thought me so much about myself and allowed me to become the man I always wanted to be, which is me. I recovered that  idea of who I am. I am self aware and manage to deal with my emotions far better along with having the most wonderful and amazing woman help me along the way. Without her I don\u2019t think I would have been alive for much longer. I do owe my life to her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t talk to my half sister. I had began to drift away from communicating but now I have none at all and I am happy with that. I don\u2019t have to pretend that she took away my childhood, pretend everything\u2019s fine.

The one that lays bare my soul, the true vulnerability I find hardest to talk about but today I break that. I may be using a throwaway account for the moment in order to hide who I really am but it\u2019s the first step, preparing me to really come forward. For the moment I will keep my identity quiet. This had the most impact on my mental health I believe, the one that caused the most damage and took it\u2019s toll on my mind. \n\nI think I was 6 when the sexual abuse started. Most people may jump to the conclusion that it was my dad or uncle but no, instead it was my half-sister. I don\u2019t really know how it started or the first instance, I repressed a lot of that but from as far back as I can remember it began by taking me into her room, she would undress me and begin the process of trying to, I guess sexually arouse me even though I had no idea what that was. I don\u2019t think I need to go into detail about what happened but once she gained an erection from me she would force myself inside her. I would be an object for use. She would tell me it was ok, that half sisters and brothers do it all the time. I know she did this to reassure herself, I never really knew what was happening. Or what was going on. I was 6. She was the adult in my eyes being 5-6 years older. This went on till I was about 8 or 9. \n\nShe would always tell me to never tell mother and dad. Always saying that they would not love me anymore, using fear as a weapon to keep me quiet, threaten me that I would be sent away. And after some time it became the norm, I let it happen. Fear and shame did consume me and as I got older I think that is when I realised it was wrong but I did everything in my power to place this deep inside my mind into a location held far away. Unfortunately this was not deep enough. During the abuse in the early days I would go to a safe place, as such, let my mind wonder in another world. I don\u2019t know where this was but it helped. As it continued through the years I think I began to enjoy it in some way, not sexually but.. I don\u2019t know, something. I still felt great fear and shame but maybe feeling close to someone, being a part of something gave me enjoyment. I think that is why I felt so much guilt about it. I am still pondering this part. I always wonder maybe it is because I accepted my fate with this, it just became normal.\n\nI don\u2019t know when it stopped, I don\u2019t remember the last time she abused me but this is the morbid part. Or the part I don\u2019t understand. Everything went back to normal. I acted as though noting ever happened. She lived in the same house and I grew up into a teenager saying nothing. She moved out and then it was just me. Me and my broken self. The older I got the more aware I became of what happened to me, but thanks to that lovely perception of what a \u201cman\u201d is supposed to be I kept forcing it back into the darkness. Denying it, feeding it the hate, anger, shame and fear which made it grow. I always wondered why I was so explosive with my emotions, having to prove something, to be the man. I began to use drugs. I would steal my dads painkillers (until I was 19), smoke a lot of pot, use illegal class Bs and the newly loved legal highs in order to \u201cfeel\u201d happy. Add in steroids to feel that real \u201cmasculinity\u201d and you get the idea. Always using something to make me feel.\n\nI struggled with relationships, I could never get close to someone or really let them know who I am. I would withdraw and times and when things got too deep, brink of admitting how broken I felt, I would mess around with someone else, giving them a reason to hate. I always needed them to hate. I was very hypersexual. Using it as a way to feel again. I do think that the abuse has played a hand in this but I have yet to connect the dots and rationalise why and how. \n\nIt was early 2017 when all this began to come back in flashbacks. The fucked up part of the flashbacks were that I would they would come to me then drift away into the darkness and automatically I would think \u201cthat is going to kill me\u201d. It was like I already knew it was going to get worse and that I knew deep down I would kill myself in order to escape. Self-fulfilling prophecy you could say. Dreams would turn to nightmares and the shame came back with a vengeance, waking up overwhelmed with fear of people knowing who I truly am. I began to drink more, began to party again with old friends that included a lot of cocaine or MDMA, I just wanted it all to go away. This resulted in one night of heavily using cocaine, coming home to the beautiful woman I share a bed with and finally breaking down. For the first time in my life I showed someone who I really am and I was scared. \n\nI wish it had happened a more constructive way but either way I am glad.  Because for the first time in my life I feel genuinely happy. Not faked, I opened myself up fully to someone and they embraced me. I felt loved. From that point everything started to get better. This year has thought me so much about myself and allowed me to become the man I always wanted to be, which is me. I recovered that  idea of who I am. I am self aware and manage to deal with my emotions far better along with having the most wonderful and amazing woman help me along the way. Without her I don\u2019t think I would have been alive for much longer. I do owe my life to her. \n\nI don\u2019t talk to my half sister. I had began to drift away from communicating but now I have none at all and I am happy with that. I don\u2019t have to pretend that she took away my childhood, pretend everything\u2019s fine. She left me broken through many years, not allowing myself to be me. She asks my dad from time to time why not but he is happy with my response of not wanting to talk about it. \n\nCounselling has been the biggest help with not only finding the real me but also allowing me to come to terms with what has happened and how I can cope with this through he rest of my life. I will never forget what happened to me, but I can now manage it. What is wonderful is when I do talk about it I don\u2019t have that thought \u201cthis is going to kill me\u201d.

or seeing the shadow people in random empty corners both during the day and night) sense. i know i\u2019ve been experiencing things like this since i was in elementary school, i\u2019m 18 y/o girl and in college now, and i feel like i\u2019m progressively going insane. i can\u2019t seem to think straight and i\u2019m scared out of my wits every night and it can sometimes take hours and hours for me to fall asleep, and often when i\u2019m on my side with my eyes closed, i swear someone has crawled into my bed behind me and is being as close to me as can be without touching. in my head i see if from a third person\u2019s POV, and that person behind me is the devil. these paranoias shake me to the point of near-panic attacks and tears a lot of times.\n\ni just want to know if anyone has any

There are a lot of factors culturally and individually which contribute to this. Do you think tech is currently helping others to vent mental turmoil? Furthermore, looking towards future technologies do you see tech platforms helping this venting process? If so, do you think it is actually beneficial to vent online to non-physical allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One last caveat could you see tech platforms providing a space to talk about mental well-being.

I don't really care where the discussion happens, but I would love to hear some feedback around this.\n\nI think a big contributor to some stigma around mental health comes from a larger societal conditioning not to talk about what is going on in our mind. There are a lot of factors culturally and individually which contribute to this. Do you think tech is currently helping others to vent mental turmoil? Furthermore, looking towards future technologies do you see tech platforms helping this venting process? If so, do you think it is actually beneficial to vent online to non-physical allies.\n\nOne last caveat could you see tech platforms providing a space to talk about mental well-being. So rather than strictly aiding others in alleviating mental health issues, providing means to increase mental health to a more optimal level.

Me and my sister stayed there for 5 years and we were manipulated our whole time there I was 5 and my sister was 8 when we first got there. My mom is schizophrenic and took her insecurities out on me and my sister. Most of my abuse was because of school. My mom would always call me stupid and beat the shit out of me for being stupid and with my sister she would beat her up because she was chubby. I had a cousin there who tortured me constantly my breaking my stuff beating me up and sexually molesting me by touching me and making me do certain things the abuse persisted everyday. 5 years later my sister stole my moms phone and contacted my dad told him everything that happened and he brought us back to the us and got into a big fight with my mom. I was 10 and my sister was 13 When we came back it was very hard for me and my sister to cope with it because that pain felt like home so my sister started starving herself and but then formed bulimia after and I started self harming... my sister was sent to multiple treatment centers for eating disorders and I aswell for self harm\nWhen I was 15 I got into a big argument with my father and ran away with some bad people. I ended up wanting to numb the pain by buying xanax but ended up getting raped. I\u2019m still fighting to put him in jail.

Also not over a breakup that happened 7 months ago (or a year ago, depending on how &amp;quot;technical&amp;quot; you want to be if you knew our full story. but i&amp;#39;m not gonna get into that), and I honestly think that that&amp;#39;s what makes the family issue more potent. It&amp;#39;s those two things that are causing all of my issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been unemployed for a while, but I have a new job I am starting soon (it was supposed to have started already, but was rescheduled). But since I HAVE been unemployed, it has given me too much time to think, stress, worry, overanalyze. I&amp;#39;m a CHRONIC overanalyzer and my guy friend (who I&amp;#39;ll talk about in a second) even says I am a control freak. (Which freaks me out, but I appreciate his honesty. He doesn&amp;#39;t say it in a mean or degrading way, he&amp;#39;s just casually mentioned it a couple times)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my ex was a good person. A SUPER good person. Let&amp;#39;s call him T. Every day of my life I wonder if I made the right choice leaving T (T was my first relationship EVER). But sometimes, I wonder if T was mentally abusive. Or if I was. Or if we both were to each other. Since I KNOW for a FACT that my family DEFINITELY IS mentally abusive, I&amp;#39;m starting to worry that either: 1.) All I know from my family is mental abuse, so I will be a target and that is all I will accept, unknowingly (yet if I knew better, I&amp;#39;d make sure I was in a healthy relationship, but I&amp;#39;ll never know) OR 2.) It will be me. [I] will be the mentally abusive one, towards other people. And I don&amp;#39;t want that. But it&amp;#39;s all I know from my family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So T may or may not himself be mentally abusive. He could have had the best of intentions for me, and honestly I think he did. But I&amp;#39;m starting to get paranoid. I&amp;#39;m starting to notice a pattern with him. Ever since the break up, we would talk on and off. We both never wanted to leave each others side, and we still don&amp;#39;t. We would always contact each other no matter what, or no matter how much I&amp;#39;ve said &amp;quot;we need to stop talking, it&amp;#39;s only going to hurt both of us in the longrun&amp;quot;. We&amp;#39;re just addicted to each other. But the fishy pattern I notice in him are this: (AND BEFORE YOU GUYS JUDGE HIM OR TALK SHIT ABOUT HIM, YOU NEED TO READ THE NEXT INDENT THAT WILL BE COMING, OKAY, PLEASEEEEE!!!!!) 1.) He will SAY he loves me, SAY he fights for what he loves, but then only fight through words. Calls, texts, and words. No action. By now, I know you guys are already judging him, but PLEASE keep an open mind and read down to the next indent!!! 2.) It seems as if he doesn&amp;#39;t know me. DON&amp;#39;T JUDGE HIM YET. HE HAS SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS. It seems as if he doesn&amp;#39;t know anything about my personality. It&amp;#39;s so hurtful. We just can&amp;#39;t emotionally bond for shit. I want passion and depth- he can&amp;#39;t give me that. 3.) I remember him saying when we were together (on multiple occasions) that &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s done playing with people&amp;#39;s minds&amp;quot; - I looked over this because I DO believe in coincidence, and I DO believe in self-betterment. But honestly this is such a big red flag, because I&amp;#39;m not dumb, and I know that one of the &amp;quot;keys&amp;quot; to fucking with somebody&amp;#39;s mind is to convince them that you &amp;#39;quit&amp;#39; doing it.. he also tells me that [I] fuck with his mind a lot, and in a way I guess I do because I know that I should not be texting him knowing damn well we&amp;#39;re not over each other and it&amp;#39;s only gonna stop us from getting over each other... but it&amp;#39;s not like what I say to him isn&amp;#39;t genuine. It&amp;#39;s random. It&amp;#39;s mean a lot. But it&amp;#39;s genuine. And I always apologize if I feel I&amp;#39;ve gone too far. I apologize so much to him, and admit my wrongs, but he acts like I don&amp;#39;t (remember, he doesn&amp;#39;t know me...) Basically we&amp;#39;re in a circle or hurting each other, and he doesn&amp;#39;t even realize he&amp;#39;s hurting me. He&amp;#39;ll throw it in my face that he was loyal, and I KNOW he was- it&amp;#39;s not that that&amp;#39;s hurting me. It&amp;#39;s the lack of reciprocation of effort. It won&amp;#39;t get through his skull. He acts like he thinks that I think that he&amp;#39;s a cheater, which I know he is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, here&amp;#39;s the indent I was talking about: So, you guys may judge me or think I&amp;#39;m weird for this. Boo hoo, how rude can you be? I see something in him so don&amp;#39;t judge me for this: I think he may be a tad mentally slow. Like, he can function, but also just doesn&amp;#39;t seem completely there. He&amp;#39;s not mentally slow to the point that it would be morally wrong to date him- buuut he does seem pretty slow. I didn&amp;#39;t even want to admit it to myself until my best friend met him and mentioned it (not rudely btw). Because of this, I cut him HUGE slack. I think he GENUINELY does not understand a lot of things, and I can not fault him for it. I feel really bad for letting it get to me, too, because I feel like I needed to be a good girlfriend and BUILD HIM UP, and not let that little shit get in the way. I feel replaceable, because I could not help him through his struggle the way I GENUINELY WANTED TO, because at the end of the day I had to look after my own mental health, which has me questioning reality. If we weren&amp;#39;t long distance (AKA short distance, but when one or both of you are broke it feels like long distance) I would have given that relationship more in-person TLC, so the circumstances were out of my control. I tried to communicate with him SO HARD over the phone and text (and facetimes, when he answered) about how I want us both to be successful and happy, and wanted to take rational steps to having a future together. But he didn&amp;#39;t seem to stay on the subject, AND BEFORE YOU JUDGE HIM OR ME, AND SAY THAT &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;M DESPERATE AND HE MUST NOT WANT ME, REMEMBER WHAT I PREVIOUSLY SAID::::: I think it probably could have been because of either his short term memory loss, or his mental slowness, or both. He just couldn&amp;#39;t say focused if it had to do with something serious, and I think it&amp;#39;s genuinely because he genuinely didn&amp;#39;t know a lot of stuff, genuinely didn&amp;#39;t know what all the world had to offer (he DOES live in a hood, and is stuck in a loop of catering to his fake friends who use him. shit is sad, it really gets to me.) It hurts seeing him put them as priority over me, but he genuinely doesn&amp;#39;t see the way they really are, and when he does, he questions it, and ends up running back to those people, because he has too much faith in humanity. I swear to GOD, he is my male version, and I&amp;#39;m tearinh up writing this now, because I just want to see him do better, and be treated right, but I feel hypocritical because I&amp;#39;m also not treating him right, I AM, but I&amp;#39;m not- I try to help him think a litter straighter, but I could be doing it in a nicer way. I think the reason I don&amp;#39;t is because his brother told me that the best way to get through to his head is to hurt his feelings, so I guess I&amp;#39;ve grown addicted to doing that, and kind of take advantage of the fact that he lets me treat him any ol way, but I DO CARE about him. I&amp;#39;m just SO DESPERATE to see him do good, even if that means hurting his feelings into talking sense into him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways. With all the hellofaloo with my ex, ON TOP OF living with my mentally abusive family, I&amp;#39;m starting to worry I may living in a world SURROUNDED, just SURROUNDED in a melting pot of mentally abusive people. I&amp;#39;m starting to get very paranoid about this. I&amp;#39;m questioning SOOOO HARD right now who in my life TRULLLLY has my best interest at heart. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think about my best friend. Female friend. Of 5 years. Can I be honest? We&amp;#39;re both pretty shady TO EACH OTHER. I love her, and I know I do and I know I always will- but I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been lacking in our friendship, just because HER shady parts make me question if she&amp;#39;s really a real friend. I feel bad, because I WANT to be a good friend, and give our friendship the TLC it needs, but I am too emotionally exhausted to be fucked with it right now. I&amp;#39;m questioning is she&amp;#39;s really there for me, I&amp;#39;m questioning if ANYBODY&amp;#39;s really there for me. And because of that, I have become a quick-quitter friend. Or an &amp;quot;only on easy terms&amp;quot; friend. I NEVER used to be like this. The only reason I have lately become that is because I question people&amp;#39;s intentions for ME. If God came to me today to let me know she was 100% down, THEN I WOULD BE TOO. I would be a GREAT friend. But when I get into a state where I am questioning a person, I lack on my effort, as much as I hate to admit it and feel kinda bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to think of an example of some of the shady things she does/says that won&amp;#39;t tumble into a whole ENTIRELY off-topic story, and fuck up my character count (which it&amp;#39;s probably already too late for my character count. Lol, we will see.... I may have to put this on a doc.) Hmm...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay well next I guess I will mention my guy friend. He&amp;#39;s a friend with benefits. This is going to sound TERRIBLE, PLEASE do NOT judge him. You can MOST CERTAINLY judge ME, go ahead and judge me, because I was OBVIOUSLY in the wrong, but we met through me kind of/sort of cheating on my ex (which, by the way, was NOT the reason for our relationship ending. and the reason I say &amp;#39;kind of sort of&amp;#39; cheating, is because my ex agreed to an open relationship, but I also only know he only agreed to it to make me happy and shut me up. The reason I was asking for one was to fix out relationship problems, since I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling fulfilled in our relationship, but also didn&amp;#39;t want to lose him, AND LIKE I SAID, THIS WAS MY FIIIRST RELATIONSHIP, SO I DIDN&amp;#39;T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I DIDN&amp;#39;T BELIEVE IN GIVING UP ON PEOPLE, BUT THIS WAS LOOKING LIKE MY EMOTIONALLY-UNFULFILLEDNESS WAS ABOUT TO CAUSE MY VERY FIRST BREAKUP EVERR, AND I WAS PANICKING AND IN FREAK-OUT MODE, SO I WAS DESPERATE TO TRY ANYTHING TO SAVE OUR RELATIONSHIP. So I proposed an open one. Coincidentally, we did end up breaking up around that time anyways, despite that THAT was NOT the cause, just because I KNEW that I had to end it the moment I realized I could ACTUALLY even STOMACH being intimate with somebody else. It wouldn&amp;#39;t have been fair to him. My plan had failed, miserably, and looked like an asshole while I was just trying to tape shit together.) Anyways, back to my guy friend. It was his friend. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO JUDGE ME, I&amp;#39;m not going to try to convince you not to. It just kind of happened, I didn&amp;#39;t plan it. My ex&amp;#39;s friend came into my inbox after me and my ex officially posted that we were in an open relationship on facebook. I&amp;#39;m not dumb, I knew he was thinking I was just some kind of hoe and gonna try to use me, but the only reason I kept the (nonsexual) conversations going with the guy is because, not to sound conceited lol, but I knew that after he got to ACTUALLY know me that his opinion would change and he would ACTUALLY like me as a person. And that did happen. I was right. I knew I was right, or else I would have never entertained him in the first place. We meet alone for the first time, not on anything sexual at all, just talked and had some AMAZING deep conversation all night. Sunrise comes and he&amp;#39;s trying to make a move. I&amp;#39;m hesitant, but I end up letting it happen because he&amp;#39;s trying to eat me (and I had never been eaten before in my LIFE). I&amp;#39;m feeling bad, thinking about my ex and shit. Fidgeting hard as fuck, tears in my eyes, I wanted to stop halfway through but since I had already started I felt OBLIGATED to finish, I didn&amp;#39;t know what this guy was capable of, what if I would have told him that I wanted to quit and he assulted me or something? (Lucky now, I know he would never do that. But that moment was VERY scary for me. VEEERRY scary.) I asked him to tell my ex what happened, AND THAT IF HE DIDN&amp;#39;T, THAT I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD BE TELLING HIM. And I would have. I most definitely would have. When I fuck up, I confess, INSTANTLY. I&amp;#39;m actually very much NOTORIOUS for IMMEDIATE confessions. I have made immediate confessions to my ex before, for other stuff, so I most definitely have no problem doing so. I don&amp;#39;t hide shit, and when I fuck up, I DO feel bad. It eats at me alive, EVEN LOOOOONG AFTER the deed is done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, basically this dude becomes my second best friend. And my ex knows it. I&amp;#39;m not hiding it from him. He&amp;#39;s not even mad any more. His friend is my friend now. THEY WERE&amp;#39;NT SUPER-CLOSE FRIENDS ANYWAYS, BEFORE ANYBODY IS SITTING HERE THINKING THIS WAS HIS BFF OR SOMETHING. IT&amp;#39;S NOT. (still doesn&amp;#39;t make me any less of an aint shit bitch, though, which I&amp;#39;m not proud of) Let&amp;#39;s call the guy R. R is still my really good friend to this day, and we DID end up going even further on a later date. It&amp;#39;s crazy, because despite me knowing that R did NOT have good intentions for me from the jump, he actually turned out to be one of the realest friends I have. I know he has my back. I can talk openly and honestly to him about the inevitable doubts I have about him, and he does not get mad, he understands that I feel bad for having such poor judgement upon meeting him, and just has my back. I&amp;#39;m tearing up writing this now, because it&amp;#39;s crazy how the LAST person you&amp;#39;d expect to be real and be there for you ends up being the realest one on your team. He&amp;#39;s a swinger, I&amp;#39;m okay with that. I don&amp;#39;t want a relationship right now, or for a while even (8 years at least lol). We friendzone each other haha. He&amp;#39;s just that one person I can be bluntly honest with about ANYTHING, the good, the bad, the ugly, the horriffic... and he never friend-breaks-up with me or threatens to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SO what I&amp;#39;m thinking about doing is, cutting everybody off besides R for 2018. And I feel bad for wanting to do this, because MAYBE my ex actually WASN&amp;#39;T mentally abusive, and I was just reading into it too much. MAYBE my best friend (let&amp;#39;s call her K) WASN&amp;#39;T a fake friend, and actually had my back. So, I feel bad for wanting to do this, but I think I need to, to have the time to reflect without the blinders on. Right now I have love-blinders on for T and K because I care about them, and WANT them to be real. I think the only way to truly evaluate whether or not they are worth being in my life is to take a step back and live without them. But then, what if I never get them back? It&amp;#39;s all so scary and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;K recently called me emotionally abusive. And you know what, I think I am a bit. Not because I&amp;#39;m a terrible person who WANTS to be, but because I feel like the more and more I live in this dysfunctional house, the more it rubs off on me. I am becomming the people I live with, and it TERRIFIES ME to the max. There are days I&amp;#39;m SO irritable now, because I turn my saddness (my sadness over becomming them) into anger, and when I turn it into anger then I&amp;#39;m REALLY them, because they&amp;#39;re so bitter! See, it&amp;#39;s a vicious cycle, and as much as I NEED, and PRAY, and HOPE, and CRY that I break the cycle, I&amp;#39;m starting to realize that it is all I know- so how? How could I? I WANT to be a good person, a good listener, a person with empathy and compassion- all things I have SEVERELY been lacking on lately. If I had it my way, I&amp;#39;d be a philanthrope, a hippe. But instead I am slowly but surely becomming the opposite- a misanthrope, and a representation of my least favorite kinds of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to think, do, or begin. I am becomming narcisstic, I feel it. It is due to an EXTREME resentment I am holding over the family I reside with, and their narcisstic tendancies are rubbing off on me. Even if/when I get out of this hell house, I fear the effects will come with me to the new house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only 20, but since 19 I have been stuck in what feels like a quarter-life crisis. And I hope it&amp;#39;s just that. I hope it&amp;#39;s a phase. I hope I grow out of it, and become a successful, good-hearted person. But right now, I&amp;#39;m a purposeless, valueless waste and a BUM, who is starting to grow a cold heart that I really don&amp;#39;t have. Idk. Does this make sense? Does anybody have experience with something similar to this, and will it get better?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;;dr I don&amp;#39;t want to become emotionally abusive and narcisstic, but i think I am becomming just that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also drowning in depression from the effects of my mentally abusive family, and pretty damn bedridden (i&amp;#39;m lucky if i have energy to shower. and brush my teeth?? holy shit i need a grammy for that!!!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit:: holy crap it fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm 20 and currently living with psychologically abusive family, leaving me in this hyper-depression and I'm now mentally unstable asf. Also not over a breakup that happened 7 months ago (or a year ago, depending on how \"technical\" you want to be if you knew our full story. but i'm not gonna get into that), and I honestly think that that's what makes the family issue more potent. It's those two things that are causing all of my issues. \n\nI've also been unemployed for a while, but I have a new job I am starting soon (it was supposed to have started already, but was rescheduled). But since I HAVE been unemployed, it has given me too much time to think, stress, worry, overanalyze. I'm a CHRONIC overanalyzer and my guy friend (who I'll talk about in a second) even says I am a control freak. (Which freaks me out, but I appreciate his honesty. He doesn't say it in a mean or degrading way, he's just casually mentioned it a couple times)\n\n\nSo, my ex was a good person. A SUPER good person. Let's call him T. Every day of my life I wonder if I made the right choice leaving T (T was my first relationship EVER). But sometimes, I wonder if T was mentally abusive. Or if I was. Or if we both were to each other. Since I KNOW for a FACT that my family DEFINITELY IS mentally abusive, I'm starting to worry that either: 1.) All I know from my family is mental abuse, so I will be a target and that is all I will accept, unknowingly (yet if I knew better, I'd make sure I was in a healthy relationship, but I'll never know) OR 2.) It will be me. [I] will be the mentally abusive one, towards other people. And I don't want that. But it's all I know from my family. \n\nSo T may or may not himself be mentally abusive. He could have had the best of intentions for me, and honestly I think he did. But I'm starting to get paranoid. I'm starting to notice a pattern with him. Ever since the break up, we would talk on and off. We both never wanted to leave each others side, and we still don't. We would always contact each other no matter what, or no matter how much I've said \"we need to stop talking, it's only going to hurt both of us in the longrun\". We're just addicted to each other. But the fishy pattern I notice in him are this: (AND BEFORE YOU GUYS JUDGE HIM OR TALK SHIT ABOUT HIM, YOU NEED TO READ THE NEXT INDENT THAT WILL BE COMING, OKAY, PLEASEEEEE!!!!!) 1.) He will SAY he loves me, SAY he fights for what he loves, but then only fight through words. Calls, texts, and words. No action. By now, I know you guys are already judging him, but PLEASE keep an open mind and read down to the next indent!!! 2.) It seems as if he doesn't know me. DON'T JUDGE HIM YET. HE HAS SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS. It seems as if he doesn't know anything about my personality. It's so hurtful. We just can't emotionally bond for shit. I want passion and depth- he can't give me that. 3.) I remember him saying when we were together (on multiple occasions) that \"he's done playing with people's minds\" - I looked over this because I DO believe in coincidence, and I DO believe in self-betterment. But honestly this is such a big red flag, because I'm not dumb, and I know that one of the \"keys\" to fucking with somebody's mind is to convince them that you 'quit' doing it.. he also tells me that [I] fuck with his mind a lot, and in a way I guess I do because I know that I should not be texting him knowing damn well we're not over each other and it's only gonna stop us from getting over each other... but it's not like what I say to him isn't genuine. It's random. It's mean a lot. But it's genuine. And I always apologize if I feel I've gone too far. I apologize so much to him, and admit my wrongs, but he acts like I don't (remember, he doesn't know me...) Basically we're in a circle or hurting each other, and he doesn't even realize he's hurting me. He'll throw it in my face that he was loyal, and I KNOW he was- it's not that that's hurting me. It's the lack of reciprocation of effort. It won't get through his skull. He acts like he thinks that I think that he's a cheater, which I know he is not.\n\nOh, here's the indent I was talking about: So, you guys may judge me or think I'm weird for this. Boo hoo, how rude can you be? I see something in him so don't judge me for this: I think he may be a tad mentally slow. Like, he can function, but also just doesn't seem completely there. He's not mentally slow to the point that it would be morally wrong to date him- buuut he does seem pretty slow. I didn't even want to admit it to myself until my best friend met him and mentioned it (not rudely btw). Because of this, I cut him HUGE slack. I think he GENUINELY does not understand a lot of things, and I can not fault him for it. I feel really bad for letting it get to me, too, because I feel like I needed to be a good girlfriend and BUILD HIM UP, and not let that little shit get in the way. I feel replaceable, because I could not help him through his struggle the way I GENUINELY WANTED TO, because at the end of the day I had to look after my own mental health, which has me questioning reality. If we weren't long distance (AKA short distance, but when one or both of you are broke it feels like long distance) I would have given that relationship more in-person TLC, so the circumstances were out of my control. I tried to communicate with him SO HARD over the phone and text (and facetimes, when he answered) about how I want us both to be successful and happy, and wanted to take rational steps to having a future together. But he didn't seem to stay on the subject, AND BEFORE YOU JUDGE HIM OR ME, AND SAY THAT \"I'M DESPERATE AND HE MUST NOT WANT ME, REMEMBER WHAT I PREVIOUSLY SAID::::: I think it probably could have been because of either his short term memory loss, or his mental slowness, or both. He just couldn't say focused if it had to do with something serious, and I think it's genuinely because he genuinely didn't know a lot of stuff, genuinely didn't know what all the world had to offer (he DOES live in a hood, and is stuck in a loop of catering to his fake friends who use him. shit is sad, it really gets to me.) It hurts seeing him put them as priority over me, but he genuinely doesn't see the way they really are, and when he does, he questions it, and ends up running back to those people, because he has too much faith in humanity. I swear to GOD, he is my male version, and I'm tearinh up writing this now, because I just want to see him do better, and be treated right, but I feel hypocritical because I'm also not treating him right, I AM, but I'm not- I try to help him think a litter straighter, but I could be doing it in a nicer way. I think the reason I don't is because his brother told me that the best way to get through to his head is to hurt his feelings, so I guess I've grown addicted to doing that, and kind of take advantage of the fact that he lets me treat him any ol way, but I DO CARE about him. I'm just SO DESPERATE to see him do good, even if that means hurting his feelings into talking sense into him. \n\nAnyways. With all the hellofaloo with my ex, ON TOP OF living with my mentally abusive family, I'm starting to worry I may living in a world SURROUNDED, just SURROUNDED in a melting pot of mentally abusive people. I'm starting to get very paranoid about this. I'm questioning SOOOO HARD right now who in my life TRULLLLY has my best interest at heart. \n\nI think about my best friend. Female friend. Of 5 years. Can I be honest? We're both pretty shady TO EACH OTHER. I love her, and I know I do and I know I always will- but I feel like I've been lacking in our friendship, just because HER shady parts make me question if she's really a real friend. I feel bad, because I WANT to be a good friend, and give our friendship the TLC it needs, but I am too emotionally exhausted to be fucked with it right now. I'm questioning is she's really there for me, I'm questioning if ANYBODY's really there for me. And because of that, I have become a quick-quitter friend. Or an \"only on easy terms\" friend. I NEVER used to be like this. The only reason I have lately become that is because I question people's intentions for ME. If God came to me today to let me know she was 100% down, THEN I WOULD BE TOO. I would be a GREAT friend. But when I get into a state where I am questioning a person, I lack on my effort, as much as I hate to admit it and feel kinda bad. \n\nI'm trying to think of an example of some of the shady things she does/says that won't tumble into a whole ENTIRELY off-topic story, and fuck up my character count (which it's probably already too late for my character count. Lol, we will see.... I may have to put this on a doc.) Hmm...\n\nOkay well next I guess I will mention my guy friend. He's a friend with benefits. This is going to sound TERRIBLE, PLEASE do NOT judge him. You can MOST CERTAINLY judge ME, go ahead and judge me, because I was OBVIOUSLY in the wrong, but we met through me kind of/sort of cheating on my ex (which, by the way, was NOT the reason for our relationship ending. and the reason I say 'kind of sort of' cheating, is because my ex agreed to an open relationship, but I also only know he only agreed to it to make me happy and shut me up. The reason I was asking for one was to fix out relationship problems, since I wasn't feeling fulfilled in our relationship, but also didn't want to lose him, AND LIKE I SAID, THIS WAS MY FIIIRST RELATIONSHIP, SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN GIVING UP ON PEOPLE, BUT THIS WAS LOOKING LIKE MY EMOTIONALLY-UNFULFILLEDNESS WAS ABOUT TO CAUSE MY VERY FIRST BREAKUP EVERR, AND I WAS PANICKING AND IN FREAK-OUT MODE, SO I WAS DESPERATE TO TRY ANYTHING TO SAVE OUR RELATIONSHIP. So I proposed an open one. Coincidentally, we did end up breaking up around that time anyways, despite that THAT was NOT the cause, just because I KNEW that I had to end it the moment I realized I could ACTUALLY even STOMACH being intimate with somebody else. It wouldn't have been fair to him. My plan had failed, miserably, and looked like an asshole while I was just trying to tape shit together.) Anyways, back to my guy friend. It was his friend. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO JUDGE ME, I'm not going to try to convince you not to. It just kind of happened, I didn't plan it. My ex's friend came into my inbox after me and my ex officially posted that we were in an open relationship on facebook. I'm not dumb, I knew he was thinking I was just some kind of hoe and gonna try to use me, but the only reason I kept the (nonsexual) conversations going with the guy is because, not to sound conceited lol, but I knew that after he got to ACTUALLY know me that his opinion would change and he would ACTUALLY like me as a person. And that did happen. I was right. I knew I was right, or else I would have never entertained him in the first place. We meet alone for the first time, not on anything sexual at all, just talked and had some AMAZING deep conversation all night. Sunrise comes and he's trying to make a move. I'm hesitant, but I end up letting it happen because he's trying to eat me (and I had never been eaten before in my LIFE). I'm feeling bad, thinking about my ex and shit. Fidgeting hard as fuck, tears in my eyes, I wanted to stop halfway through but since I had already started I felt OBLIGATED to finish, I didn't know what this guy was capable of, what if I would have told him that I wanted to quit and he assulted me or something? (Lucky now, I know he would never do that. But that moment was VERY scary for me. VEEERRY scary.) I asked him to tell my ex what happened, AND THAT IF HE DIDN'T, THAT I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD BE TELLING HIM. And I would have. I most definitely would have. When I fuck up, I confess, INSTANTLY. I'm actually very much NOTORIOUS for IMMEDIATE confessions. I have made immediate confessions to my ex before, for other stuff, so I most definitely have no problem doing so. I don't hide shit, and when I fuck up, I DO feel bad. It eats at me alive, EVEN LOOOOONG AFTER the deed is done. \n\nSo, basically this dude becomes my second best friend. And my ex knows it. I'm not hiding it from him. He's not even mad any more. His friend is my friend now. THEY WERE'NT SUPER-CLOSE FRIENDS ANYWAYS, BEFORE ANYBODY IS SITTING HERE THINKING THIS WAS HIS BFF OR SOMETHING. IT'S NOT. (still doesn't make me any less of an aint shit bitch, though, which I'm not proud of) Let's call the guy R. R is still my really good friend to this day, and we DID end up going even further on a later date. It's crazy, because despite me knowing that R did NOT have good intentions for me from the jump, he actually turned out to be one of the realest friends I have. I know he has my back. I can talk openly and honestly to him about the inevitable doubts I have about him, and he does not get mad, he understands that I feel bad for having such poor judgement upon meeting him, and just has my back. I'm tearing up writing this now, because it's crazy how the LAST person you'd expect to be real and be there for you ends up being the realest one on your team. He's a swinger, I'm okay with that. I don't want a relationship right now, or for a while even (8 years at least lol). We friendzone each other haha. He's just that one person I can be bluntly honest with about ANYTHING, the good, the bad, the ugly, the horriffic... and he never friend-breaks-up with me or threatens to. \n\nSO what I'm thinking about doing is, cutting everybody off besides R for 2018. And I feel bad for wanting to do this, because MAYBE my ex actually WASN'T mentally abusive, and I was just reading into it too much. MAYBE my best friend (let's call her K) WASN'T a fake friend, and actually had my back.

I WANT to be a good person, a good listener, a person with empathy and compassion- all things I have SEVERELY been lacking on lately. If I had it my way, I'd be a philanthrope, a hippe. But instead I am slowly but surely becomming the opposite- a misanthrope, and a representation of my least favorite kinds of people.\n\nI don't know what to think, do, or begin. I am becomming narcisstic, I feel it. It is due to an EXTREME resentment I am holding over the family I reside with, and their narcisstic tendancies are rubbing off on me. Even if/when I get out of this hell house, I fear the effects will come with me to the new house. \n\nI'm only 20, but since 19 I have been stuck in what feels like a quarter-life crisis. And I hope it's just that. I hope it's a phase. I hope I grow out of it, and become a successful, good-hearted person. But right now, I'm a purposeless, valueless waste and a BUM, who is starting to grow a cold heart that I really don't have. Idk. Does this make sense?

I know it is a lot to ask but if you can I really appreciate it. \n\n**All I am asking of you is to like my page and if you feel like you can, be a patron.**\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Daily-Depressed-1581276658607538)\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/DailyDepressed)\n\nThank you all for your time!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7guw6n", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "First step into recovery", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/CwA6tjv_6vRfN8Hk021lQtkEcvEBMZov_qI6A_8eAyE.jpg?s=cc2066a5e3254adee5e03dc78c1b3e0e", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/CwA6tjv_6vRfN8Hk021lQtkEcvEBMZov_qI6A_8eAyE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=aaae39e24b2b7c2550edad7836d7d35d", "width": 108, "height": 108}], "variants": {}, "id": "ZGNLjHLITBCpUFPWWuL_KZumAMZR1vHR2dc7jgEobpc"}], "enabled": false}, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512136286.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7guw6n", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7guw6n/first_step_into_recovery/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512163017.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7guw6n/first_step_into_recovery/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "John_Daily", "created_utc": 1512134217.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started with an eating disorder when I was 18.

I tried to kill myself a few times, but I don&amp;#39;t think anyone in my family knows that. They were very serious but weak attempts as I was really young (12 - 15) and I didn&amp;#39;t have many resources. Currently I&amp;#39;m trying to get re-diagnosed and get medications as I&amp;#39;ve been experiencing hallucinations, memory loss/dissociation (not sure if it&amp;#39;s actually dissociation as people seem to use that term so loosely, but I&amp;#39;ve had multiple experiences where I sort of &amp;#39;snap out&amp;#39; of something and realize I don&amp;#39;t know what has happened or how I got to where I was -- sometimes this can be a bit dangerous as once I was with someone and I apparently started walking dangerously close to an oncoming train and was very angry with them but I didn&amp;#39;t remember any of this), very harsh mood swings where I overreact (eg. getting slightly frustrated and deciding it&amp;#39;s time to fly to another country and cut everyone out of my life), and some other issues. These mood swings have especially been affecting me because I know that I&amp;#39;m overreacting and it&amp;#39;s not logical, but I can&amp;#39;t stop or control myself and I still come dangerously close to doing things I would regret. A few days ago I had a slight fight with someone and the next day at work I spent the entire day trying to get hit by a car, and then I went home and stuck my head under water for as long as I could. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m really suicidal or not because I constantly think about killing myself or hurting myself but I feel like it&amp;#39;s too much work, that people around me will feel too much pain, and that my current responsibilities (eg. school work) get in the way. Unfortunately these responsibilities also prevent me from seeking emergency medical care, which I have considered but I truly cannot risk taking time off of work and university at the moment as this is a crucial time of year in terms of exams and projects, and I need the money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went to the doctor today to get some vaccinations.

Constant mental breakdowns and episodes.  Self harm, anger.  9 months later, went back to school online and moved in in PA with the GFs parents.  I&amp;#39;ve moved 11 times in 26 years.  Went on Seroquel, slept well for the first time in 15 years.  Hell on earth.  Worked two jobs, 80+ hours a week with travel to get experience for my degree.  Almost attempted suicide as the relationship flagged.  Got a permanent position while still attending school, moved out, thought things would get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t.  Relationship fell apart, bouts of anger and self harm, paranoia about cheating and abandonment (she was, emotionally, for months as she prepared to leave me it turns out).  Plans for suicide I told her about as she was leaving, and meant.  &amp;quot;Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment&amp;quot; along with my general attachment issues and lack of self esteem/worth.  My extra med dose saved me I think.  4 years ended in October, just as I was having my med adjusted and starting going to the therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now I&amp;#39;m at the therapist again.  &amp;quot;Borderline tendencies&amp;quot; but no diagnosis.  Abandonment issues.  Still OCD thoughts.  No identity left after the relationship.  Anger is gone, but self-hatred remains.  Suicidal ideation and instability.  Trying to figure out what is wrong.  Realizing my family was abusive and I have extensive emotional trauma.  I have no idea what&amp;#39;s me, what&amp;#39;s the disease, and what&amp;#39;s a symptom or cluster of symptoms.

Then I got in a very intense relationship, had a few mental breakdowns, dealt with roomates who got into drugs, changed my major.  Graduated Magna Cum Laude.\n\n\nWent home for 3 hellish months before moving to VT from MD for work.  Turned out poorly and developed a drinking problem and gained almost 100lbs.  Constant mental breakdowns and episodes.  Self harm, anger.  9 months later, went back to school online and moved in in PA with the GFs parents.  I've moved 11 times in 26 years.  Went on Seroquel, slept well for the first time in 15 years.  Hell on earth.  Worked two jobs, 80+ hours a week with travel to get experience for my degree.  Almost attempted suicide as the relationship flagged.  Got a permanent position while still attending school, moved out, thought things would get better.\n\n\nThey didn't.  Relationship fell apart, bouts of anger and self harm, paranoia about cheating and abandonment (she was, emotionally, for months as she prepared to leave me it turns out).  Plans for suicide I told her about as she was leaving, and meant.  \"Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment\" along with my general attachment issues and lack of self esteem/worth.  My extra med dose saved me I think.  4 years ended in October, just as I was having my med adjusted and starting going to the therapist.\n\n\nAnd now I'm at the therapist again.  \"Borderline tendencies\" but no diagnosis.  Abandonment issues.  Still OCD thoughts.  No identity left after the relationship.  Anger is gone, but self-hatred remains.  Suicidal ideation and instability.  Trying to figure out what is wrong.  Realizing my family was abusive and I have extensive emotional trauma.  I have no idea what's me, what's the disease, and what's a symptom or cluster of symptoms.  Hopeless.\n\n\nTL;DR - OCD, Depression, Bipolar, Anxiety, complex PTSD, Borderline?  Who the fuck knows.

I thought that parents drinking every night and having the cops come were normal. I thought my mom telling my dad she was going to cheat on him, that she hated him, but then begged him to stay , was how fights were supposed to be in relationships. She would say horrible things to my father, and my brother and I as well. I remember resenting her whenever she drank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I got older, her drinking got worse.

It was very traumatic seeing her do this, and over even the littlest thing she would flip out so much. I would tell her &amp;quot;Mom, it&amp;#39;s not that big of a deal!&amp;quot; Then she would turn on me. My mom has called me fat after I recovered from my anorexia. She said no man will ever love me. She told me that her and my brother would move away from me and my dad because she doesn&amp;#39;t want me. She also chose alcohol over me. I had hid it one night, but she was already drunk. She threatened to call the cops on me, saying I was a minor who had alcohol (I wasn&amp;#39;t drinking it). I said &amp;quot;You wouldn&amp;#39;t choose that over me.&amp;quot; She said she would. It broke my heart. I gave up. It got to the point where both my parents were horrible on drinking . My mom would say horrible things  and my dad would hit her. I hated both of them and harbored resentment. It made my brother spiral into a depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I didn&amp;#39;t  know she had BPD. I didn&amp;#39;t find out until just recently, and it all makes sense now. I also feel horrible because of what goes through her mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to my point. I have heard it is genetic as well as enviornmental. In my first relationship, I was very controlling and used harmful words. If I was sad, I would cut (I would say this had happened maybe 20 times in total in my entire life, I didn&amp;#39;t do it as often as my mom, and haven&amp;#39;t for months now) to stop the pain if it was too much. I heard this is a symptom. I also developed an eating disorder after my break up with my first boyfriend. I fell into a spiral of depression and I lost all passion for everything. I dropped to 80 pounds before I went to treatment . I had therapy for that. They never diagnosed me with BPD , but I never asked about it and they were treating me for an eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now recovered at 130 pounds . I&amp;#39;m pretty antisocial, except for a few people, my boyfriend, my parents, my brother (my absolute best friend) and my close friends (about 4 of them). Otherwise I don&amp;#39;t have a desire to talk to people. I have no passion for drawing, writing, singing or dancing anymore. I&amp;#39;m terrified my boyfriend is going to cheat on me or leave. If we fight, I feel so sad and worried he is going to leave. I do feel the desire to cut at times , but now do not . I try to work through my feelings.

No one even mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess there was nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m back to being suicidal. I haven&amp;#39;t been seriously suicidal since 2013, and had a major breakthrough in 2015 that made me really honestly appreciate life for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all that progress is gone now. I made a terrible mistake of convincing my husband that we should move in with his father last July to help him grieve and transition to a life without his wife, my husband&amp;#39;s mother. He was against it, but I couldn&amp;#39;t see it. His father seemed so nice to me and we seemed to get along so well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But everything changed the moment we moved in. Suddenly his father had these expectations from me that I physically was incapable of meeting. He knows I have a debilitating chronic illness, but he seemed to think that since he was older than me that I should be able to magically put aside the illness that has destroyed my career and life and become his replacement wife. The animosity against me has continued to fester while I continue to suffer struggling to battle my own demons caused by living with someone who is always mad at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to die. I&amp;#39;m the one who has written up anti-suicide blog posts, but the messages aren&amp;#39;t working right now. I&amp;#39;m too sick. I&amp;#39;m in too much physical pain. It&amp;#39;s so hard to sleep through the pain. It&amp;#39;s so hard to think through the brain fog. It&amp;#39;s so hard to get up and feed myself. It&amp;#39;s so hard to shower and so hard to jump through hoops to prevent a shower from dehydrating me and making my pain worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s so hard to get through moment to moment knowing the person outside my door hates everything about me. It&amp;#39;s so hard to ask for help knowing the person I love the most is stressed out to the max trying to help me and live up to the black hole of expectations from his father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to die. Came up with a plan of how to painlessly do it, and then seriously asked myself why I shouldn&amp;#39;t. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; keeping me from walking out the door and hiding in some woods to enact my suicide? The last time I was too depressed to move. I can move now, so why don&amp;#39;t I?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing is the thought that maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t. Maybe things will change. I should just wait and see. See how things unfold. Because what if something happens to fix things and I can get back to my peaceful life alone with my husband again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I know, absolutely know, I can&amp;#39;t survive the rest of the month with the way things are. I couldn&amp;#39;t even survive this morning without my opioids, muscle relaxers, and antianxiety medication to rescue me from the torture I was experiencing. But I can&amp;#39;t use them everyday. Even if tolerance wasn&amp;#39;t an issue, no doctor would prescribe it to me. They already hem and haw over the 30 pills I ask for a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t live in this house where my existence is a constant imposition. I have to sneak around to avoid making noise because my FIL wants no noise in the house. I have to stave off my bordem by locking myself in my room and watch the TV on low volume. I can&amp;#39;t read much due to my chronic daily migraines, so I can&amp;#39;t sit on the couch without bordem, and instead lay in bed which aggravates my pain conditions. I can&amp;#39;t have the temperature that doesn&amp;#39;t make me dizzy, nauseous and faint because I apparently don&amp;#39;t produce sweat, because my FIL is bitching up a storm at how upset he is that he can&amp;#39;t have the temperature in the house the way he wants it. Whenever I do anything that can remotely cool off my room, he complains that I&amp;#39;m fooling the thermostat and fucking up the temperature for the rest of the house. He wants every single room the same temperature, even mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I just can&amp;#39;t live with my FIL anymore. I have to move out. Now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband is shipping me off to another state to have my cousin take care of me. Because I&amp;#39;m so sick I can&amp;#39;t even take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why won&amp;#39;t I just die? I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ll just wait and see. Things were so nice and happy and peaceful when I was living alone with my husband. I was doing chores, some volunteer work, and even looked into starting a business. But then we realized I was doing so well that we thought, hey! Why don&amp;#39;t we have a baby!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then his mother died and the shit hit the fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I hold out for some hope that we can get back to that life again. We had it. We can have it again. As long as his father will let him go. I have my doubts he will let my husband go without a fight. But I do have confidence that at some point my husband will put his foot down and fight to get away and win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had dearly hoped my husband would move out with me, but I can understand how he thinks that spending one last Christmas with his father will be helpful. I know it won&amp;#39;t help his father because Christmas is not his problem: not having a personal slave is his problem. But I understand my husband&amp;#39;s need to at least try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hopefully I&amp;#39;ll survive through Christmas with my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tried and in so much pain and my brain is so cramped I have no idea how I&amp;#39;m going to pack.

Having recently come out of a relationship that ended in the total blindsided abandonment that has been cutely deemed \u201cghosting\u201d by my generation, the last thing I wanted to do was feel vulnerable in front of another man ever again. But then my friends forced me to get Bumble, get tipsy enough to swipe though roughly fifteen guys our beer goggles deemed hot enough, and I reluctantly set up one date I had every intention of cancelling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except I forgot, until two hours beforehand. And while I do have a somewhat notorious reputation in my friend group for being a bit of a heartless bitch (it comes with the territory when you\u2019re a cute 26 year-old female lawyer in the old boys club, who was largely raised by a progressive and brilliant single dad), I knew cancelling THAT late was rude as hell. So I made the most minimal effort possible, and walked into a date I mentally deemed a failure even before I got out of my car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy was fine, and for purposes of this post we can call him Jared. He was sweet, and cute, and talked about his career and hobbies in a way that made me want to find anything in life I loved that much.  However, coming out of a relationship of intense passion and constant drunken escapades of a grand scale, everything felt a little flat and I left feeling fairly indifferent about a possible date number two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I did feel was a new confidence to date all of Los Angeles. Over the next few months I continued to go on a stream of first dates with every form of bad boy in the metro area, all of which resulted in vague promises to see each other again that never amounted to anything. The one thing that remained was Jared. He was never there an obtrusive amount, but he also failed to ever let more than a few days pass without interjecting himself into my life in some little way. He remembered everything I told him about myself, and he always had a way of making me feel like the most important person in the room every time he looked at me. But I dismissed his intentions to a degree. At the time I justified my reluctance to open up to Jared as a knee-jerk reaction to his constant eagerness to understand me, but in retrospective I was probably just terrified. I guess I don\u2019t believe in the notion of falling in love, I see it as a constant choice to accept my partner for everything he is. But where Jared was so steadfast in knowing he wanted me and only me, I felt a distinct fear in the same knowledge; and for as much as he should have many times over, Jared never gave up on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then everything changed. I can\u2019t put into words how and why, because honestly the thought of typing out our story is still too much for me to even consider. I can say that I remember the exact minute I knew I loved him, and that I know with absolute certainty I will never forget that moment. Our relationship wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was built on selflessness and a kind of careful understanding that I\u2019ve never experienced in my entire life. It was painfully real, in a way that still causes me an immense amount of fear knowing I might never see that kind of love again. I allowed Jared to see vulnerabilities I didn\u2019t even know existed, and I never felt more secure in anything than knowing that he would be a constant fixture in my future. I believed him every time he wrapped his arms around me and told me he\u2019d never leave, and I felt so much security in knowing someone appreciated the full value of my flaws and still wasn\u2019t scared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then everything changed again, far sooner than was fair to either of us. I can still mentally replay everything about the day Jared left me. A week earlier he cried to me over the phone, explaining that he had a chronic anxiety disorder that cohabited with depressive episodes- one of which had just presented itself in full-force. He pleaded with me to forgive him for not telling me sooner, which just seemed to me to be misplaced concern when all I could spend my energy on was helping provide him the support I knew he would have shown me had the roles been reversed. But despite my best efforts to reassure him that my feelings were unconditional and my fear about our future together non-existent, I wasn\u2019t enough. The man who worshiped me from the day we met ended the relationship we had built on mutual respect over a text message. A text message sent a mere six hours after I went alone to a medical procedure where he had promised to come to provide emotional and physical support. A text message sent three days before we were scheduled to go on our first vacation together. A text message sent nine days before I turned 27. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jared explained that he and his therapist agreed that time alone to sort through his own emotional blocks, ones I didn\u2019t even know existed, was necessary. But the last time I checked, he was in a relationship with me- not a doctor who had entered his life a week prior. When I tried to talk to him about the break, all he could tell me was he didn\u2019t know what he wanted. Nothing about our conversation made sense, he went back and forth between telling me he had been considering leaving me for some time and also saying the decision came about so abruptly that he didn\u2019t have time to warn me. I used every tactic I could think of to convince him that his constrain suggestions that I deserved better than him were wrong, and that no decision of this magnitude should be made during a time of such great pain. But most of what I said went ignored, and the rest was met with little acknowledgement and no detectable traces of empathy. He completely denied me any opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue about our relationship, and left me feeling a form of abandonment I didn\u2019t even know existed- one that demonstrated to me that from his current perspective no aspect of our relationship was even worth trying to save. But the worst part was, I didn\u2019t even have a target to direct all my feelings of abandonment, resentment, and anger towards. Because this isn\u2019t him. I\u2019m not dealing with my equal partner, but I\u2019m still dealing with very real and painful consequences of the actions his brain has convinced him are logical and protective. What scares me even more is knowing that I will always, on some level, hope the man I loved comes back to himself and eventually back to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m an exceedingly bright person and I fully acknowledge so many standby responses to this situation. I understand that he doesn\u2019t want to be so desperate and confused about his mindset. I get that I should consider myself lucky that a shared house, marriage, or family wasn\u2019t impacted. I know that even if he survives this tragic episode of his life, revisiting a relationship might be too much for him or that even despite hard work by both of us it just won\u2019t look the same moving forward. I acknowledge that this will be a part of his person forever, but also wholly discern that dealing with this reality is much less fearful than a life without him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve reached out to him a couple times over the course of the past few months that we\u2019ve been apart, always clearly stating that a response isn\u2019t necessary unless he ever decides it to be in his best emotional and mental interest. In doing so I know I\u2019m somewhat robbing myself of the opportunity to fully move on, but the thought of him working through this completely alone is far too much for me to live with. We have varying levels of darkness in our lives, but being strong for him is easy because he has already been the epitome of comfort for me in some of my hardest days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not completely certain why I\u2019m throwing this narrative into the vast void of the Internet, seeing as I\u2019ve yet to find comfort in thousands of other words from every source imaginable. Maybe I just need to know that I\u2019m not alone, or hear that someone else can hear the hurt in my words and understand it would take an especially different kind of person to create those kinds of emotional wounds.

But what I think more than anything is that I need reassurance that having hope in love and the strength of our bond is not foolish, no matter how much it can feel that way sometimes. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ghxsh", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "\u201cNever tell me the odds.\u201d : Am I Stubborn or Stupid for Truly Believing Mental Illness Can\u2019t Ruin Our Relationship?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7ghxsh", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7ghxsh/never_tell_me_the_odds_am_i_stubborn_or_stupid/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512028530.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7ghxsh/never_tell_me_the_odds_am_i_stubborn_or_stupid/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "AnnieK04", "created_utc": 1511999730.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m male, 23, from the UK, and I can&amp;#39;t believe what I&amp;#39;m writing.

I&amp;#39;ll be graduating in few months. I&amp;#39;m pretty smart if you ask me(lol). but, seriously, I&amp;#39;m always among the top performers in anything that I take part in.

The reason I&amp;#39;m mentioning all these things is that, I&amp;#39;m smarter than the general population and among my peers too.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no problem with cognitive memory, i.e., anything to do with Facts, Statistics, Abstract/Conceptual thinking etc.. I remember the capitals of almost 150 countries even though it&amp;#39;s been years since I&amp;#39;ve learnt them. I could quote sentences, dialogues, passages from books, TV shows and movies. So, basically my cognitive memory is pretty intact and I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem remembering anything that I studied or saw somewhere... Ok that would establish my Sanity(lol)/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the problem.. I have something called SDAM(Severely Deficient Autobiographic memory) which is a memory disorder where people with this condition don&amp;#39;t have or rather don&amp;#39;t remember most of their PAST... Here&amp;#39;s an article that would give you a general understanding of this condition &lt;a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/04/susie-mckinnon-autobiographical-memory-sdam/\"&gt;https://www.wired.com/2016/04/susie-mckinnon-autobiographical-memory-sdam/&lt;/a&gt;\nA simple google search would further explain this condition..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s what it means, I don&amp;#39;t have a single first person experience from my past. That is I don&amp;#39;t remember a single day of my school as myself. That is, you can ask me what school I studied in, and I would tell you the answer. it&amp;#39;s because that is a memory linked to fact i.e., my school name, area etc. Like this you could ask me if I ever smoked a cigarette as a teenager. I could tell you, NO i didn&amp;#39;t because, factually I know I haven&amp;#39;t smoked in the past.. But this is pretty much where it ends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember what it felt like to win a competition( I know I won a few), I don&amp;#39;t remember what it felt like all those years I spent with my friends ( I know I spent a lot of years with my school buddies).. This is the entire disorder... I don&amp;#39;t have any first person experience of anything from my past.. This is like basically removing the &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; aspect of a memory and being left with just a storage drive that tells you what happened in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, here&amp;#39;s where I currently face problems with this condition. I&amp;#39;m 21 now. For the first time, I moved out of my city, state for my university. I thought it would be hard, but as it turns out.. Within the first two weeks, I almost forgot everything that I did in my hometown.. My friends, classmates, city everything just faded in my memory as if they never existed.. I can&amp;#39;t recollect a single memory of my life there.. I can&amp;#39;t relive a single moment I spent with my friends.. So naturally, I stopped chatting, talking with my old buds because it felt I didn&amp;#39;t know them at all.. I&amp;#39;ve had this condition as far as I can remember, but only a year ago I understood what it actually is.. Another example is, I was 13 years old and my sister got married. After she moved out, it was like she never existed in my life, I couldn&amp;#39;t recollect a memory of her in our house. Until some time ago, I thought this was how memories worked for people and it was how life is..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s where the problem lies. This condition has made me feel no emotions towards people, places, events in life - whatsoever.. Since childhood my parents used to ask me to come out to movies, parties, relatives houses etc. But I was never interested.. I always thought I was an introvert and didn&amp;#39;t like meeting people all the time.. But only recently have I discovered that I used to forget about the people I met in the past and how I acted among them. This became a big issue, because last year I broke up with my gf. She was my first gf. So naturally, within a week or two, I couldn&amp;#39;t even remember how we used to talk to each other or how we acted just as two people in a relationship.. Even some months into my relationship, I couldn&amp;#39;t remember how we met, or how we flirted before, or how the proposal occured.. NOTHING.... This too had an effect on my relationship and was one of the reasons for the break-up, as I started getting more detached and &amp;quot;Unknown&amp;quot;..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Finally one more important point.. I am also a &amp;quot;Sociopath&amp;quot;. Which means, I would want great control in a relationship for it to even smoothly function.. Due to Sociopathy+SDAM I&amp;#39;m literally unable to maintain any relationships whatsoever. I constantly keep changing my friends.. i don&amp;#39;t have a single childhood or teenage friends. I have changed my place in my classroom 5 times in the last 3 years, cuz after each vacation I would have no idea who these people are like. So I move on to other side of the class. Right now my circle is my classmates. And I know in 6 months after graduation I won&amp;#39;t be talking to anyone of these people for the rest of my life..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;#39;m considering not to ever enter into any relationship, romantic or even just friendship.. because i know how these are going to end.. In a few months my inner sociopath kicks in and I don&amp;#39;t have any memory of the past to have any control over the relationship or any true meaning either.. I also lost interest in TRAVEL completely because I never remember what it felt like visiting a historical monument or a beautiful waterfalls. While everyone else narrates their pleasant memories.. It&amp;#39;s completely pointless acc to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.. yeah.. That&amp;#39;s my situation right now,, And I know there is no &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; for this.. This is just how I&amp;#39;m wired.. Maybe you can share your thoughts.... Again sorry for the v.v. long post... (Writing as I&amp;#39;m thinking..

I spend a lot of time depressed, and frittering away precious time in escapism, BUT I also do a lot with my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working two jobs, going to AA meetings, working the steps (could do better on that front I suppose), NOT DRINKING, working out regularly and intensely (for the most part), cooking often, always striving to clean more and take care of all those little to-do list items (take out the recycling, tidy room, laundry) instead of letting them linger...but...it&amp;#39;s....never...good...enough&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, sure, I workout and have for 15 years! That&amp;#39;s better than most people, right? I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; feel good about myself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, the perfectionism won&amp;#39;t let me get away that easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I&amp;#39;m depressed, alcoholic, anxious, traumatized, etc etc etc and just having the time and energy and opportunity to work out is awesome. Here is a snapshot of the mental craziness around one aspect of my life in which perfectionism, depression, and shame rear their ugly head every day, THE GYM! (also sometimes the outdoor calisthenics park):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Am not focusing enough on results/outcomes/quality of my workouts/consistent progress&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) My nutrition is always wavering back and forth, healthy unhealthy, PLUS with everything I &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; about nutrition, I&amp;#39;ve figured out a way to feel bad about almost anything I put in my mouth, even the time at which I do it.

I spend a lot of time depressed, and frittering away precious time in escapism, BUT I also do a lot with my time.\n\nI'm working two jobs, going to AA meetings, working the steps (could do better on that front I suppose), NOT DRINKING, working out regularly and intensely (for the most part), cooking often, always striving to clean more and take care of all those little to-do list items (take out the recycling, tidy room, laundry) instead of letting them linger...but...it's....never...good...enough\n\nFor example, sure, I workout and have for 15 years! That's better than most people, right? I *should* feel good about myself!\n\nBut, the perfectionism won't let me get away that easy.\n\nEven though I'm depressed, alcoholic, anxious, traumatized, etc etc etc and just having the time and energy and opportunity to work out is awesome. Here is a snapshot of the mental craziness around one aspect of my life in which perfectionism, depression, and shame rear their ugly head every day, THE GYM! (also sometimes the outdoor calisthenics park):\n\n1) Am not focusing enough on results/outcomes/quality of my workouts/consistent progress\n\n2) My nutrition is always wavering back and forth, healthy unhealthy, PLUS with everything I \"know\" about nutrition, I've figured out a way to feel bad about almost anything I put in my mouth, even the time at which I do it. So much stress over the mere act of eating! Am I bulking? Cutting? Why does it matter? Can't I just eat? Well am I eating enough? Not enough? What are my \"goals\" anyway? I can't stick to \"goals\" with stuff like this long term anyway, what's the point. I *should* just gut it out, \"DO IT\", all that, because that's the only way I'll improve....but...I...just...can't...even though I have in spurts, overall, it's as if this beast of \"I CAN'T\" just wants to drag me back down to hell, every damn time\n\n3) WHAT IF ONE DAY I GET INJURED OR LOSE ACCESS TO A GYM AND CANT WORKOUT THEN IT WILL ALL BE FOR NAUGHT WHATS THE POINT (I know that I don't need a gym to workout out and that it's the journey and how I feel NOW and not the destination that matters, I didn't say this shit was rational)\n\n4) I'm always so damned lethargic and depressed that just getting through the workout has been a nightmare for almost all of those 15 years.

We left things on good terms and she said that she hoped we met again when things were different. I was hesitant to start dating because I still felt an obligation to this person who was my best friend and  I had married.

On my way too and from work there is an incline in the road where it goes over a large ditch/railroad tracks. there is a guardrail at its peak but plenty of room before that to drive off road and fall into the ditch. Or the thought of turning sharply into the divider on the highway. Or jumping when I am on the ledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am afraid that it is suicidal in nature even though I do not feel this way when the triggering stimuli isn&amp;#39;t around. Because I don&amp;#39;t feel like ending my life, more the &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; of the dangerous situation, I really don&amp;#39;t think its suicide related.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also suffer from a lot of anxiety and I wonder if it is some sort of crossing in the fight or flight reactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\"L'appel du vide\" is that sensation when you are at the edge of a cliff and you wonder what it would be like to jump.\n\nI am depressed.

He family \n and friends abandoned her because they didn't understand that she didn't abandon them, that she snapped and thought the only solution was to run away. The girl I was on the date with understood my situation, was ok with it, until she realized that she wasn't (she was amazingly honest about it, that she was surprised that she couldn't be more understanding). We left things on good terms and she said that she hoped we met again when things were different. I was hesitant to start dating because I still felt an obligation to this person who was my best friend and  I had married. Its baggage I didn't want to burden anyone with but now she is in a stable place, we gave our relationship another try, and we are both on the same page that it doesn't work between us (no matter how much we care about each other or how good the sex is). So I'm ready...but I don't have the energy, mentally or physically.\n\nAnd then there is l'appel du vide. Right now I do not feel it. I am not suicidal (as far as I am aware) but when I'm driving or near a ledge that thought/sensation is often. I only ever felt it on rare occasions in the past. Once now and then, but now it is every time I drive, sometimes multiple times. On my way too and from work there is an incline in the road where it goes over a large ditch/railroad tracks. there is a guardrail at its peak but plenty of room before that to drive off road and fall into the ditch. Or the thought of turning sharply into the divider on the highway. Or jumping when I am on the ledge.\n\nI am afraid that it is suicidal in nature even though I do not feel this way when the triggering stimuli isn't around. Because I don't feel like ending my life, more the \"what if\" of the dangerous situation, I really don't think its suicide related.\n\nI also suffer from a lot of anxiety and I wonder if it is some sort of crossing in the fight or flight reactions.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gahg2", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "L'appel du vide est fort. \"The call of the void is strong.\"", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gahg2", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7gahg2/lappel_du_vide_est_fort_the_call_of_the_void_is/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1511958035.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7gahg2/lappel_du_vide_est_fort_the_call_of_the_void_is/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Th3Dux", "created_utc": 1511929235.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started Lexapro last night because I have begun to develop moderately severe depression and have always had GAD/panic disorder.

But these thoughts have been consistent since long before both events, so I believe they are unrelated. Please, before you tell me to suck it up, realize I've been doing this for 10 years. Nothing has changed.

I&amp;#39;m a 22 year old guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After spending some time unemployed, single and back at my mums house I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of time to be introspective and try to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on in my mind. I&amp;#39;ve always had trouble holding down jobs and relationships but I&amp;#39;ve never really known why, I&amp;#39;ve always just felt guilty about it and as if I&amp;#39;m inferior in some way. I&amp;#39;m the same with hobbies, I pretty much have no skills I&amp;#39;m proud of because I always put things down too quickly, I just can&amp;#39;t stick to anything no matter how hard I try. After reading up about an issue I was diagnosed with as a kid, Dysgraphia, I ended up being drawn in by the claim that apparently Dysgraphia tends to go hand in hand with other issues such as autism or ADHD. After reading about both of these for quite some time, I&amp;#39;ve come to the conclusion it&amp;#39;s very possible I have both Aspergers and ADHD. I was always a really shy kid, but this has led me to being an incredibly socially awkward guy who has always struggled with social situations. I dropped out of university because I couldn&amp;#39;t handle the depression that came from feeling so isolated and admittedly jealous at all the people around me seeming to have no troubles at all when it came to being social. I tried so many times to be one of the typical student types, going out drinking and partying, making new friends, but I always felt constantly anxious and like I didn&amp;#39;t fit in with anybody, and the battle of finally getting the courage to actually go through with the plan to go out and be social wore me down immensely. When I try to talk to somebody I&amp;#39;m not already comfortable with, my brain just doesn&amp;#39;t work. I try my best but I just have no idea what to say, my brain gives me nothing to go off it just goes blank. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle going out clubbing, and being around so many people in general made me very physically uncomfortable. This started to lead to a lot of hatred towards the world in general. I felt like the world was a very sinister place and no matter how hard I would try there was no place for me. I still feel this to an extent, but I know there&amp;#39;s some hope at least. My mum tried to get me tested for autism as a young kid as I was pretty damn strange and had some very odd habits but apparently the doctor just looked at me and said I wasn&amp;#39;t autistic. I actually carried one of my habits through with me to adulthood, the constant need to fiddle with something. I feel like I can&amp;#39;t concentrate on stuff properly unless I&amp;#39;m fiddling with something, usually a straw or something similar to that. This is one of the main reasons I think I might have ADHD, alongside the lack of motivation and ability to stick to things, and I believe the only reason I lack some kind of obsession like most people with Aspergers is because of my inability to pay attention to something for that amount of time. It&amp;#39;s like the worst of both worlds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My most recent relationship failed because I became distant, this is because I started smoking weed. It seemed like the only thing that made me feel better and I started abusing it, luckily I&amp;#39;ve fallen out of the habit of abuse but I still smoke every couple of weeks to try to have a spiritual experience with it, meditating and such, it was actually weed that seemed to show me the way to these conclusions and got me thinking really deeply about my own life and what I need to do to succeed. Due to these issues making me feel inferior to everybody around me, since I was around 16 life just kind of lost its magic. I stopped enjoying things as much, I haven&amp;#39;t felt strong feelings for anything much since and it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m living life through a screen. Seeing it but not really feeling it. I tried to get help for depression in the past, but because I hadn&amp;#39;t had suicidal thoughts of self harmed the doctor just said I needed to get out more. I tried, I really did, but it seems like everything I try to do is just set to fail because my own brain seems to fight against me. I can&amp;#39;t stick to any kind of habit for more than a week or so, and when I try to stick to a job I just get so exhausted by it in the same way other people would after years. I ended up being sacked from my last job because I had too much time off as some days I just feel like I can&amp;#39;t mentally handle leaving my room, being out in the world constantly drains me to the point where it makes me physically ill. From the outside I know I seem like a lazy unmotivated guy with no aspirations, but in my mind that&amp;#39;s not true at all. I&amp;#39;m constantly beating myself up about the fact that I&amp;#39;m not doing anything, and I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been born with a dysfunctional brain and there&amp;#39;s no hope for me. I try to go out into the world and be successful but my brain tries its best to stop me with the lack of emotions apart from constant anxiety and the lack of motivation, and if I stay in my room I get anxious and depressed about the fact that I&amp;#39;m stuck here against my will, as if my own brain is keeping me prisoner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now feel like I&amp;#39;m stuck at the bottom of a pit with no way out, but I&amp;#39;m feeling inspired to try to get help for these things. I just have no idea what to say to the doctor to try to get help. When I try to talk to a doctor I run into the same problems I do with new people, my mind just goes blank and I end up telling them about 5% of what I wanted to say and feeling like I&amp;#39;ve been misdiagnosed because they didn&amp;#39;t get the full picture.

She\u2019s cute, funny, we get along great and she has a BF who lives out of town.  I stay out of her way and no problems arise until her BF breaks it off (2 months-ish into my tenancy).  A few weeks in and low and behold after some beverages things get intimate.  We continue this intimacy for the duration of the year but I was also seeing others and she knew about it and said it didn\u2019t bother her (they never came to my house).  I had repeated attempts to stop things with F as I was beginning to see it had a negative effect on her but she was adamant that it didn\u2019t and the convenience of it all was too much for my rubber arm.  I go away for the summer to work and come back and find new housing reasonably close to F.  For the first 1-2 months we had been continuing on as before but it became clear that this needed to stop and I was still engaged with others, one in particular with increasing regularity.  So I stopped sleeping with her but with hopes to retain the friendship as we had shared and spent lots of time together and I knew she had few friends and literally none in town that knew/could deal with her issues.  Now I\u2019ve known for a long time that F suffers from anxiety and depression.  During our time together things seemed better for her with little to no episodes, she had no issues getting to work/school on her own and wouldn\u2019t stay in bed all day unable to get out.  Fast forward to now about 2-2.5 months since no sexual activity between us and she is miserable.  Often unable to get out of bed, missing work/school and in need of \u201cpep talks\u201d and constant comforting.  Now this is the part that I imagine I\u2019m going to get shit on for, I constantly cave (3-4 nights a week) and allow her to come over and sleep in my bed because she\u2019s upset.  Let me be clear, NOTHING even remotely romantic has happened in 2-2.5 months.  She comes over, cuddles and we go on about our day.  I check in with her often to see how she\u2019s doing (daily) and often and it\u2019s usually bad and that ends up with her coming over to spend the night.  Now I am involved in a considerably difficult degree that absorbs the vast majority of my free time and with finals approaching I am worried about what to do as I do not want her coming over increasing stress and reducing my sleep (I don\u2019t sleep well with another in the bed and certainly not this situation).  I absolutely want what\u2019s best for her but also I can\u2019t sink myself in the process.

I have been making frantic calls to psychiatrists in the area but getting an appointment, on time or not, is difficult in our narrow network. \n\nI already feel terrible. Just as bad as before or worse. I know that a lot of these feelings are just my brain having withdrawal symptoms but holy fuck this is terrible. How did I live like this? I wish I had my medication back. I was productive and attentive. I am back to binge eating and not doing anything all day. I\u2019m having to do this in the middle of the busiest month of the year for me, and I\u2019m only scraping by because I have no other alternative. I have events to run and a job to work and a household to run. Every little thing sends me into a spiral. I misplaced my brand new nice sunglasses that I got for my honeymoon and I have felt awful about it for four days. I don\u2019t want to leave the house over all this. My husband has an insane work schedule right now and obviously is having no fun dealing with me right now so I don\u2019t want to bug him too much. \n\nAny coping mechanisms/tips for tapering off? I know it\u2019s not endless and I\u2019ll have an appointment eventually and get back on them but it could be several weeks to a month or more.

I am pretty sensitive as a guy which I can admit but there is more to it than that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago in high school I have a presentation to a class of about 20 or less students. I was fully prepared, I did a ton of research for a high school project, I had notecards of what I was going to say, and I got a good grade on the project. Despite all of this, when I was presented I froze. My knees trembled I couldn\u2019t figure out what I was going to say nothing sounded right my voice was shaky honestly it\u2019s been the most visibly nervous I\u2019ve ever been. That\u2019s where I started to re-evaluate my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not uncommon for me to have nightmares for consecutive nights or multiple times in one night. Sometimes in my dreams I can tell I am screaming during my sleep. I cannot remember all the details of every nightmare, but my most recent one, I was in a forest full of giant snakes with my family and I got caught in the ground and a giant snake was moving towards me and I called out for my dad but he couldn\u2019t hear me even though he was right there and then I was attacked and woke up. Maybe it\u2019s nothing but I just having so many nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time speaking out in a group of more than three people (including myself) or around people I do not know which is pretty normal for anyone but I just can\u2019t put myself out there because I do I think about it for days on end cringing at what I said no matter how small it was. I usually think about how people think of me based of what I said. Like \u201cwow this dude thinks he so smart but really isn\u2019t\u201d and more stuff like that which brings me into my next issues which I can remember very vividly cringy things I did in the past, without consciously doing it, I will say something under my breath like \u201cI hate myself\u201d or \u201cnigger\u201d (I think I try to shock myself outta it by using slang I have nothing against any race) and it happens quite frequently I\u2019d say 3-5 times a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not think I had the greatest of childhoods either. When I was 10 or 11 my grandma lost her life to depression and suicide. I do not know how much this affected me because I hardly remember much about her either than she was my babysitter when my parents were working I would go there. My happiest moments in life happened at that daycare, days I think about to make myself. Then a few months later my other grandma died to cancer and I remember staying at her house it was very apparent that she cared about me. I have older brother (21) and a younger sister (16). And I remember vividly being picked on by my older brother constantly. When I was about 12 he would take my phone, no matter how hard I would struggle he always got it, and would read all my messages between me and girls and just make fun of me for fun. It was a brutal fucking hell for an awkward preteen. My parents never would help me or were never around I was always teased picked on bullied beat up or just the fucking butt end of fucking joke. On the other side of the spectrum when I tried to pull that shit on my sister (because life goes in cycles and I was an asshole) I would immediately be punished, I would be grounded get my phone taken away and locked up in a room no matter how benign the comment was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for my parents, as the middle child it is common to be forgotten, but I never felt noticed unless I would act out which i didn\u2019t enjoy. My mom, I feel like her life would be completely different if she didn\u2019t have kids. I feel like a prop in her life. My accomplishments are her accomplishments she will brag to her friends about things I did which sounds great but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s like a fucking competition with these women. They\u2019re always fighting to have the best kid. I don\u2019t feel like sharing anything with her anymore and she resents it. She tries to get any piece of information of success out of my. I\u2019d rather not say anything to her. Anytime I see walk by her at home she acts my the most arbitrary and trivial questions which I give one word answers to but they never stop. I will be asked 30 questions within 5 minutes and I have counted before. I feel like my mom is a borderline narcissist. I have told her before that I don\u2019t like when she uses me as a prop and she guilted me into letting her do whatever she wants. She has gone through my room and found condoms in my room and felt the need to share it with my entire family not just my brother sister but my aunts uncles and cousins that she found condoms in my room. Just last week she went through my bank statement in the mail and shared how much money I spent with everyone at thanksgiving. Most of it went to books but not all. My dad is probably were some of my lack of anger management comes from. I was 11-13 at the time my family went to Disney world on vacation. During this time I was not a big fan of rollercoasters and I didn\u2019t really like to ride them so I perfectly content with just waiting at the exit for them when they got off but for some reason that made my dad unhappy and he told me \u201cyou\u2019re ruining everyone\u2019s vacation\u201d. I did absolutely nothing wrong why would anyone say that to their child? I remember my brother was talking back to my dad but we had to go to a basketball game because we were on the team and my brother got the final word in but when he and I were leaving to go the game my dad comes out of the house and gives me brother a shot to the face that bruised his face pretty bad. My mom ended up driving me to the game and my brother turned up later with some lie about where the bruise came from. This was a stressful time in my parents live they got caught up in some bad business and ended being sued, going bankrupt, and losing everything so I can\u2019t blame him completely but the damage was already done.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has definitely been a chain of depression in my family from my grandma to my brother and my sister. When I was 15 my brother and I shared a room. One day I woke up and he was gone. He tried to kill himself and my grandpa found him before any damage could be done he was eventually hospitalized but I unfortunately saw the suicide note which was definitely tough but I do not know how much this actually affected me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the things that I think about.

I know I am a bright kid 19 [M]. But I just cannot figure out what is wrong with me. I am pretty sensitive as a guy which I can admit but there is more to it than that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year ago in high school I have a presentation to a class of about 20 or less students. I was fully prepared, I did a ton of research for a high school project, I had notecards of what I was going to say, and I got a good grade on the project. Despite all of this, when I was presented I froze. My knees trembled I couldn\u2019t figure out what I was going to say nothing sounded right my voice was shaky honestly it\u2019s been the most visibly nervous I\u2019ve ever been. That\u2019s where I started to re-evaluate my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not uncommon for me to have nightmares for consecutive nights or multiple times in one night. Sometimes in my dreams I can tell I am screaming during my sleep. I cannot remember all the details of every nightmare, but my most recent one, I was in a forest full of giant snakes with my family and I got caught in the ground and a giant snake was moving towards me and I called out for my dad but he couldn\u2019t hear me even though he was right there and then I was attacked and woke up. Maybe it\u2019s nothing but I just having so many nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time speaking out in a group of more than three people (including myself) or around people I do not know which is pretty normal for anyone but I just can\u2019t put myself out there because I do I think about it for days on end cringing at what I said no matter how small it was. I usually think about how people think of me based of what I said. Like \u201cwow this dude thinks he so smart but really isn\u2019t\u201d and more stuff like that which brings me into my next issues which I can remember very vividly cringy things I did in the past, without consciously doing it, I will say something under my breath like \u201cI hate myself\u201d or \u201cnigger\u201d (I think I try to shock myself outta it by using slang I have nothing against any race) and it happens quite frequently I\u2019d say 3-5 times a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not think I had the greatest of childhoods either. When I was 10 or 11 my grandma lost her life to depression and suicide. I do not know how much this affected me because I hardly remember much about her either than she was my babysitter when my parents were working I would go there. My happiest moments in life happened at that daycare, days I think about to make myself. Then a few months later my other grandma died to cancer and I remember staying at her house it was very apparent that she cared about me. I have older brother (21) and a younger sister (16). And I remember vividly being picked on by my older brother constantly. When I was about 12 he would take my phone, no matter how hard I would struggle he always got it, and would read all my messages between me and girls and just make fun of me for fun. It was a brutal fucking hell for an awkward preteen. My parents never would help me or were never around I was always teased picked on bullied beat up or just the fucking butt end of fucking joke. On the other side of the spectrum when I tried to pull that shit on my sister (because life goes in cycles and I was an asshole) I would immediately be punished, I would be grounded get my phone taken away and locked up in a room no matter how benign the comment was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for my parents, as the middle child it is common to be forgotten, but I never felt noticed unless I would act out which i didn\u2019t enjoy. My mom, I feel like her life would be completely different if she didn\u2019t have kids. I feel like a prop in her life. My accomplishments are her accomplishments she will brag to her friends about things I did which sounds great but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s like a fucking competition with these women. They\u2019re always fighting to have the best kid. I don\u2019t feel like sharing anything with her anymore and she resents it. She tries to get any piece of information of success out of my. I\u2019d rather not say anything to her. Anytime I see walk by her at home she acts my the most arbitrary and trivial questions which I give one word answers to but they never stop. I will be asked 30 questions within 5 minutes and I have counted before. I feel like my mom is a borderline narcissist. I have told her before that I don\u2019t like when she uses me as a prop and she guilted me into letting her do whatever she wants. She has gone through my room and found condoms in my room and felt the need to share it with my entire family not just my brother sister but my aunts uncles and cousins that she found condoms in my room. Just last week she went through my bank statement in the mail and shared how much money I spent with everyone at thanksgiving. Most of it went to books but not all. My dad is probably were some of my lack of anger management comes from. I was 11-13 at the time my family went to Disney world on vacation. During this time I was not a big fan of rollercoasters and I didn\u2019t really like to ride them so I perfectly content with just waiting at the exit for them when they got off but for some reason that made my dad unhappy and he told me \u201cyou\u2019re ruining everyone\u2019s vacation\u201d. I did absolutely nothing wrong why would anyone say that to their child? I remember my brother was talking back to my dad but we had to go to a basketball game because we were on the team and my brother got the final word in but when he and I were leaving to go the game my dad comes out of the house and gives me brother a shot to the face that bruised his face pretty bad. My mom ended up driving me to the game and my brother turned up later with some lie about where the bruise came from. This was a stressful time in my parents live they got caught up in some bad business and ended being sued, going bankrupt, and losing everything so I can\u2019t blame him completely but the damage was already done.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has definitely been a chain of depression in my family from my grandma to my brother and my sister. When I was 15 my brother and I shared a room. One day I woke up and he was gone. He tried to kill himself and my grandpa found him before any damage could be done he was eventually hospitalized but I unfortunately saw the suicide note which was definitely tough but I do not know how much this actually affected me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the things that I think about. I am not sure if I got too side tracked I just tried to give a little background to my life and maybe that would be able to help maybe I should see a therapist maybe I am just an asshole maybe I have anxiety I do not know but I just want answers so I can fix this hell that haunts me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So about a year ago I had a lot of time to reflect on my life and what is actually wrong with me so I can stop limiting my potential. I know I am a bright kid 19 [M]. But I just cannot figure out what is wrong with me. I am pretty sensitive as a guy which I can admit but there is more to it than that. \n\nAbout a year ago in high school I have a presentation to a class of about 20 or less students. I was fully prepared, I did a ton of research for a high school project, I had notecards of what I was going to say, and I got a good grade on the project. Despite all of this, when I was presented I froze. My knees trembled I couldn\u2019t figure out what I was going to say nothing sounded right my voice was shaky honestly it\u2019s been the most visibly nervous I\u2019ve ever been. That\u2019s where I started to re-evaluate my life. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to have nightmares for consecutive nights or multiple times in one night. Sometimes in my dreams I can tell I am screaming during my sleep. I cannot remember all the details of every nightmare, but my most recent one, I was in a forest full of giant snakes with my family and I got caught in the ground and a giant snake was moving towards me and I called out for my dad but he couldn\u2019t hear me even though he was right there and then I was attacked and woke up. Maybe it\u2019s nothing but I just having so many nightmares. \n\nI have a hard time speaking out in a group of more than three people (including myself) or around people I do not know which is pretty normal for anyone but I just can\u2019t put myself out there because I do I think about it for days on end cringing at what I said no matter how small it was. I usually think about how people think of me based of what I said. Like \u201cwow this dude thinks he so smart but really isn\u2019t\u201d and more stuff like that which brings me into my next issues which I can remember very vividly cringy things I did in the past, without consciously doing it, I will say something under my breath like \u201cI hate myself\u201d or \u201cnigger\u201d (I think I try to shock myself outta it by using slang I have nothing against any race) and it happens quite frequently I\u2019d say 3-5 times a day. \n\nI do not think I had the greatest of childhoods either. When I was 10 or 11 my grandma lost her life to depression and suicide. I do not know how much this affected me because I hardly remember much about her either than she was my babysitter when my parents were working I would go there. My happiest moments in life happened at that daycare, days I think about to make myself. Then a few months later my other grandma died to cancer and I remember staying at her house it was very apparent that she cared about me. I have older brother (21) and a younger sister (16). And I remember vividly being picked on by my older brother constantly. When I was about 12 he would take my phone, no matter how hard I would struggle he always got it, and would read all my messages between me and girls and just make fun of me for fun. It was a brutal fucking hell for an awkward preteen. My parents never would help me or were never around I was always teased picked on bullied beat up or just the fucking butt end of fucking joke. On the other side of the spectrum when I tried to pull that shit on my sister (because life goes in cycles and I was an asshole) I would immediately be punished, I would be grounded get my phone taken away and locked up in a room no matter how benign the comment was. \n\nNow for my parents, as the middle child it is common to be forgotten, but I never felt noticed unless I would act out which i didn\u2019t enjoy. My mom, I feel like her life would be completely different if she didn\u2019t have kids. I feel like a prop in her life. My accomplishments are her accomplishments she will brag to her friends about things I did which sounds great but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s like a fucking competition with these women. They\u2019re always fighting to have the best kid. I don\u2019t feel like sharing anything with her anymore and she resents it. She tries to get any piece of information of success out of my. I\u2019d rather not say anything to her. Anytime I see walk by her at home she acts my the most arbitrary and trivial questions which I give one word answers to but they never stop. I will be asked 30 questions within 5 minutes and I have counted before. I feel like my mom is a borderline narcissist. I have told her before that I don\u2019t like when she uses me as a prop and she guilted me into letting her do whatever she wants. She has gone through my room and found condoms in my room and felt the need to share it with my entire family not just my brother sister but my aunts uncles and cousins that she found condoms in my room. Just last week she went through my bank statement in the mail and shared how much money I spent with everyone at thanksgiving. Most of it went to books but not all. My dad is probably were some of my lack of anger management comes from. I was 11-13 at the time my family went to Disney world on vacation. During this time I was not a big fan of rollercoasters and I didn\u2019t really like to ride them so I perfectly content with just waiting at the exit for them when they got off but for some reason that made my dad unhappy and he told me \u201cyou\u2019re ruining everyone\u2019s vacation\u201d. I did absolutely nothing wrong why would anyone say that to their child? I remember my brother was talking back to my dad but we had to go to a basketball game because we were on the team and my brother got the final word in but when he and I were leaving to go the game my dad comes out of the house and gives me brother a shot to the face that bruised his face pretty bad. My mom ended up driving me to the game and my brother turned up later with some lie about where the bruise came from. This was a stressful time in my parents live they got caught up in some bad business and ended being sued, going bankrupt, and losing everything so I can\u2019t blame him completely but the damage was already done.  \n\nThere has definitely been a chain of depression in my family from my grandma to my brother and my sister. When I was 15 my brother and I shared a room. One day I woke up and he was gone. He tried to kill himself and my grandpa found him before any damage could be done he was eventually hospitalized but I unfortunately saw the suicide note which was definitely tough but I do not know how much this actually affected me. \n\nThese are just some of the things that I think about. I am not sure if I got too side tracked I just tried to give a little background to my life and maybe that would be able to help maybe I should see a therapist maybe I am just an asshole maybe I have anxiety I do not know but I just want answers so I can fix this hell that haunts me.

I have panic and anxiety disorders, which sometimes makes my life very difficult sometimes. It&amp;#39;s getting better though. So, to the story: I was dying my hair last night, and my boyfriend was about to visit me. He lives very close to me. One of the doors which I can use to enter my building, is almost next to my apartment door. So, he let me know that he is behind the door and I went to open it for him, left my door slightly open cause I have three dogs, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to leave the door fully open cause then they would run after me. I have done this maaaany times. Then, when I open the door to my boyfriend, the air pressure from opening the door slams my door and shuts it. I started freaking out very badly, and had a major panic attack. So, I was wearing my undies, a tunic that barely covers my butt, have the hair color on my head, and then the freaking door decides to shut itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I started panicking, I just lost the sense of everything. I was just half yelling at my boyfriend and running around, and he got angry with me. I wasn&amp;#39;t even able to use his phone to make a phone call! Then he aided me with that and I had to call the call center to get my sister&amp;#39;s number, and then I called her husband cause they didn&amp;#39;t find my sister&amp;#39;s number. Then my sister&amp;#39;s husband agreed to drive to my place and give me the keys. At this point my bf had gone to his apartment to get me a jacket and a pair of shoes, so that I can go to his place while waiting for the keys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was just crying the whole time, and when we went to his place, I went straight to the shower to rinse off the hair colour. After that my bf kept on being angry at me, and tried to make me do deep breaths, and I wasn&amp;#39;t even able to do that. After 10 minutes, I calmed down and things were starting to get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after an hour or so, my sister&amp;#39;s hubby brought me the keys and I got back to the flat. I&amp;#39;m kinda disappointed and sad that when I had a panic attack, my bf got angry. I need my other half to stay calm when I&amp;#39;m losing it. I get it that I was being a douche when I had it, but I can&amp;#39;t control that cause that was one of the worst panic attacks I&amp;#39;ve ever had. I understand him and how he is angry at me, but in my opinion he should try to understand that this is not something I do on purpose. Of course we talked about it when I calmed down and I emphasized to him that I&amp;#39;m not doing this shit on purpose. We agreed with the fact that he just doesn&amp;#39;t understand what a panic attack is, although he had some minor ones when he was younger. The attacks aren&amp;#39;t something you can explain, and not something that anyone can understand if they haven&amp;#39;t experienced them themselves. Then he inquired me very quickly that how am I going to prevent the next time that I panic for an hour? I said I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m going to therapy with my issues, and I said I&amp;#39;m going to talk about it there. Maybe my therapist can give me thoughts how I can stop them faster. I&amp;#39;m planning on taking my bf with me to one of my therapy sessions, so that my therapist could give him some tips on how to understand my panic attacks better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The attack I had tonight, was cause my dogs were inside my flat alone, and I got a new dog few months back and she&amp;#39;s eating everything she can! So, since my hair color was there I was afraid that she&amp;#39;d eat that and get poisoned or something..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the question is, I don&amp;#39;t know how to proceed after this. How can I make my boyfriend understand this? It&amp;#39;s not like I get these very often, but my anxiety causes me to think shitty stuff pretty regularly, although it&amp;#39;s getting better. Has any of you had similar issues of your significant other not understanding your mental issues? How did you overcome them? Any tips, hints or comments are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I got a major panic attack for getting locked out from my apartment with no keys, my boyfriend got mad about it.

I was sent to counselling therapy to talk about my issues and recieved a diagnosis for Paranoia, Anxiety and Depression. After a few months, I stopped attending - it was during this time I was still going through my abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years on, I&amp;#39;ve only struggled more and more, confused and scared for years.

I am aware of how many illnesses can possess psychotic like symptoms, I&amp;#39;m not stating I have psychosis whatsoever, however reading up and hearing about people&amp;#39;s past experiences that made my stomach sink as I began to get lost in what felt like someone writing out my own memories. From this I conclude one of two things, either I am SEVERELY struggling with my anxiety and depression, or my mental health isn&amp;#39;t what I&amp;#39;ve been lead to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a multitude of breakdowns around 6 months ago and that&amp;#39;s when I realised how much it was taking over my life, controlling it, ruining it.

Deep down I know that it&amp;#39;s only there for the money, as another corporation role playing their game in society to keep the world going round. But I need help. I don&amp;#39;t have the support of friends to talk to anymore (actually due to an outburst of my symptoms) and my family neglect the fact, they just tell me I&amp;#39;m weak and an embarrassment / let down. It&amp;#39;s taken me 6 months since that realisation that I need to talk to someone, yet I cannot manage to make the call, I&amp;#39;m too scared. And no one I can ask will make it for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel stupid in myself, not because I need help, but because I&amp;#39;m resorting to the one place I swore I&amp;#39;d never dare go, especially about this however this is essentially my last option. I&amp;#39;ve spent months exploiting everything possible, there is nothing on the first 10 pages of google that I haven&amp;#39;t seen if it&amp;#39;s regarding any form of self help to mental health. I&amp;#39;ve even completely changed my cultural beliefs within so much deep searching (previously being a dead-set atheist and science geek) to a spiritually awoken, open minded believer of many things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to talk to a GP, I want to talk to a psychologist or someone of a mental health profession, someone who will take me seriously. I don&amp;#39;t want my GP to know about all of my symptoms but I need to get help. How do I talk to my GP to make him see the extent without the details?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S Paying for a psychologist is out of the window (to begin with at least).

I don't have the support of friends to talk to anymore (actually due to an outburst of my symptoms) and my family neglect the fact, they just tell me I'm weak and an embarrassment / let down. It's taken me 6 months since that realisation that I need to talk to someone, yet I cannot manage to make the call, I'm too scared. And no one I can ask will make it for me.\n\nI feel stupid in myself, not because I need help, but because I'm resorting to the one place I swore I'd never dare go, especially about this however this is essentially my last option. I've spent months exploiting everything possible, there is nothing on the first 10 pages of google that I haven't seen if it's regarding any form of self help to mental health. I've even completely changed my cultural beliefs within so much deep searching (previously being a dead-set atheist and science geek) to a spiritually awoken, open minded believer of many things. \n\nI don't want to talk to a GP, I want to talk to a psychologist or someone of a mental health profession, someone who will take me seriously. I don't want my GP to know about all of my symptoms but I need to get help. How do I talk to my GP to make him see the extent without the details?\n\nP.S Paying for a psychologist is out of the window (to begin with at least). I'm struggling so hard to keep up work and I have no financial support. It's not possible.\n\nTL;DR - Mental health has got worse since failed suicide. Dropped therapy. Sickeningly paranoid about doctors, however have no other option. Am now just in a messy slump and have no one to talk to other than you guys.

I&amp;#39;ve been NEET, living with my mom for 4 years. I feel stuck. So much has happened to me over this period. I&amp;#39;ve had run-ins with the police. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for a stretch of time. My ex-girlfriend almost strangled me to death. I burned all my bridges. And now, I&amp;#39;m dealing with this fucking disease. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been fighting this madness inside my head since March 2016. I call it the &amp;quot;alignment problem&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve had signs of it all my life, but March 2016 was a particularly stressful time for me, and that&amp;#39;s when it spiraled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For context, I&amp;#39;ve always felt that I&amp;#39;m not fully immersed in the present moment, like there&amp;#39;s something I need to finish before I can truly enjoy and experience &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;. Imagine you want to unwind, and relax, but you have to finish a work assignment, or a report, and so there&amp;#39;s a hanging presence of unfinished business constantly following you around until you finish. That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve felt like all my life, like I&amp;#39;m not truly relaxed, because I have something I need to &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thing I need to &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; has destroyed me. I describe it as an optimization process, or an alignment process. It feels like I have to straighten out my very core, and once I do, I&amp;#39;ll be at the forefront of reality, able to live freely and relax without feeling the presence of unfinished business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In March 2016, when I felt the urge to straighten myself out, I decided for the first time that I&amp;#39;d start work on this unfinished business and align myself as such. When I refer to &amp;quot;alignment&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m often using the term in a very literal sense. Picture a dark, cavernous space, with a bubble inside it, directly located in the center. That bubble was me. I felt the urge to be fully aligned and symmetrical, in a very literal, visual sense, and if I wasn&amp;#39;t, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to move forward with my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d often lay down in bed and visualize myself in this dark, cavernous space for hours. I needed to remember it at all times. I needed to be centered at all times. These initial visualizations led to a more &amp;quot;intellectualized&amp;quot; approach, where I would actually try to prove I was &amp;quot;in the center&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it started like this...&amp;quot;in the center&amp;quot;... what does that mean, exactly, and how can I make it true? Eventually, I came to the word &amp;quot;important&amp;quot;. If I want to be truly &amp;quot;centered&amp;quot;, I have to become the most important person in the Universe. Not for any egotistical reason. Purely for the sake of alignment and symmetry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I came up with a list of arbitrary facts about myself and the world, and tried to maneuver them into some &amp;quot;grand truth&amp;quot; about the Universe, so that I could prove my significance and finally become centered. Every part of me knew it was untrue and knew I wasn&amp;#39;t universally significant, but I needed it to be true, and I practically FORCED it to be true. For days and days and weeks and months I forced myself to remember every significant fact about myself to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; that I was worthy of alignment and symmetry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about 3 months of this, my consciousness was fucking rattled, almost to the extent of numerous psychedelic trips. I felt like I was off the planet. Three straight months of forcing untrue drivel into reality by repeating it incessantly to myself. Three straight months of looping thoughts, desperately trying to find my center. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I developed derealization. My moods became incredibly erratic. Paranoia set in. I was no longer on planet Earth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this period, I realized I would not be able to align myself this way, by forcing absurd truths into existence. I figured, hey, if I want to center myself, I have to center myself using facts. And so I did. I spent another four months trying to unravel the true nature of reality. I thought if I could understand the world around me, as well as morality, I&amp;#39;d finally be aligned and have strong justification for my actions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four months went by. Another long stretch of time, trying to accomplish the impossible. Trying to answer every question known to man so that I have symmetry in my life. After this, I no longer had anything to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot;. I was just lost. The alignment problem began to seep into every facet of my life, whether it be fitness, speaking with family and friends, organizing my home, literally everything became an issue of symmetry and balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything needed to be &amp;quot;just right&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was only in the summer of this year that I started to realize... Maybe there&amp;#39;s no solution here. Maybe I&amp;#39;m too far gone. At this point, I&amp;#39;d developed severe delusions, probably stemming from all the months of obsessive thoughts and ruminations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I finally saw a psychiatrist, about a month ago. I&amp;#39;m apparently schizophrenic, which makes sense, but I think there&amp;#39;s more to it than that. She prescribed me Risperdal, which I haven&amp;#39;t really taken. I&amp;#39;m in a state of chaos right now. It&amp;#39;s been nearly two years of repeating thoughts. Fucking &amp;quot;alignment&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me thinks I shouldn&amp;#39;t take medication, because if I force myself not to, my mind might accelerate into &amp;quot;overdrive&amp;quot; mode and automatically revert back to normal. I&amp;#39;m desperately hoping for this. I just want to go back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I wrote this post, frankly, but I&amp;#39;m now thinking of killing my ex-girlfriend. I&amp;#39;ve had thoughts like this before but this time it&amp;#39;s real. I want to kill her, film it, and became famous for it. And then maybe I&amp;#39;ll kill myself. I can&amp;#39;t take these repeating thoughts anymore. I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore. Just can&amp;#39;t do it. I want it to end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT SAID... I think this would all go away if I could just solve this fucking alignment problem. Maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t have to end like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess what I want to ask is... does this sound like OCD to you? Would antipsychotics even help my situation? Am I so far gone it&amp;#39;s not even worth it anymore? I&amp;#39;ve been awake nearly 36 hours and I&amp;#39;m struggling to see the point of living anymore. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

I have trouble working since 2 years but when I do work and earn a little money he is very negative about my work. \nHow do I assert my hurt and rejected feelings and change the conversation? \n\nYes I do struggle with hygiene and do my best, I also struggle with work and do my best. Of course I have bad spells, but in general I make progress over the months. I think this is pretty normal for a young person who has been living with undiagnosed mental illness for years on end. I am getting diagnosis now \n\ntl, dr: I have been living with undiagnosed mental illness for years, hygiene and work not the best.

So my older brother is diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia twenty years ago. He has been on clozapine, which has overwhelmingly worked, despite occasional relapses. Our mother said he was unbearable before being on the clozapine and would constantly be kicked out of placements. The last placement he was in, he walked away from and several miles to our house to tell our mother one of the workers pulled a knife on him. So my mom had started caring for him. This was about ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So about once every couple years or longer, my brother would have a relapse where he would start obsessing over something odd, like the weather or Obama and it was difficult to understand exactly what his concern was. I would sit down with him and talk to him, but he was very hard to understand specifically when he was obsessing about something that upset him. After a few days or a week of this, eventually it would culminate in a large incident where the police would be called. I witnessed this happen when he banged his head on a vacuum and told the police someone else in the home had attacked him. This was NOT typical for his personality. He would go to the psychiatric hospital for a few days and come back perfectly normal and fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another one of these incidents happened about a month ago where he started obsessing over something, making word soup, and he claimed to have thrown out his meds, which I guess weren&amp;#39;t really his meds. However, the hospital sent him home without his clozapine and gave him depakote and abilify instead. For ages, my brother has insisted he doesn&amp;#39;t have schizophrenia and said he&amp;#39;d been occasionally finding ways to not take his meds for a week at a time. He also claimed the hospital doesn&amp;#39;t think he has schizophrenia and that is why they won&amp;#39;t give him clozapine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for the past month, it has been a living hell. Relapses and the police arriving have gone from being a once in two years or longer event to happening at least four times in the past month. He attempted suicide twice and then has been downplaying that and everything else. He&amp;#39;s been sleeping two hours at the most every single night. He hasn&amp;#39;t been eating. He&amp;#39;s been pounding on the walls and claiming he&amp;#39;s not. He&amp;#39;s been pacing the house. He&amp;#39;s been making everyone anxious and on edge. Yelling and making accusations constantly. Constantly picking fights and telling me that another relative is out to get him, when I know that relative isn&amp;#39;t. He&amp;#39;s been telling me his contacts online who work for Google or the government are telling him this and that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has been out of control, and things are getting really scary. The hospital seemingly isn&amp;#39;t taking this seriously and I have no idea what to do. I live a few states away, but my family is dealing with this every single day.

I would sit down with him and talk to him, but he was very hard to understand specifically when he was obsessing about something that upset him. After a few days or a week of this, eventually it would culminate in a large incident where the police would be called. I witnessed this happen when he banged his head on a vacuum and told the police someone else in the home had attacked him. This was NOT typical for his personality. He would go to the psychiatric hospital for a few days and come back perfectly normal and fine.\n\nAnother one of these incidents happened about a month ago where he started obsessing over something, making word soup, and he claimed to have thrown out his meds, which I guess weren't really his meds. However, the hospital sent him home without his clozapine and gave him depakote and abilify instead. For ages, my brother has insisted he doesn't have schizophrenia and said he'd been occasionally finding ways to not take his meds for a week at a time. He also claimed the hospital doesn't think he has schizophrenia and that is why they won't give him clozapine.\n\nSo for the past month, it has been a living hell. Relapses and the police arriving have gone from being a once in two years or longer event to happening at least four times in the past month. He attempted suicide twice and then has been downplaying that and everything else. He's been sleeping two hours at the most every single night. He hasn't been eating. He's been pounding on the walls and claiming he's not. He's been pacing the house. He's been making everyone anxious and on edge. Yelling and making accusations constantly. Constantly picking fights and telling me that another relative is out to get him, when I know that relative isn't. He's been telling me his contacts online who work for Google or the government are telling him this and that.\n\nThis has been out of control, and things are getting really scary. The hospital seemingly isn't taking this seriously and I have no idea what to do. I live a few states away, but my family is dealing with this every single day.

In fact, the other day she smirked as she saw this happen. It made me feel completely powerless, and like so many times in my life where I felt like a nasty girl was driving how I felt.

There were no crowds. I was proud of myself for trying my best for not worrying what the others at work might think of me, and oh, he wasn\u2019t there. I though maybe this all really was a diplacement of all my other on-the-job anxieties onto him, and I would be fine from now on. But the next day when it was a little crowded, but later on not and no reason for me to be anxious, he was there and the same thing happened.

I have a genuinely good life, a stable family, an amazing boyfriend, I go to high school, I play sports, and have friends. Though some of these friends just don&amp;#39;t click with me, ever since i&amp;#39;ve been young ive had a hard time finding genuine people in my life. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to say that I feel &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; than them, it&amp;#39;s just always the girls who are all about drama, gossip, and spreading shit are not people who I wanna hang out with, ya know? I really only feel like I have one genuine person in my life, which is my boyfriend. He&amp;#39;s super super great, we get along so well, we&amp;#39;ve been together some time now and no arguments or anything. He relates to me, and how I am as a person and he also relates to the things that I like, which is super great. He&amp;#39;s also a senior, and each and everyday (being a sophmore) knowing that one day he&amp;#39;ll go away terrifies me. And that&amp;#39;s when the thoughts of having no one to hang out with next year is awful. I have the best time with my boyfriend, and when i&amp;#39;m with his friends, they&amp;#39;re all just good people with good intentions, that want to just sit back relax and chill and have a good time. These girls that I call my friends, are anything but this. I&amp;#39;m not saying they are horrible people by any means, but anytime I hangout with any of them I just don&amp;#39;t enjoy myself, and being around them. Many people see me as a pretty mature person, and maybe this is why? Maybe because I just can&amp;#39;t stand the stupid girl shit? To sum all that up, I really feel like I only have one genuine person in my life (my boyfriend), and I just haven&amp;#39;t found a single other person that I relate to or someone that i&amp;#39;d actually enjoy hanging out with other than my bf. It&amp;#39;s not like I hate people, I have many friends and such, and i&amp;#39;ve tried hanging out with so many people, and most of those people I just don&amp;#39;t find myself having a good time with them. And I see other people who constantly get texts from other people all the time, getting snapchats, and people asking to hang out, and I guess I don&amp;#39;t really have that. I go to a pretty small school so pretty much everybody knows everybody. And tbh I feel like i&amp;#39;ve ran out of options of people to hang out with, and as soon as my bf goes away after he graduates, then what?? Which brings me to the fact that I absolutely hate being alone, I was just gone on a trip with my boyfriend for about a week, and as soon as I came home after the trip, I instantly dreaded being alone, by myself. It&amp;#39;s like as soon as I am away from people that I enjoy, and come home I just have such a horrible time. Like it&amp;#39;s not even like something&amp;#39;s wrong at my house or with my family, it just puts me in a depressive mood. I don&amp;#39;t mean to use to word &amp;quot;depressive&amp;quot; as if i&amp;#39;m depressed, but really just puts me in a really low mood, if that makes sense? And then the thing that has been really hard for me, it&amp;#39;s just getting up, getting ready, going to school, coming back home, doing homework, then waking up and doing it every single fucking day. School puts me in such a shitty mood, and it&amp;#39;s just knowing that this is all my life is for the next what? 6 years? It&amp;#39;s awful. Like wow this is my life, sick. Then the weekend comes around and everything seems to be back to normal, and i&amp;#39;m happy. But as soon as Sunday creeps up, the dread of another week of school comes. I just feel like my life isn&amp;#39;t being fulfilled as it should be. Yes if your a teenager this is your life, and I totally get that. But I don&amp;#39;t understand how people are smiling and all happy at school. It&amp;#39;s literally the same thing day, after day, after day. I guess you could say that i&amp;#39;m the type of person who always wants to be doing something that I enjoy. And as the school year keep going by, the worse it gets. Depression and anxiety runs through my family, and I kinda feel like as if i&amp;#39;m starting to be effected too. I&amp;#39;ve noticed a change in my thoughts, and how I perceive life. Some days I&amp;#39;ll wake up with a huge wave of anxiety, like my heart beats fast, I breath hard, and my thoughts are going a mile a minute. And some days, i&amp;#39;ll wake up and barely have enough energy to even get up. It&amp;#39;s not everyday that this happens, but it&amp;#39;s getting to a point where I dread it happening. And some days I just literally feel like shit, like everything sucks, and nothing is good, and those are the days that are the worst. Lately i&amp;#39;ve been finding myself going to bed pretty early (like 7:30) just because I want to go to bed, and I want to stop feeling the way I do, and even though having a descent amount of sleep I still find myself so exhausted throughout the next day. I used to be able to come home, and be happy and be content with netflix, youtube, or just texting people. And now it&amp;#39;s like I can&amp;#39;t even do that, it&amp;#39;s like i&amp;#39;m so bored with my life that i&amp;#39;ll just go to bed. Last year it was pretty bad, my ex bf was a douche bag, I had friends but I chose to eat alone, and a lot of the days last year I was just quite. My boyfriend has made my life so much better this year, and I cherish every single second i&amp;#39;m with him. But still I have days that absolutely suck, I tend to hide it because I hate being asked if i&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; or whatever, and being in that mood puts other people&amp;#39;s moods down too. I feel like I haven&amp;#39;t accomplished anything in life, like literally nothing and that feeling sucks so bad. I believe every person on the planet was put on here for a reason, and I guess maybe I just haven&amp;#39;t found that reason yet? I&amp;#39;ve also noticed myself, getting up in the morning having an appetite, but realizing no food sounds good to me, and finding myself hours into the day without eating and not even having an appetite. Like wtf?? I eat, i&amp;#39;m not saying I don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve just noticed my appetite has kinda gone to shit. This is not all the time that this happens, but i&amp;#39;m definitely starting to notice it. The other super weird thing that i&amp;#39;ve noticed, is I used to be able to listen to music all day long and enjoy it soo much. Like music is such a big part of my life (or it was) and now I find myself not enjoying it like I used to. It&amp;#39;s super weird, and honestly kinda sucks. I treat people so nicely, and then they fuck me over and i&amp;#39;ll continue to treat them nicely. Like why tf would you continue to associate yourself with someone who just fucked you over?? I&amp;#39;m getting better at this in fact, cause i&amp;#39;ve learned to not let people walk all over you. I just wish I had more people that I connected with like I do with my boyfriend. I&amp;#39;m sort of a  negative person, and if I do something wrong or not good enough (especially for sports) im real hard on myself. It&amp;#39;s just how I am I guess. I have a very negative outlook on life, i&amp;#39;ll over think things and just immediately think the worst it going to happen. I&amp;#39;m not sure what&amp;#39;s wrong with me, or if this is just a normal thing and I need to find a way to cope, but if anyone could give me their thoughts on this it would be great appreciated.

I am a 23 year old male in his final year of university. I had an episode of non-organic psychosis about a year ago which meant I had to suspend my final year until the following autumn. During this episode I experienced grandiose delusions, paranoia, suicidal ideation and other unpleasant symptoms. To placate my parents I agreed to see a mental health professional and over the course of a month or two began to see my condition for what it was, an affliction and not reality. It was during this process as I began to question my reality and the beliefs I had about the world that I started to notice how different I am from other people. As I focused on myself and reflected critically on my interactions with others it became increasingly obvious that I was different from almost everyone I knew. I understand this sounds suspicious given the psychosis and the delusions I&amp;#39;d experienced, (believing I was a semi-god at one point), but I&amp;#39;ve been symptomless regarding the psychosis for at least half a year while I&amp;#39;ve continued to observe differences this whole time. I have been on medication for the psychosis for about half a year also. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will try and explain the sort of thing I&amp;#39;m talking about. The most obvious and frequent difference I observe concerns social interactions. It seems as though I interact with people entirely differently from how everyone else interacts with each other. Conversation does not come easy for me and I generally find speaking difficult. I marvel at how people are able to continue speaking coherently for 10 or more seconds, minutes even. Yet I find I (usually) can only give brief responses or one word answers. When people ask me questions I simply don&amp;#39;t have anything to say, I typically give a very brief response and then ask them a question because I simply cannot contribute myself. This results in very one-sided conversations that basically peter out if the other person gets tired of talking because I have almost nothing to say myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would add that I rarely find things funny. I&amp;#39;m left in awe of people who are always chuckling at things or laughing at other people&amp;#39;s jokes, just as I am in awe of their ability to actually have conversations. Often when in a group scenario I will say nothing at all and sit or stand silently until I leave or until the activity is complete. As such I am always a peripheral member of any group. Not being able to talk to people makes building relationships extremely difficult. That is not to say that I don&amp;#39;t say anything ever. I can engage in class in the rare instance I have something to say, I can ask friends questions for a limited amount of time or offer small contributions from my experiences but they always feel unnatural. The thing is I don&amp;#39;t have a favourite subject, situation, or person that I can fall back on and talk about happily. I don&amp;#39;t open up after a couple of drinks. I am always basically at a loss for what to say. Which is one of the reasons I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m autistic/aspergers. I did briefly consider the possibility but having watched videos of people with aspergers or talking about aspergers it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to fit my &amp;#39;nothing to say&amp;#39; model. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did some work with a psychologist who suggested I&amp;#39;m an introvert.

My mom's dad is a very successful man, he's traveled the world, been the CEO of multiple companies in Canada, and (not to sound prude) is pretty rich. My mom and dad divorced right after I was born. My mom moved in with her parents in a verg wealthy neighborhood, and I've lived here my entire life. My mom and grandparents are very kind people, but have sheltered me my entire life. They've done everything for me, and I mean literally everything. They cook meals everyday for me, they clean for me, do my laundry, etc. I am very spoiled, but very lucky.\n\nThe reason I gave this lengthy backstory is because I believe I rely on my family, my mother especially, for way too much. I'm going to college soon and I'm scared that it's going to be a (for lack of a better term) culture shock. I'm afraid I won't know how to do anything, I'll be completely lost and expect everything to be done for when it isn't. I know I'm stuck-up. I know that I'm entitled. And I hate it, I absolutely hate it. I hate relying on people to things for me, but I don't know how else to act. I hope someone on this subreddit can help me out. \n\nThank you,\nExzj", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7fhukt", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I need some advice.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7fhukt", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7fhukt/i_need_some_advice/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1511671425.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7fhukt/i_need_some_advice/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Exzj", "created_utc": 1511642625.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a mental hospital for adolescents and am under section 3 I have been told that I have strong signs of psychosis and have been referred to an EIP team but I can&amp;#39;t understand it I feel the best I have ever felt.

Ever since a few years ago, I have had fantasies about bad things happening to me. Things like pets dying, my parents or little brother being hurt, being abused, however the one that pops up most with me is rape. I have read about rape fantasies, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s as innocent as that; I honestly, truly want it to happen to me. It&amp;#39;s funny that I want these things to happen to me because real people truly suffer from them and would love to have a privileged life such as mine. I also find it funny that I fantasize being abused by a family member or spouse since not too long ago, I lived with my biological father, who was a very narcissistic, emotionally abusive man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I know that if any of these things actually happened to me, I would not be happy. That would be the logical (as logical as a young teen girl can get, that is) side of my brain talking. And I also have a strange relationship with self harm and suicide, often contemplating the results of said actions/behaviors, but I would never go through with these thoughts because that would be a horribly selfish and inconsiderate thing to do to my loved ones.

Ever since a few years ago, I have had fantasies about bad things happening to me. Things like pets dying, my parents or little brother being hurt, being abused, however the one that pops up most with me is rape. I have read about rape fantasies, but I don't think it's as innocent as that; I honestly, truly want it to happen to me. It's funny that I want these things to happen to me because real people truly suffer from them and would love to have a privileged life such as mine. I also find it funny that I fantasize being abused by a family member or spouse since not too long ago, I lived with my biological father, who was a very narcissistic, emotionally abusive man. \n\nOf course, I know that if any of these things actually happened to me, I would not be happy. That would be the logical (as logical as a young teen girl can get, that is) side of my brain talking. And I also have a strange relationship with self harm and suicide, often contemplating the results of said actions/behaviors, but I would never go through with these thoughts because that would be a horribly selfish and inconsiderate thing to do to my loved ones. So basically, I don't believe I or my family is palaced in any innate danger from these fantasies. \n\nI think it most likely stems from extreme attention seeking behavior, which is probably the most destructive thing about it because if there is anything that I hate about myself, it's that I desperately need attention, recognition, and validation.

So I\u2019ll give a brief story here. My parents were getting divorced a few months ago after my dad cheated on my mom a few years ago. This was back in the summer now, when they were getting divorced. They split up but it was never official. They then fixed things (for a while) I was fine during this time, but I was feeling pretty down. I went to smoking during the first \u201cdivorce\u201d, thought I\u2019d give it a try see why people do it, yknow. I found it kinda made me feel almost happy I guess. Don\u2019t know how to explain it. It kinda made it easier to go through the troubles. I was addicted to nicotine and it was hard to go a day without it. Then when my parents got back together I was feeling a lil bit better and didn\u2019t need the smokes. I quit instantly, even though I was addicted. I just didn\u2019t need it anymore. And now they are going through with the divorce. It makes it harder now cause I thought everything would be fine and then it all comes crashing down. I feel sad a lot of the time and every little thing that probably shouldn\u2019t make me sad and probably isn\u2019t really a big deal and I know this, but it still makes me sad. I just don\u2019t know why. This is gonna sound probably hilarious cause it makes me sad idk why but even when it makes me sad I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to admit it. My girlfriend was going to get her belly button pierced in two weeks and I was going to go with her when she got it done, we had it all planned. Then she changed dates to today and got it done today. I worked today and she still really wanted me to go. I couldn\u2019t miss work though, and she kept telling me to miss work to go with her. I wanted to so fucking bad I don\u2019t know why it meant something to me cause it\u2019s just a piercing. She got it done anyway, I told her if she wanted me to go with her she\u2019d have to go when we originally planned it. But she went and got it done. After that I don\u2019t know what I felt but I was sad and it\u2019s like almost funny sounding to me that i was sad and still am about it. I feel like there\u2019s something wrong with me cause little things like this make me sad. Shit I feel like I\u2019m repeating myself over and over. I hope somebody can just lemme know if they\u2019re going through the same thing and what I can do to stop myself from feeling this way over little things like this. It hurts and it\u2019s getting worse the more it happens and I don\u2019t know what to do. Thanks if anybody can help. I\u2019d appreciate it.

It&amp;#39;s a short drive south of Portland. I live on the outskirts of where it sits somewhere between suburban and rural housing. I have neighbors, but they&amp;#39;re not exactly &amp;quot;next door&amp;quot;. I was 19 at the time of this story. I used to have a problem with sleep. I don&amp;#39;t know what it was, but I&amp;#39;d get mentally crippling anxiety and I&amp;#39;d go for a walk to calm my mind. I live on a single lane road that follows a stream through the woods so, needless to say, the scenery mixed with the quiet trickle was always quite calming. It was summertime and I remember it to be a particularly rough night for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember telling my dad that I was going for a walk as I hurriedly slipped on my shoes and hustled out. I still remember the look on his face as I tried to escape in the midst of my own mental panic. He looked worried about me. My late night walks had gained frequency at the time and I knew it was starting to concern him. Nevertheless, I shut the door behind me and proceeded into the dark. I remember it being clear skies but I don&amp;#39;t remember stars. The moon must have been full as well because I could see the road without light but I don&amp;#39;t remember seeing the moon itself that night either.\nI remember I just started walking. Talking to myself about everything that had my anxiety spiked. I&amp;#39;m sure I looked insane, rambling to myself, but sometimes it helped me process the issues by just talking it out. From my home to the main road is about a mile. I was about 2/3 of the way to the main road when I heard something rustle in the bushes to my right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;#39;t uncommon. I&amp;#39;d jumped deer, raccoons, a bobcat, and even a few coyotes on my walks, but I still liked to know what was around.\nI pulled out my phone and flicked on the light. For context, there&amp;#39;s a hill to my right that goes up. This is where I heard the noise. To my left is a 10 foot drop into the creek. I shined my light into the bushes to see what I was dealing with. Usually these things either freeze or scamper off in my experience which helps me know what it is. Nothing. There was nothing there. I don&amp;#39;t know what set me off but my hair started to stick up. I felt scared. I tensed and I realized that the creek should be audible as the water ran over the rocks but I couldn&amp;#39;t hear it like I normally could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something clearly was wrong. I heard a branch snap in the bushes again. I moved my light back and just saw lights looking back. Two small red lights, like eyes. I moved my light to see if it was a reflection off something. It wasn&amp;#39;t. Instead it started to get closer. I ran. I fucking RAN. I ran in near silence. I don&amp;#39;t know if I screamed. I know it didn&amp;#39;t matter. I couldn&amp;#39;t hear my own shoes hitting the road. I couldn&amp;#39;t hear my own breathing or my heartbeat pounding in my ears as I ran faster than I ever had. All I heard was what sounded like an animal with human bare feet chasing me.\nI looked back and saw that it had a head bearing resemblance to a dog but it wasn&amp;#39;t like a normal dog since it was running on two feet. I don&amp;#39;t know what primal survival instinct kicked in but something told me I needed to find light. Not the light on my phone that could be squashed but something bigger. The first place I went for was home. There&amp;#39;s a large barn light out front of my family&amp;#39;s house. It&amp;#39;s bright and covers the whole driveway. I ran like hell was on my heels because for all I knew, it was. I just remember hearing it getting closer as I ran. It was running me down but I feel like it was toying with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s footstep pattern didn&amp;#39;t sound like an all out sprint. More like a light gallop. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I rounded the last corner and the light became visible that it all of a sudden picked up pace and started to close the distance. I ran full sprint to the light pole as it gained. I heard it&amp;#39;s furious steps come to an abrupt stop, but I didn&amp;#39;t turn back.\nI tackled the tar covered wooden light post as best as any 19 year old kid can. I stayed there clutching that disgusting, sticky post, waiting for the end. Waiting for this thing to tear me apart. It never did. I sat there for an hour in the silence until my phone rang. I had three messages and two prior calls. All from my dad asking where I was. I lied and said I fell asleep in a field up the road. I realized I could hear the world again and assumed that meant it had left. I ran inside the house and locked the doors. To this day, I don&amp;#39;t walk alone on my road. Day or night. I know what you&amp;#39;re probably thinking, &amp;quot;it was probably just your mind playing tricks&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;it was probably just an animal&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen animals. I know what animals are near my home. This was nothing that has ever lived here. This story made me think back to some of the other things I&amp;#39;d seen and experienced out here. Things I couldn&amp;#39;t explain.\nA fully grown deer, burned from the inside out for instance. The only way you&amp;#39;d have known is from the single area in the ribs that had burnt through the perfectly preserved flesh and bone. Moments where I&amp;#39;d find myself seeming to slip through time. My alarm would go off at 6AM and I&amp;#39;d wait outside for my ride for three hours just to come back in and see it was only just turned to 5AM. Shadow Figures by the side of the road. A couple unexplained deaths. The list goes on. I&amp;#39;m telling you, something strange and terrifying is out here. Some nights I wonder, do my doors and windows really keep whatever it is out, or is it still just toying with me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: if anyone has any ideas what the fuck I&amp;#39;m dealing with, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "The following is a story that 100% truthfully happened to me about two years ago.

For those who have not I will do my best to Tl;dr. Again, as with all my posts it is a way for me to help me recover, understand myself a little bit more and finally talk about these things in the open and hopefully help others to open up. Any questions, as always please don\u2019t hesitate to ask \ud83d\ude0a One good thing, this one does have a lighter tone, even though the topic is a dark one and shorter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try my best to remember how I felt exactly, the moment when I leaped from the arm chair in my bedroom. I remember uncontrollably crying, not a single drop of fear but a mass mixture of emotions. Pathetic, being completely inadequate as I was told by so many other students at my high school. I could do nothing right, I was pathetic in my own mind. A burden on all those around me, just getting in the way with my constant unhappiness. And the one that I will always remember, loneliness. I had nothing, not a single friend, no goals, no wants, needs or anything to keep me going. I felt disconnected from everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in the darkest of places, alone, vulnerable with no way out other than suicide to kill the pain. That was my \u201crational\u201d thinking at the time. The drop was not far enough to break my neck but greatly tighten the noose, made from my bed sheet, enough to stop me breathing and the blood flow to my head. I remember feeling/thinking like a burden would be lifted from this world if I was not part of it. I had no belonging. Everything began to fade to black I think I felt happy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well as you can tell I am sitting typing these words away so all is well, I think haha. When I tell people about it, which I rarely do, I talk about the funny irony in it all (as I do now think its rather amusing in a morbid way) in that the reason I survived was because the light fitting could not hold my weight, one of the many reasons I was bullied. My dad found me and managed to bring me around without the need to paramedics. What I will say was I did not feel pathetic for failing, I was happy to be alive. Call it what you will but I am happy to have lived through it as my life has been one hell of a journey so far and long may it continue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never spoken with my dad about that day, what he felt, what must have gone through his mind finding his so lying with a bed sheet tied around his neck. One day I will pluck the courage to ask, for now I shall wonder. Looking back, I was not a danger to myself after the incident but to others I can see why they would think the opposite, which surprises me that I was never admitted to hospital but instead treatment began at home and then at school. Rather modern approach I like to think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look back in amazement and how rational that thought was. It made sense, it was the completely right choice to make and the only option I had. Scary to think how easy it was, now I can relate, somewhat to others. Everything in place, centre stage and ready for the curtain to descend. I sometimes wonder if it was just the bullying that caused it or something more, the emotional or sexual abuse (this one is for another post) I encountered through my younger years, all building up to a climax, the bullying being that last push. I did write a note, but in all honesty, I don\u2019t really care what is in it as deep down I know it was just the writings a hurt, vulnerable and unhappy young man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it were not for that light fitting breaking, I would not be here today knowing I have touched so many people, seen and experienced so many wonderful things. I must admit I would not change this part of my life, it is a part of who I am, a unique additional chapter in my book of life. As my wonderful and amazing other half always says \u201ca plot twist\u201d. I have also been exceptionally lucky to have had support back then, but also some kind of growth that allowed me to overcome a lot of social issues, make friends and improve the strength of my mental self. I often wonder then, what would the world be like if I had completed suicide? A question I will never know the answer too, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really struggled to write this post not only because I am over this part of my life (it is still part of who I am today but has no emotional impact), but what to say for those who are reading and possibly at their worst, feeling like suicide is the rational choice. What can you take from this that may make you rethink? I honestly don\u2019t know. Putting aside my course/professionalism I would want to fucking jump through your monitor, hug you and say \u201cLet\u2019s talk, tell me what has caused you to feel this way?\u201d. I would want you to tell me everything, discuss it all. Allow you to be vulnerable and see that it\u2019s ok. Know that someone is their for you because I know how alone you can feel.

For those who have not I will do my best to Tl;dr. Again, as with all my posts it is a way for me to help me recover, understand myself a little bit more and finally talk about these things in the open and hopefully help others to open up. Any questions, as always please don\u2019t hesitate to ask \ud83d\ude0a One good thing, this one does have a lighter tone, even though the topic is a dark one and shorter.*\n\nI try my best to remember how I felt exactly, the moment when I leaped from the arm chair in my bedroom. I remember uncontrollably crying, not a single drop of fear but a mass mixture of emotions. Pathetic, being completely inadequate as I was told by so many other students at my high school. I could do nothing right, I was pathetic in my own mind. A burden on all those around me, just getting in the way with my constant unhappiness. And the one that I will always remember, loneliness. I had nothing, not a single friend, no goals, no wants, needs or anything to keep me going. I felt disconnected from everything.\n\nI was in the darkest of places, alone, vulnerable with no way out other than suicide to kill the pain. That was my \u201crational\u201d thinking at the time. The drop was not far enough to break my neck but greatly tighten the noose, made from my bed sheet, enough to stop me breathing and the blood flow to my head. I remember feeling/thinking like a burden would be lifted from this world if I was not part of it. I had no belonging. Everything began to fade to black I think I felt happy. \n\nWell as you can tell I am sitting typing these words away so all is well, I think haha. When I tell people about it, which I rarely do, I talk about the funny irony in it all (as I do now think its rather amusing in a morbid way) in that the reason I survived was because the light fitting could not hold my weight, one of the many reasons I was bullied. My dad found me and managed to bring me around without the need to paramedics. What I will say was I did not feel pathetic for failing, I was happy to be alive. Call it what you will but I am happy to have lived through it as my life has been one hell of a journey so far and long may it continue. \n\nI have never spoken with my dad about that day, what he felt, what must have gone through his mind finding his so lying with a bed sheet tied around his neck. One day I will pluck the courage to ask, for now I shall wonder. Looking back, I was not a danger to myself after the incident but to others I can see why they would think the opposite, which surprises me that I was never admitted to hospital but instead treatment began at home and then at school. Rather modern approach I like to think.\n\nI look back in amazement and how rational that thought was. It made sense, it was the completely right choice to make and the only option I had. Scary to think how easy it was, now I can relate, somewhat to others. Everything in place, centre stage and ready for the curtain to descend. I sometimes wonder if it was just the bullying that caused it or something more, the emotional or sexual abuse (this one is for another post) I encountered through my younger years, all building up to a climax, the bullying being that last push. I did write a note, but in all honesty, I don\u2019t really care what is in it as deep down I know it was just the writings a hurt, vulnerable and unhappy young man. \n\nIf it were not for that light fitting breaking, I would not be here today knowing I have touched so many people, seen and experienced so many wonderful things. I must admit I would not change this part of my life, it is a part of who I am, a unique additional chapter in my book of life. As my wonderful and amazing other half always says \u201ca plot twist\u201d. I have also been exceptionally lucky to have had support back then, but also some kind of growth that allowed me to overcome a lot of social issues, make friends and improve the strength of my mental self. I often wonder then, what would the world be like if I had completed suicide? A question I will never know the answer too, thankfully.\n\nI really struggled to write this post not only because I am over this part of my life (it is still part of who I am today but has no emotional impact), but what to say for those who are reading and possibly at their worst, feeling like suicide is the rational choice. What can you take from this that may make you rethink? I honestly don\u2019t know. Putting aside my course/professionalism I would want to fucking jump through your monitor, hug you and say \u201cLet\u2019s talk, tell me what has caused you to feel this way?\u201d. I would want you to tell me everything, discuss it all. Allow you to be vulnerable and see that it\u2019s ok. Know that someone is their for you because I know how alone you can feel. That is one thing I will always remember is how alone I was. I never want anyone to feel that way. I really don\u2019t know what to say. Maybe that is the question, What would you say? I guess I don\u2019t have anything to say, I have said all I need to.

Like bad parents, drug addicts, etc, I felt like they were all at fault for their own mistakes, and many accused me of being cold and stoic.

I began to think I had a chance at this &amp;quot;living a normal life&amp;quot; thing that everyone else seemed to be able to do. But about two months ago someone kocked on my door and took me away. I was sent back to the foreign clothes with nothing but the summer dress I was wearing. No papers, no clothes, no phone. I slept at the airport for three days until someone came and picked me up, my three-day &amp;quot;homelessness&amp;quot; was sort of a warning. They put a roof over my head, gave me a mobile phone - for internet purposes - a jumper and a pair of shoes, and about three days ago, a computer.

wasn\u2019t as invested in the sessions as i was. \n\ni think my school offers mental health care (i\u2019m not sure if that includes therapy) but i\u2019m pretty sure they are all just college students and i don\u2019t think i\u2019d feel comfortable talking to them about anything. \n\nso i\u2019m stuck. what would you do in this situation?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null,

I&amp;#39;m from Argentina and here the game industry is barely develop. And in Sweden? The fuckers have tons of game companies that are extremely important! They are one o the countries that make the most games and everybody are kissing their fucking feet! Why?! Why?! They have a much better economy than here, people earn a lot (my gf is from Poland and she told me that in there people earn a lot and I don&amp;#39;t care how high taxes are, your economy is much better than the U.S) and now, to top it all of, extremel important video game companies are all from there, not from the U.S or Japan, but from a freaking country covered in ice! If it was Japan or the U.S I would accept it because they dominate the world basically and I accept that, they are the leaders, but now this fucking country decides to step up and be even better than them in the industry of video games? DON&amp;#39;T YOU GET THERE ARE ALREADY OTHER COUNTRIES THAT CONTROL THIS INDUSTRY!!!! I want to acomplish my dreams of being a great game developer, but so many Sweden developers out there and so many people loving them, I feel like I have much more competition now, I need to compete against another country that has a much better idea of the gaming industry than my country have and I feel like whatever I make won&amp;#39;t be recognized because a lot of Sweden games are extremely different and unique and everyone freaking loves them and appear to be fucking perfect!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that this all sounds like I&amp;#39;m jealous and I must admit that I am. Why Europe needed to succes in the gaming industry? Couldn&amp;#39;t you just fail miserably without any succes? I wanted all european countries to fail, but one has proven to be better than a lot of countries and now people are all interested in them and won&amp;#39;t pay any attention to the gsming industry here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was just U.S and Japan this would be an easy fight.

Well, let me explain you. I'm from Argentina and here the game industry is barely develop. And in Sweden? The fuckers have tons of game companies that are extremely important! They are one o the countries that make the most games and everybody are kissing their fucking feet! Why?! Why?! They have a much better economy than here, people earn a lot (my gf is from Poland and she told me that in there people earn a lot and I don't care how high taxes are, your economy is much better than the U.S) and now, to top it all of, extremel important video game companies are all from there, not from the U.S or Japan, but from a freaking country covered in ice! If it was Japan or the U.S I would accept it because they dominate the world basically and I accept that, they are the leaders, but now this fucking country decides to step up and be even better than them in the industry of video games? DON'T YOU GET THERE ARE ALREADY OTHER COUNTRIES THAT CONTROL THIS INDUSTRY!!!! I want to acomplish my dreams of being a great game developer, but so many Sweden developers out there and so many people loving them, I feel like I have much more competition now, I need to compete against another country that has a much better idea of the gaming industry than my country have and I feel like whatever I make won't be recognized because a lot of Sweden games are extremely different and unique and everyone freaking loves them and appear to be fucking perfect!\n\nI know that this all sounds like I'm jealous and I must admit that I am. Why Europe needed to succes in the gaming industry? Couldn't you just fail miserably without any succes? I wanted all european countries to fail, but one has proven to be better than a lot of countries and now people are all interested in them and won't pay any attention to the gsming industry here.\n\nIf it was just U.S and Japan this would be an easy fight. Only two competitors and thy are easy to surpass. Now, Sweden appears and they are doing everything right and everyone loves them because they are fucking perfect.\n\nI want to be perfect to.\n\nThank you for everything.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7eqamz", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Rage issues and video games", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 6, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7eqamz", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7eqamz/rage_issues_and_video_games/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1511379101.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7eqamz/rage_issues_and_video_games/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "gunofnuts", "created_utc": 1511350301.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been in the mental health system since Fall 2012, initially I was diagnosed with depression and bpd (borderline pd). I spent my time aiming to work at the bpd but the main issue is that I didn&amp;#39;t have most of the core symptoms of the disorder; abandonment issues, anger outbursts, emotional instability and issues with self-identity. What I did have were low mood, incidents of self-harm every few weeks (very minor) and suicidal thoughts. So they medicated me with SSRI&amp;#39;s and I would go into weird psychotic states after a few weeks and on some occasions attempt to end my life. 2012 and 2013 were shitty, no answers with exact diagnosis so I kept working on what I was given; bpd and depression. End of 2013 to end of 2015 I saw a psychiatrist only once in May 2014 after I had been medication and symptom free (except for a huge lack of sleep and an obsession with cleaning binges) for 6 months. She diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and binge eating instead. I decided at the time I was well enough to not have to be in treatment so until October 2015 I did not seek any help. During that time I lost over 35kg (75lbs), I quit smoking, started exercising for a minimum of 4 hours a day and would spend hours on my floor at home meditating and crying tears of happiness, it was like a 4 month mdma high. I crashed in October 2015, sought help, he diagnosed me with bipolar but he was a bit unfriendly so I saw another psych who also diagnosed me with bipolar and treated me until July 2017 so for 18 months about. During that time I was also hospitalised for 8 weeks in London and was diagnosed with bipolar there, by the doctor who had initially diagnosed me with bpd. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from bipolar I have been having issues with a delusion that people are allergic to me so I can&amp;#39;t cope in public when people cough or sneeze as I think it&amp;#39;s an adverse reaction to my body odour. This has been the main drive for my issues with anxiety and moods right now, I would isolate myself and be housebound for months at a time because I don&amp;#39;t want to make people allergic to me. I managed to get a bit of control over it since May this year as my mood has been really good since then. Everything was going well until last week and so I went to the GP and they referred me for an emergency appointment with the local psychiatrist and social worker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their impression is that I have a thought disorder, a delusion about being an allergen for people, but they also want to dismiss the bipolar diagnosis and are reconsidering bpd. I asked them why as I don&amp;#39;t believe I meet the criteria for it at all, I also worked with a bpd specialist last year because I thought I may have had features of it, he reviewed me for about 10-15 sessions and then dismissed the idea of it but brought up possible bipolar again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways so yesterday at the appointment the psychiatrist and social worker were really trying to dispute bipolar, they kept insisting on me giving examples of manic episodes I had and but kept bringing up bpd. My main issue currently is that I have this delusion and it is what is driving ALL of my symptoms of low mood, social isolation and anxiety. The only symptom I currently have of bpd is suicidal thoughts, I used to self-harm which I think is what drove the initial diagnosis but I have not done so since 2013. So now I&amp;#39;m confused with my treatment plan, they&amp;#39;re saying I don&amp;#39;t have bipolar even though that&amp;#39;s been my diagnosis for almost 4 years now and I&amp;#39;ve always responded well to treatment for it but they&amp;#39;re insisting on it being bpd, which I feel could have been the case in 2012-2013 but isn&amp;#39;t anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a bit lost with what to do, I&amp;#39;m worried that as in bpd they don&amp;#39;t recognise psychotic symptoms as being true psychosis but instead call it quasi-psychosis I&amp;#39;m worried they will dismiss my psychotic symptoms which are currently the driving force in my mental ill health. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My thought is currently that I may have symptoms of bipolar, especially having manic and psychotic episodes as a result of monotherapy of an antidepressant but they&amp;#39;re making me question if I have the full blown disorder. Is it possible to have some of the key experiences and symptoms of a disorder like the manic and depressive episodes but not actually have it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the ramble, it&amp;#39;s just I&amp;#39;m completely baffled with what to do now, I have no more diagnosis, the possibility of a diagnosis which I don&amp;#39;t feel fits at all being put down in my file and there is currently no treatment plan regarding medication, therapy, or anything else.

I had given her this bracelet I had gotten from China Town in San francisco. There was broken glass and the beads from that bracelet peppered all over the street. After that I really began to shut down. I know it was just a freak accident but my brain always tells me that it&amp;#39;s all my fault. I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to be in San Diego that day.

And I really feel like a simple choice I made tore a whole family apart. I know people say it&amp;#39;s stupid to feel that way because I wasn&amp;#39;t the one who killed her. But it just kills me that a simple choice that was very insignificant in my life helped lead to the ending of someone else&amp;#39;s.

It seems like when my depression took a seat, this anxiety creeped up to say hello. For example, a couple weeks ago in class we were taking a test that I had studied really hard for. As we were taking it, all I could hear were noises. The girl stepping on her flip flop in front of me, the loudness of someone&amp;#39;s pencil as they were writing, too much coughing. I know these things are agitating to anyone, but it feels like my sensitivity to this background noise(?) is almost on the verge on giving me a panic attack. I find myself fidgeting and my heart beats fast but also feels heavy and I get so much adrenaline (I think why fidget with my hands). Needless to say, I failed my test. I couldn&amp;#39;t concentrate because all I could hear was noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is just the one example of many. This comes when I know things are supposed to be quiet. I can&amp;#39;t study at home because I don&amp;#39;t want my parents to feel like they have to leave the entire house. I can&amp;#39;t listen to music and look at my work. Sound and my presence feel like they have to be separated. When I go to bed I can&amp;#39;t have the fan on, or my computer in the background, or any excess lights. It has to be completely silent. This is something that is honestly disrupting my every day life and over time it keeps getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about going to the doctor but then I just felt like they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand.

I guess I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this? Sometimes after I realize I deal with it so long I just have a complete mental breakdown and it&amp;#39;s so strange. My thought was that it was some sort of side effect from being in such a bad mental state for so long that my body is in a frenzy or something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Side note, I really want to invest in noise cancelling headphones.

I\u2019ll think back to problems I may of had with someone in the past and worry that they may have something against me still (even if we\u2019d resolved the problem there and then.) \nIt\u2019s like once I think about something I get this sinking feeling in my stomach and then the overthinking begins. I\u2019ll then spend every second of every day thinking and worrying myself into a mess. For instance if I had a problem with someone in the past I\u2019ll then spend every second of every day convincing myself that this person has a problem with me and is out to get me for example, even when absolutely nothing has been said or done and the situation has been resolved before. You just know this person wouldn\u2019t have thought about this once and here I am panicking about it in even many cases years later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is 100% interfering with my everyday life. I feel like I just want to be on my own when I have these thoughts but that\u2019s probably the worst thing for me to be honest.

Just hanging out with my female cousin gave me a lot of confidence towards other girls.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was never under any delusions though, she was a pretty toxic person and I&amp;#39;m sure half the reason we hung out so much was because I had money to do things and she didn&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This became WAAAAY too obvious one night when I had mentioned on FB earlier I might buy a case of beer that night.&lt;br/&gt;\nShe shows up unannounced and probably under the influence of some other drug and only cares about the beer.

I also just finished school so I don't have studying to distract me or give me a sense of achievement anymore and I have no hobbies because they are expensive. I cant even get a job even though I try so hard and had almost perfect grades, nothing seems to be going right for me at the moment.

Ever since then, nothing I see is straight anymore. Walls tend to shift, words bend up and down, I can't even imagine scenery without it becoming distorted and unstable. Another issue of this is as I try to study its properties i can't differ what are symptoms of it and what else is anxiety. One note I have taken is that my perception tries to almost auto correct if it thinks something should move (like when I am scrolling down all the way and I cant scroll down anymore, i get vertigo downward). It's really curious and I have been to my GP, Eye doctor and ear doctor and they've summed it up to be anxiety. My question is have any of you dealt with or know someone who has dealt with this?

I made one attempt and was stopped by my loved ones (my two partners and my housemate, all of whom I love so much.) I declined to go to the ER as I had work the next day and couldn&amp;#39;t handle the stress of calling my boss. I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking rationally and I should have gone, but all I could think about was how frustrated I was that my attempt didn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually, after I make an attempt the feeling of actively wanting to die goes away but this time, it didn&amp;#39;t. Two weeks went by and I started to feel more and more suicidal and unhinged, like I was actually losing my mind. I was still worried about missing work however, so I decided to schedule some annual leave in order to have my breakdown. (nuts, I know, but guys, my boss is seriously scary.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this,  I emailed a local acute mental health department and asked them for more information about inpatient procedures. Instead of replying to my email, they called me (how they got my number I don&amp;#39;t know) and we organized an appointment for me to speak to someone on Friday morning. I asked my girlfriend if she would take me and she agreed that she would. The day beforehand the anticipation was too much and I planned another attempt during the day to go through with that evening, but my friends and partner found out about it and I promised I&amp;#39;d hold on until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friday morning came (half an hour before my appointment time) and I get a text asking to reschedule my appointment. At this point I broke down into tears because Id been psyching myself up for this appointment for two days and resisted attempting again because I wanted help. So my girlfriend and housemate took me to the emergency room and I told them how i&amp;#39;d been feeling. Before I went in I was already worried that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be taken seriously. When I&amp;#39;m in the midst of an attempt i&amp;#39;m a mess of tears and usually on the ground screaming, but when I&amp;#39;ve given up hope I get quiet and a little fidgety, which I suppose, for all intents and purposes, makes me look less suicidal than I actually am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man who assessed me (Steven. Ugh, seriously, effing Steven) seemed to have already made his mind up about my case before he&amp;#39;d even entered the room, telling me the best course of action was a GP visit and a mental healthcare plan before he&amp;#39;d even really asked me what the problem was. My girlfriend and housemate kept trying to give more information (that I was violent when I attempted, kicking/screaming/etc, that I didn&amp;#39;t feel safe anymore, and i&amp;#39;d felt this way for weeks now) but he kept insisting that a psychologist appointment soon was a better option for me, despite my current active desire to attempt, and despite my not feeling safe. He compared my situation to that of another patient, he told me my life was good and that I had effectively nothing to be sad about, and that I should just look on the bright side. He said that he was positive that his supervising Doctor (he was a psych nurse) would say the same thing and so he didn&amp;#39;t need to tell them about me or my case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a panic attack and he left the room, irritated, saying my attack was &amp;quot;behavioural&amp;quot; (as if I was making it up to get attention? Maybe? I&amp;#39;m not sure what he meant by that) and that he&amp;#39;d come back when I&amp;#39;d calmed down. When he returned he repeated all the same things and at this point I just gave up because I didn&amp;#39;t have the energy to protest/didn&amp;#39;t want to be labelled uncooperative. I left feeling like I needed to try harder in my next attempt, which is obviously the opposite of what I needed from that consult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the car park, I had another panic attack as my girlfriend was calling nearby bulk billing general practices to see if they had availability. None of them did, and when she explained that her girlfriend was currently panicking in a hospital car park because she desperately wanted off the planet but nobody would listen, every single one of them said I needed to go to the ER. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after she wasn&amp;#39;t able to find a doctor who could see me that day, my girlfriend called the hospital crisis line and asked how we should proceed. She was transferred BACK TO STEVEN who told her that I was being unreasonable (yeah, I&amp;#39;m not thinking rationally, I&amp;#39;m suicidal, it kind of goes with the territory) and that if I really wanted to, I could come back and wait to be seen by a registrar which would be a &amp;quot;lengthy and emotionally taxing process&amp;quot; and they would likely say the same thing he said. My girlfriend told him that the doctors she&amp;#39;d spoken to advised her to take me to the ER as I wasn&amp;#39;t safe in my current state, and he said AND I QUOTE: &amp;quot;Oh, GP&amp;#39;s are too conservative.&amp;quot; It seemed like GPs over the phone who hadn&amp;#39;t even met me were more concerned than Steven was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We finally got an appointment with a GP for a few hours away and she was sympathetic. She said I needed a two pronged approach, one for immediate results and one for long term growth. She wrote me a mental health plan and psych referral, as well as a letter of recommendation for admission to hospital. She told my friends to &amp;quot;plant their feet&amp;quot; at the next ER and insist that I get put somewhere where I would be safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this letter, we went to a different ER and I was taken to psych emergency, where they took my bag (which included my referral letter) and wouldn&amp;#39;t let me have it to show the registrar. I was told by one nurse that I could have two visitors accompanying me, (which I did, my girlfriend and my housemate) and when my girlfriend had to leave, my other partner took her place. A few minutes later a different nurse came up and said I could now only have one visitor. It all began to feel like a conspiracy, like they knew I wasn&amp;#39;t strong enough to protest being brushed off by myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We waited for a few hours (a horrifying experience in and of itself, so many screaming, hurting, distressed people) before my name was called by a registrar. She refused to let my partner accompany me into the consult room (which made it feel like even more of a conspiracy) She told me bluntly that she&amp;#39;d been in contact with the first hospital and that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have come to a second one, even though I&amp;#39;d been instructed to by a GP. She told me if I was &amp;quot;unsatisfied with my care&amp;quot; from the first hospital I should have told them that. I wanted to say &amp;quot;Yes, I should have, but my anxiety disorder makes that a bit difficult sometimes.&amp;quot; What I did say was... nothing. I shut down again. I shut down and felt even more like the whole system was against me. It felt as if Steven had personally decided that I wasn&amp;#39;t as distressed as I claimed, and had called another hospital to let them know I&amp;#39;d probably present there as well.\nI went home and collapsed, exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They keep calling me to check up, despite them not seeming to care very much when I presented the first time. Yes, I realize that these hospitals have a lot of patients to care for and things are assessed on a scale, but I was extremely disheartened that someone presenting with a very real mental crisis could be dismissed like that.

This may have nothing to do with it but the rest of us from our close circle of friends have all been in relationships numerous times but he on the other had has never formed any kind of relationship (he has never been intimate with anyone before)\n -He works at the hospital and a few months before this whole thing started he had an incident at work which lead him to believe that he may have contracted a very serious disease from a used needle (used on an ill patient) being injected in him by accident. The results took months to come out and it turned out he was healthy and nothing happened because of that incident, however he describes this period (waiting for the results to come out) as very dramatic/horrifying and the most possible cause of his current symptomps.\n*I&amp;#39;ve lied to him that I have some stress issues from work which are seriously affecting me mentally and I am considering of seeking professional help. This caused him to open up and tell me that he visits a psychiatrist once a week to no apparent results so far (he has been visiting him for months now, not sure how many).\n*I have found in his house 2 pill boxes (Zyprexa, one box which contains 10mg and one of 5mg), he doesnt know I&amp;#39;ve found them and he has only admitted that he takes pills for his stomach which from Googling I understand that these pills are used for treatment of depression (or other compulsive illnesses?). These pills have caused him to faint twice so far which made me try to make him stop which I think it was the wrong move on my behalf as these pills may be the only thing keeping him going even if I see him getting worse in the end.\n*extremely long hours of sleep, I understand that this is another sign of depression, he always enjoyed sleeping for long hours but he now does it in a more unpredicted manner and takes event lengthier sleeps than before, for example last night he slept around 5 in the morning and woke up today at 18:00 and when I asked him if he is ok he replied with &amp;quot;Dude WTF! I&amp;#39;ve been sleeping this whole time!&amp;quot;, even he was shocked from the amount hours he slept and didnt even realise it.\n*besides two incidents he hasnt shown me he may be suicidal\n -the first incident was that I was cooking in his apartment and took the kitchen knife and directed it in his belly and pretended to stab himself. This may be nothing but I would like to mention it in case it is.\n -The second incident is caused by our other friends who at times are not being understanding or compassionate of his situation, they keep pushing him to go out (nightclubs and drinks etc) which he can no longer do at the same frequency he used to due to his stomach issues.

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago. Ever since, my life has had ups and downs but I can say I&amp;#39;m on the edge most of the time. Lately, I have been pretty down and I&amp;#39;ve felt constantly anxious. But there&amp;#39;s something that worries me even more. I am a music junkie. I breathe music. Music has been my only friend when I had no one. I listen to a variety of music, even though I like rock/metal the most. For the past 3-4 months, I have been slowly losing my passion for music, and it kills me. Music used to be my medicine. Nowadays, simply seeing my playlist gives me anxiety. When I try to listen to a song, my anxiety goes crazy. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll force myself to listen to my favorite songs, but I always end up feeling like I&amp;#39;d rather not listen to music anymore. I thought the genre was an issue, so I started to search for different music. After weeks of trying out new music, the result was the same: no matter what band or music genre I try to listen to, all music makes me anxious, nervous, and I pretty much hate the way it makes me feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there&amp;#39;s something SUPER CREEPY happening to my brain when I listen to old songs. This doesn&amp;#39;t happen with newly discovered music, it only happens with old songs. If I try to listen to a song that I really used to like, my brain basically acts like it doesn&amp;#39;t recognize the song, which is IRONIC, because that particular song defined a whole era in my life. For instance, when I hear the intro, my brain doesn&amp;#39;t associate it with something that I&amp;#39;ve previously heard, I get a feeling of NOT being familiar with the song (again, ironic, since I&amp;#39;ve basically listened to that song for about 500 times). Other times, I will listen to a song and somewhat like it, I can recognize the good parts of the song, I can recognize what I LIKE about the song, and I EVEN GET CHILLS of pleasure while listening to it. However, the emotion, the feeling is missing. There is no memory attached to the song, there&amp;#39;s nothing that indicates to my brain that I used to like that song in the past as well. So, most of the time I can&amp;#39;t enjoy music at all, sometimes I can even HATE the sound of it. Other times, I can recognize the quality of the music, but I don&amp;#39;t have any memory of ever listening to it. For instance, when we listen to a song, our brain associates it with a certain feeling. When you listen to a slow, calm song, your brain might associate it with a feeling of melancholy or nostalgia. I used to have a certain feeling associated with EVERY song in my playlist. I used to have songs that made me feel happy, sad, excited, energetic, melancholic, angry, etc. Now all these feelings associated with the songs are gone. I can hear when a song feels good to my ears but I don&amp;#39;t feel any kind of emotion attached to it.

It&amp;#39;s killing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello guys. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago. Ever since, my life has had ups and downs but I can say I'm on the edge most of the time. Lately, I have been pretty down and I've felt constantly anxious. But there's something that worries me even more. I am a music junkie. I breathe music. Music has been my only friend when I had no one. I listen to a variety of music, even though I like rock/metal the most. For the past 3-4 months, I have been slowly losing my passion for music, and it kills me. Music used to be my medicine. Nowadays, simply seeing my playlist gives me anxiety. When I try to listen to a song, my anxiety goes crazy. Sometimes I'll force myself to listen to my favorite songs, but I always end up feeling like I'd rather not listen to music anymore. I thought the genre was an issue, so I started to search for different music. After weeks of trying out new music, the result was the same: no matter what band or music genre I try to listen to, all music makes me anxious, nervous, and I pretty much hate the way it makes me feel.\n\nAlso, there's something SUPER CREEPY happening to my brain when I listen to old songs. This doesn't happen with newly discovered music, it only happens with old songs. If I try to listen to a song that I really used to like, my brain basically acts like it doesn't recognize the song, which is IRONIC, because that particular song defined a whole era in my life. For instance, when I hear the intro, my brain doesn't associate it with something that I've previously heard, I get a feeling of NOT being familiar with the song (again, ironic, since I've basically listened to that song for about 500 times). Other times, I will listen to a song and somewhat like it, I can recognize the good parts of the song, I can recognize what I LIKE about the song, and I EVEN GET CHILLS of pleasure while listening to it. However, the emotion, the feeling is missing. There is no memory attached to the song, there's nothing that indicates to my brain that I used to like that song in the past as well. So, most of the time I can't enjoy music at all, sometimes I can even HATE the sound of it. Other times, I can recognize the quality of the music, but I don't have any memory of ever listening to it. For instance, when we listen to a song, our brain associates it with a certain feeling. When you listen to a slow, calm song, your brain might associate it with a feeling of melancholy or nostalgia. I used to have a certain feeling associated with EVERY song in my playlist. I used to have songs that made me feel happy, sad, excited, energetic, melancholic, angry, etc. Now all these feelings associated with the songs are gone. I can hear when a song feels good to my ears but I don't feel any kind of emotion attached to it. Sometimes I don't even remember anything about songs that used to be so familiar to me. When I listen to NEW songs, songs that I have never heard in my life, I get confused. I can listen to them for a hundred of times and I still won't know whether I like them or not. I have confusing feelings and I can't pinpoint whether I like a song or not, so I just leave it because of my indecision and never listen to it again.\n\nAnyone else here who feels the same way? I am basically desperate, I am on the verge of crying. I am losing my biggest passion in life, my music. I don't know why I feel this way or what to do. I don't know whether this is anxiety-related or not but I suppose it is, that's what my intuition tells me. Any help guys? I really need advice.

Sincere apologies if it&amp;#39;s a little bit unclear or hard to follow:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m in the right forum, but I&amp;#39;m searching for information about psychiatric drugs which cause the patient to talk to themself. Specifically Adderal, Modafinil, Methylphenidate and similar medications, which somehow disconnect speech centers from voluntary control. And I apologize if my question is unclear. It seems to me that if the speech centers alone are targeted or stimulated, that these sorts of stimulants lead to genuine madness, owing to the patient actually listening to their voices rather than controlling their speech. In other words, if some sort of reflex triggers uncontrollable muttering independent of conscious control, the patient&amp;#39;s train of thought can become directed by these spasms or impulses. It&amp;#39;s terrifying to think that a drug could deliberately target these areas of the brain with an extreme overload of energy, or some sort of hyper-caffeinated stimulation, while at the same time having little or no effect on any other area of the brain. This has happened to me personally with both Adderall and Modafinil, and it&amp;#39;s a side-effect I haven&amp;#39;t found mentioned in any of the studies I&amp;#39;ve been able to find through PubMed. I&amp;#39;m extremely curious whether any psychiatrists have heard of this happening. Can a drug stimulate only speech areas of the brain while doing precisely nothing to any other area of the brain? It&amp;#39;s a terrifying experience, and I&amp;#39;m wondering whether this specific psychosis even has a name. I want to underline that I&amp;#39;m not seeking any kind of medical advice, but rather I&amp;#39;m wondering whether anyone has ever heard of this before? Thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m also wondering if anyone knows how often psychiatrists personally sample the drugs they prescribe? For instance, in my opinion a longterm and open-ended prescription for Adderall &lt;em&gt;cannot possibly have a happy ending.&lt;/em&gt; Surely psychiatrists must know this? Because the difference between me with a giant prescription bottle of pure amphetamine (aka Adderall) and a methhead talking to himself while sifting through a garbage can isn&amp;#39;t necessarily that great.

Also, at this point, the drug seems to have fried my mind &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; as much as any psycho roaming the streets, so these distinctions are becoming almost completely meaningless to me.....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I just posted this in the psychiatry forum, but I realize now that this subreddit is probably a better fit. Sincere apologies if it's a little bit unclear or hard to follow:\n\nI'm not sure if I'm in the right forum, but I'm searching for information about psychiatric drugs which cause the patient to talk to themself. Specifically Adderal, Modafinil, Methylphenidate and similar medications, which somehow disconnect speech centers from voluntary control. And I apologize if my question is unclear. It seems to me that if the speech centers alone are targeted or stimulated, that these sorts of stimulants lead to genuine madness, owing to the patient actually listening to their voices rather than controlling their speech. In other words, if some sort of reflex triggers uncontrollable muttering independent of conscious control, the patient's train of thought can become directed by these spasms or impulses. It's terrifying to think that a drug could deliberately target these areas of the brain with an extreme overload of energy, or some sort of hyper-caffeinated stimulation, while at the same time having little or no effect on any other area of the brain. This has happened to me personally with both Adderall and Modafinil, and it's a side-effect I haven't found mentioned in any of the studies I've been able to find through PubMed. I'm extremely curious whether any psychiatrists have heard of this happening. Can a drug stimulate only speech areas of the brain while doing precisely nothing to any other area of the brain? It's a terrifying experience, and I'm wondering whether this specific psychosis even has a name. I want to underline that I'm not seeking any kind of medical advice, but rather I'm wondering whether anyone has ever heard of this before? Thanks\n\n\nAnd I'm also wondering if anyone knows how often psychiatrists personally sample the drugs they prescribe? For instance, in my opinion a longterm and open-ended prescription for Adderall *cannot possibly have a happy ending.* Surely psychiatrists must know this? Because the difference between me with a giant prescription bottle of pure amphetamine (aka Adderall) and a methhead talking to himself while sifting through a garbage can isn't necessarily that great. I don't have to mug people or go car-hopping in the middle of the night, so criminality-wise we're quite different, but we both share the experience of being high during our day-to-day lives. And actually, I'm likely taking *way more* than the average meth user. Yet somehow the term \"speed freak\" isn't generally used to describe functional people.

See I have a 8 year old step-son, 13 year old step-daughter, and a 2 month old daughter at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the 13 year old has something called Intermittent explosive disorder. Not medically diagnosed from what Im aware of, her biological father has it and her behavior is entirely the same as his. \nI&amp;#39;ll give you a quick description of her behavior and maybe someone would be able to give me some insight on her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My most minor concern is her extreme laziness, I know 13 year olds can be lazy but she exceeds a typical 13 year olds behavior. Amounting to extremes such as not wiping herself properly, leaving used tampons on the counter, not washing her hands, not brushing her teeth, etc... she&amp;#39;s had puss filled blisters on her gums and we&amp;#39;ve already had to pull a tooth which wasn&amp;#39;t cheap. Her teeth are rotted and her room reminds me of a crack den.\nMy only concern with that is she touches the baby and brings the baby in her room when we aren&amp;#39;t looking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways I digress, her behavior has us at our wits end. We&amp;#39;ve tried nearly every form of punishment, we&amp;#39;ve tried counselling, we&amp;#39;ve tried medication and we&amp;#39;ve got no progress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all its her everyday behavior, I&amp;#39;ve grown to call it &amp;quot;Alexa&amp;#39;s world&amp;quot; where she is more then convinced the world functions according to her. Ranging from small non-concerning facts like raining falling up and boogers being pieces of your brain to bigger delusions like she is above the law, all adults should respect her and her wishes, she is not responsible for her actions, and EVERYTHING belongs to her. She truly believes if something is in arms reach its her property, and if it isn&amp;#39;t in arms reach she believes she deserves to have it. She has even reached an extent to which she feels entitled to other peoples money and belongings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the biggest concern of mine are her explosions. They happen for no reason at all but you can always see them coming. Ranging from a day to a week she is in constant pursuit of conflict. She&amp;#39;ll talk back to everyone, start fights with her brother or beat on him, get in trouble at school, destroy something, mistreat the baby, and break the 1 rule we have established in the house. This is all in pursuit of conflict, she wants to create that confrontation to allow her to trigger herself into a explosive fight where she becomes physically abusive. She&amp;#39;ll say things she feels will hurt us emotionally, disgusting words that you couldn&amp;#39;t imagine a 13 year old saying. After the initial explosion subsides she spends a few hours in her room trying to figure out ways to hurt us further, this ranges from calling the police, her father, etc... to even one incident where she blew her nose until it bled then accused me of giving her a bloody nose. She has yelled for help outside of her bedroom window and even countlessly tried running away. Once that phase passes she falls into a fake remorse phase (she admitted to never actually being sorry because she feels she is the victim and she is not wrong) In this fake remorse stage she&amp;#39;ll cuddle up to you and apologize in hopes you forgive her and never speak of it again. If you refuse to forgive her or if you bring it up again that usually triggers a second explosion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently we are concerned she is somehow sending nude photos to boys in her school based on some messages we&amp;#39;ve read of hers. We know her number one priority is popularity but with her delusional lifestyle she pursues it in all the wrong ways. Going to different extremes for &amp;quot;acceptance&amp;quot; which is what resulted in her beating her brother for the entertainment of her friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have video evidence of her brutally beating her 8 year old brother, Im currently documenting everything she does in case I need it for evidence. My concerns are for the rest of the family, the impact it has on her siblings being exposed to her, the 8 year old often repeats some of the horrible things she says and her actions. She is rough with the baby and has screamed at the baby to shut up at times. There is a record of her pulling a knife on her brother when shes angry to the point where they had to be hidden. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is a exact copy of her father and her father has a history of attempted murder and other mental problems. I really don&amp;#39;t know what we are dealing with here and what are options are. We are limited considering she isn&amp;#39;t Canadian so a lot of options aren&amp;#39;t available to her. We are trying for her sponsorship but we are doubtful it will be approved given her school record. There are documented incidences where police had to be called. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello, this is my first time posting in this subreddit but Im sincerely concerned.

If you refuse to forgive her or if you bring it up again that usually triggers a second explosion. \n\nCurrently we are concerned she is somehow sending nude photos to boys in her school based on some messages we've read of hers. We know her number one priority is popularity but with her delusional lifestyle she pursues it in all the wrong ways. Going to different extremes for \"acceptance\" which is what resulted in her beating her brother for the entertainment of her friends. \n\nI have video evidence of her brutally beating her 8 year old brother, Im currently documenting everything she does in case I need it for evidence. My concerns are for the rest of the family, the impact it has on her siblings being exposed to her, the 8 year old often repeats some of the horrible things she says and her actions. She is rough with the baby and has screamed at the baby to shut up at times. There is a record of her pulling a knife on her brother when shes angry to the point where they had to be hidden. \n\nShe is a exact copy of her father and her father has a history of attempted murder and other mental problems. I really don't know what we are dealing with here and what are options are. We are limited considering she isn't Canadian so a lot of options aren't available to her. We are trying for her sponsorship but we are doubtful it will be approved given her school record. There are documented incidences where police had to be called. \n\n\n ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7dv1mw", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I feel like my step-daughter is a danger to the rest of my family", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 27, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1511033048.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7dv1mw", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7dv1mw/i_feel_like_my_stepdaughter_is_a_danger_to_the/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1511061486.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7dv1mw/i_feel_like_my_stepdaughter_is_a_danger_to_the/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Mikedivine", "created_utc": 1511032686.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really want to tell people how much I hate myself but I can&amp;#39;t even honestly tell my therapist.

A place to be just who I am.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: Clarified a sentence or two and corrected some grammar.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7djk3i", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Thank you, you sweet, sweet people of questionable mental capabilities.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 24, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qirg", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1510995790.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7djk3i", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/mentalhealth/comments/7djk3i/thank_you_you_sweet_sweet_people_of_questionable/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1510937180.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7djk3i/thank_you_you_sweet_sweet_people_of_questionable/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "HiPitch", "created_utc": 1510908380.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mentalhealth", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 38}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.mentalhealth", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and mild ADD (Prescribed Lexapro and Adderall).

Never be ashamed/sacred to speak out. We are all unique and beautiful.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mother was an angry, manipulative, aggressive, violent and exceptionally unhappy woman. Long term bi-polar disorder mixed with a childhood she never speaks of, but small hints of violent/unhappy childhood given away in small doses over the course of my life. She was her own worst enemy and from a young age somewhat of an idol to myself. She never dealt with her emotions which is also something she taught me. Unhappy/worried? Get angry and violent. Sad or excited? Eat. Ignore the current state and use something else. The list is endless but teaching me not to deal with my emotions was the first stage, installing what she believed to be correct way to thank and act. She began to enforce rewards systems to control me, at times, through eating/food or gifts/money. I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas. This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town. Apparently, they were all \u2018bad\u2019 children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected. The kids that I did hang about with ended up doing very well in life which is why I struggle to see her point of view. I was not allowed to out and play with the other local kids, I was to stay within the confines of my home creating both emotionally and physically unhealthy child (obese from a young age). I had to find happiness inside my own mind/imaginations. This resulted in being a very socially unaware child, not knowing how to deal with conversations, behaviours or social norms. All behaviours were learned from mother, which looking back was destined to be my ruin. By the time I had got to High School it became very apparent. Overwhelmed by different personalities, fear kicked in, so I did what I knew best. Anger and violence. I put up walls to everyone around me, being rejected to groups is not something I experienced. I was vulnerable, completely disconnected and alone. The irony was that in the run up to attending high school mother repeatedly told me \u201cyou are going to get bullied to fuck, kids like you always get bullied. You will never make friends\u201d. She installed failure from the start. Her \u201cassumptions\u201d came to life, I did end up being bullied. So badly in fact even to this day thinking about how alone I was still brings a tear to my eye. So alone in the world, so lost without a single friend. I will talk about how that impacted me later in another post. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love my dad. Truly one of the strongest men I have ever met, who I hold in high regards, admire greatly and a man I aspire to be. I paint the picture of perfection, but I never always viewed or treated him in this way. My dad made many decisions, which in hindsight were the right decisions but they were the unpopular. This played into mother\u2019s hands, allowed her to bounce me off dad and into her arms, in a sense. Using her manipulative behaviours, she would play the popular vote which was the one any kid would favour. Do homework? you don\u2019t need to. Go for a walk? No, pointless. These sounds petty but I am trying ton condense and give you an idea. She wanted to be the favourite, part of something, use it (which she did) as a weapon against my dad. Threaten to leave know the kids would follow, highlight he would have no life without her and telling me my dad never cared about me, only money (although it worked I now am not sure what she meant by money). It was morbid and cruel. Cold hearted and disgusting, everything she is and consumed by her vulnerability. Her tactics worked, I ended up, for a period, hating my dad. Never wanted to be around him. I remember when he told me he had cancer (I was 8, I think) I acted in such disgusting manner. Told him he was a freak and to never come near me, \u201cI hate you anyway\u201d I screamed. I never did, I loved him but years of misguiding my thoughts and feelings led me to believe this was true. This was not the worst, the beating was. I remember he disagreed with me about something, I became engulfed by anger and beat him. Badly. Threw him to the ground and never stopped. Several broken bones, he lied to the doctor, he fell apparently. I regret nothing in life, never want to change anything but this I do. I would change this, even if it changed me slightly, I never have forgiven myself. I\u2019m sorry dad. Words I have yet to say to him, I will one day I just hope he knows this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not shy from admitting I have suffered from many health troubles, mother being a great influence negatively, both physical and mental, the latter being most prominent. By now you are getting an idea where from, but not just here I will add. My final memories in remembering some of the hate was from the last couple of years regarding my new career, psychiatric nursing. I remember when applying for the course she would mock me, publicly in front of friends and family how \u201cpeople like you\u201d could be a nurse, in that field. This was a constant, apparently, I was not good enough to be one, my flaws making me \u201cuseless\u201d and nobody would \u201chire or work\u201d with someone like me. Unfortunately for her, even though (I hate to admit) these words hurt, years of working on who I am, becoming self-aware, working on dealing with emotions and no longer living with her, allowed me to grow into the man I am today. Her attempts to break me down, play the sinner and saint failed. Trying to bully me, manipulate my dad\u2019s advice of be who I want to be and get inside my head did not work. I am strong now, still to this day I work on my emotions, working on how I act in social situations. Working on who I am, along with help from councillors I have managed to overcome this situation with mother. I despise my mother for all the hate she installed, and I have no relationship with her anymore which has made me happier.  I have the best relationship with my dad and I am living life, with all my flaws in the open.

Next I take my meds.. that's where it starts... an hour or so passes i don't move off the couch. If I do its to go back to the bedroom to be alone and collect myself. (Pretty much tell myself I'm dumb what am I doing) \n\nThen the prozac kicks in and my legs are tingling and I can't stop moving them but I'm mad and happy and energized! \n\nWith nothing to do, no hope to get a job go to school the store or even make myself eat. I eat 1x a day and that's if my boyfriend notices I haven't eaten all day, I wait and think what can I do to make up for this shit mess I call me. If something happens to set me off emotionally I lose all of it. Crying uncontrollably shaking thinking of hurting myself just to make my mind shut the fuck up and realize my life's not horrible.  It's not great but there's worse off people and I am thankful for my life but I don't deserve it. Then I breakdown and tell my boyfriend what I'm thinking.. that I should triple my dose or quad . Or just take it all will that make me better .. normal.. then the threats start \"i'm calling an ambulance ur going to the hospital\" this just makes me livid.  And feelings of betrayal loneliness and sadness get worse I feel like they want to get rid of me. Well hell I'd get rid of me too.. but I'd also be a good friend to myself. If I wasn't me. I'd notice how much pain I'm in and be helpful.  But I don't have any friends.. I don't leave my house. I used to but haven't had friends in a long time no one understood what I was going through not even me. \n\nFuck. Anyone else going through a similar issue.. I'm 24 female.

Therapists really have no idea what the fuck is going on &amp;quot;unconsciously&amp;quot; or in some cases even how to deal with their problems (i met with a therapist who was incredibly insecure about her weight and believed she was fat when she clearly wasn&amp;#39;t.

It feels like they made me dumber and left me in a mental fog. I haven&amp;#39;t taken them for 15 months after having took them for 2 years. It makes your dick numb and everything is less sharp. I can&amp;#39;t cry as much anymore and I don&amp;#39;t get too happy or too sad. It feels like there is always this tension that I&amp;#39;m trying to release but I can&amp;#39;t. No wonder Prozac is banned for people under 18 in the U.K.  The drug companies tested it for SIX WEEKS on rats before they decided it was safe for people to take. Unless you have extremely severe depression/schizoaffective/ bipolar disorder and can&amp;#39;t find a way to manage those things with diet (keto, intermittent fasting, read brain brain and ultra mind solution) exercise, sports, creative outlets that help you get into a flow state, and supplements then you really probably shouldn&amp;#39;t take it. Get some fish oil pills, take vitamin d3, go for a run every day, get some sun and talk to people.  Its like it&amp;#39;s become fashionable to see a therapist and to say that it helps a ton so that maybe whoever you tell that to goes to therapy and you can feel like less of a loser. nobody wants to admit that they didn&amp;#39;t get better in therapy because if you see a therapist you&amp;#39;d better not be the neurotic one who goes for 20 years and doesn&amp;#39;t get any better.

No wonder ******* doesn&amp;#39;t like lavendar. A previous mental health worker said that it was her colour. I have seen it before in a few forms &amp;amp; different people. It threatens to kill me. It threatens my whole family. I think I just drunk nicotine but maybe it&amp;#39;s because I just had a cigarette &amp;amp; drank a whole bottle of water. He keeps doing this to me &amp;amp; now he has stolen my dad&amp;#39;s voice to talk to me. Or maybe he is still talking to my dad. He was talking to my dad ages ago asking who the pedophile was and my dad was saying it was me. I really don&amp;#39;t understand this pedophile thing. He keeps asking me if I still want to live at home. &amp;quot;Do you still want to live at home thunderchunksofme&amp;quot; I am not sure why I chose that name but I now think that it is someone who is dead. He keeps saying stop me. But I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t stop any of this. They come round whatever house I am living at &amp;amp; abuse me. By abuse I mean they do things to me that are so bad I forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they &amp;#39;change&amp;#39; me slowly over time so I can&amp;#39;t remember. Because they don&amp;#39;t want me to. He wants to kill me. Earlier he said to my dad that &amp;quot;so your daughter doesn&amp;#39;t abuse anymore children&amp;quot; but I haven&amp;#39;t abused any. So they change reality so that when I say that I haven&amp;#39;t they can be right because they want me to be a pedophile because they want to be right. &amp;quot;A pedophile leaves the house to post a letter&amp;quot; was said outloud by light blue and white this morning. I was leaving the house to post a letter. I then couldn&amp;#39;t leave the house again. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be the pedophile in their story but they want one they are obsessed. I think they want a murder. I think they wanted me to kill my father or mother or for them to kill me. Or for them to kill myself but apparently even suicide is too good for me. As I said I dissociate which is what they wanted. &amp;amp; The crisis team said that they couldn&amp;#39;t come round this evening due to &amp;quot;risk factors&amp;quot; or some other bullshit but my dad was in, he even spoke to them. So now I have to take my &amp;#39;newly&amp;#39; dissociating self miles away to see the crisis team. Never mind that the ambulance team sat with me a few nights before. Never mind that I am in crisis. Never mind that. I was perfectly calm and sat and spoke to them but no &amp;quot;risk factors&amp;quot; so games must be played with me. I even thought I had aids for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am being told that they did come round tonight. But I don&amp;#39;t remember them coming round. Somehow there is something that is layering reality. Round and round it goes. Showing me myself over a period of time. Smoking. Showering. Picking up a cd. Stabbing myself with a needle. Layering. Constantly layering every fucking thing.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Telling me it will kill me if it gets me again. &amp;quot;Kill it they say&amp;quot; I think they want to kill me. I hit my head. I cut myself. I take overdoses. Welcome to schizophrenia they or it say/says/does want to kill me. I don&amp;#39;t know who to trust. Or who to listen to. I think they are picking off the weak. I don&amp;#39;t know why. We can&amp;#39;t work. So we are useless to society. Vilified in the media. I tried. I tried to work. I lost my job. Whatever it was I didn&amp;#39;t deserve it. I thought I did. Repeated words. Why us? Why if I am not the worst person in society do they keep trying to kill me. Even if I was the worst person in society then still this isn&amp;#39;t fair or just or ethical. They want to arrest me. Which they suceed in doing. So what next? Another arrest for insanity? I went to a&amp;amp;e today. They phoned someone. In front of me. In front of my face. This is the second time that EXACT same thing has happened. I thought that last time tho. But it is the second &amp;amp; not the third. Like a fucking script. I am either following voice commands that I can&amp;#39;t hear or reacting to my environment in anger due to past bad memories/experiences. I forget more &amp;amp; more of my past &amp;amp; my future is falling away from me too. So here I am being fed overdoses by people. Being given overdoses by people.

I was an inpatient in a mental health unit &amp;amp; I was told to go with it. &amp;quot;Just say to them that you are a pedophile and they will leave you alone&amp;quot; but the things said that they were pedophiles as I said before, then I said it. They didn&amp;#39;t leave me alone. I don&amp;#39;t know how to leave them alone. The lavendar or whatever colour aura it is is bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think It&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a bunch of men in command of me. I was made someone&amp;#39;s pedophile but I don&amp;#39;t know why. Or what it means. Is that me smoking from weeks ago or is it someone else?\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to eat my dinner but they lined my dad up with me. It was disgusting. I saw him. In lavendar neon. Or jewell-ly lavendar. Then they changed my reality so there was too much going on. My dinner was light green. But no that wasn&amp;#39;t good enough. So then it had a fluroscent aura in yellow &amp;amp; green. But no that wasn&amp;#39;t good enough either. Somehow they have command of my body. My insides. They get my passwords. They have hacked my phone.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The police showed up at my door asking if I wanted an ambulance. They wanted to take me to another hospital. Have I taken another overdose &amp;amp; do I not know know about it? After I left I was told by yellow that I was their pedophile &amp;amp; they got me.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier I was told that I had no friends left. I think they called my dad at the hospital but it wasn&amp;#39;t him on the phone because he asked if everything was ok &amp;amp; said that he had a missed call from blah blah number. If it wasn&amp;#39;t my dad then who did she speak to?\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I will find out if I have taken an overdose tomorrow. Or not. Earlier they were passing a tablet round &amp;quot;because of their mother&amp;quot; but what does that have to do with me? Because I think they filled that tablet with poison &amp;amp; gave it to me.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I am not allowed to taste it. Or smell it. Or remember them coming round to give it to me in the first place.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this man whoever he is keeps talking to me. My user name was someone elses. So why is it mine now?

My eyes get wide and I get this feeling in my head with a slight shake and then explode.\n\nI've never done anything to physically harm another person and I don't want to, and I don't keep any animals anymore because I don't trust myself. But I know I want to find a way to stop it and I think that IED is what I feel accurately describes this issue.\n\nBut I would like opinions from those who have/have dealt with this before, either firsthand or from the sidelines if you think that it could be a feasible explanation?

I feel like they\u2019d say I\u2019m wasting their time and I\u2019d get over this myself. Is there helplines I can call?
