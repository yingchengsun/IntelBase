A lot of employees have quit, and the company is far smaller than it used to be. As a result, I have less and less actual IT work to do.

We were supposed to be returning to a job site that I was already familiar with, so I agreed and didn&amp;#39;t think twice about it, assuming it&amp;#39;d go like it did last time.

I came to Paris, France to visit my then boyfriend for a few months. This turned into me staying with him a few months, going back home for a few month, etc, until I was able to finally move in with him this past Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first few months I stayed with him he was unemployed, so we were always together, I had no issues going out with him to places and he&amp;#39;s French, so he could just translate for me if need be. Well by my next visit he was working again, so I was now alone in the apartment during the day. At first I was ok with keeping myself occupied in the apartment until he got home, but that quickly grew old. I wanted to be able to go to the park, explore, or just buy groceries on my own while he was at work. I would get ready to go out and get up to the door and just....freeze. My heart would be pounding, I would get light headed, and I would just feel this incredible fear. At first I thought it was because I don&amp;#39;t know the language well enough to even hold a conversation, but that&amp;#39;s really only a small part of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I enrolled in classes to learn French and even tried to take up Yoga, but both were very short lived. My fear was growing so quickly that after a week or two I would just have a mental break down and quit everything. I soon realized that I was actually afraid of running into my neighbor(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our one neighbor is from Argentina and she is definitely not all there. The first time she met me she said she refuses to learn English because she hates Americans (Which I am), yet everytime she&amp;#39;s seen me afterwords she seems to have forgotten that fact. She tries to talk to me in French all the time, and I just constantly say back that I don&amp;#39;t understand. The last time she switched to Spanish for who knows what reason. She makes my anxiety shoot through the roof and I do my best to just avoid her. Before I got here on Saturday, there was a huge ordeal over her hoarding and my husband told her to never talk to him nor I ever again. Of course this has only made me feel even worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got here on Saturday I was hoping I could just jump in to going outside and not caring about the neighbor anymore. Instead I feel like I&amp;#39;m at the worst I&amp;#39;ve ever been. Just now I got ready to go out and stoof at the front door. I literally tipp toed to the door and just listened. I heard the elevator and my mind is instantly going nuts saying &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s her!&amp;quot; Well it wasn&amp;#39;t, but my heart was already racing and I was already sweating. Everytime I went to grab the doorknob I would hear someone make a noise in another apartment that would make me freeze. I was even looking through the peephole to see if anyone was in the hallway. I ended up working myself up so much that I made myself sick and had to rush into the bathroom. Needless to say, I didn&amp;#39;t go outside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for being like this. In American I was never like this. It&amp;#39;s only been an issue here in France. I want to be independent and have a life of my own.

I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before it became this bad I would usually be ok once I got outside, which is why I think this more has to do with my neighbor than anything.

We&amp;#39;re also next door neighbors, as of a few months ago. This is the first time in my life I&amp;#39;ve lost someone to suicide, and like I said, she was literally my only friend. My anxiety and agoraphobia have been so bad this past year that I completely isolated myself and lost all of my friends, except for her.

Since her passing, I&amp;#39;ve missed a ton of school. I left the house once to attend one class, and though I got through class okay, afterwards I had a panic attack that lasted almost two hours. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been thrown backward in my healing, and now more than ever, I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m never going to feel better. I want to give up. I don&amp;#39;t ever want to leave the house again. I don&amp;#39;t want to try anymore.

I see my counselor on Monday, but I&amp;#39;m scared I won&amp;#39;t be able to leave the house to go see her.

I'm also afraid I won't be able to leave my house to see my counselor. I didn't go to the funeral and I hate myself for it.

Because of that I end up avoiding talking to them at all.\n\nI figured since I don't think I'll be making any real friends any time soon I'd focus on finding people to talk to online. I know it's not one or the other but for a long time I thought online friendships would be pointless so it's just that I'm now opening up to the idea. I joined the agoraphobia discord server but I'm just too shy for the group style chatting. I don't really know any other ways you would make friends online. Gaming seems like the obvious answer but what if you don't play games that often?\n\nHow do you explain your agoraphobia to people? Or at least lack of job/school. When I told my one friend what I'm going through he just started to make fun of me for it, so now I just avoid the subject at all costs.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you have more friends online or in  person, and which tend to be more meaningful to you?\n\nAlso,  since this is a mental health related community, I  was curious, do you think it's helpful or harmful to have friendships that center around mental health issues?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "76o8m8", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Handling Friends with Agoraphobia", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 9, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_76o8m8", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/76o8m8/handling_friends_with_agoraphobia/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1508157907.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/76o8m8/handling_friends_with_agoraphobia/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "alienpigyep", "created_utc": 1508129107.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m starting to display symptoms of Panic Attack Disorder and am working with a psychologist.

I immediately started feeling exactly what I was imaging in my head (the nausea) and there was no exit nearby. I started RUNNING full speed out of the mall because I didn\u2019t want to vomit everywhere. The nausea lasted for about 15 minutes and then faded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gosh. I feel so crazy.

I can\u2019t even really hang out with friends because i feel like I\u2019d be unable to escape them if I suddenly had one of these attacks. I\u2019ve yet to vomit from this but it really feels like I will and I\u2019m convinced that one day if I\u2019m in a scary enough situation, I will. This is what keeps me confined to my safe zones.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if these are panic attacks, or if I\u2019m seriously thinking myself into being nauseous from these graphic thoughts. That\u2019s really incredible if I can just make myself nauseous on cue like that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how the body works.. but maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m starting to feel crazy. My sister suggested that it\u2019s not nausea I\u2019m feeling, but maybe sheer panic, and since I\u2019m emetophobic, I associate it with nausea.\n\nI\u2019m currently on anxiety medication. I was prescribed Ativan, and I\u2019ve only taken it twice when I had a friend over. I seemed to be okay on the medication but I\u2019m still too scared to venture out of my safe zone, even on it. \n\nThis all started about a year ago in a large mall when I started having graphic thoughts about the last time I was almost sick and what it felt like. I immediately started feeling exactly what I was imaging in my head (the nausea) and there was no exit nearby. I started RUNNING full speed out of the mall because I didn\u2019t want to vomit everywhere. The nausea lasted for about 15 minutes and then faded.\n\nGosh. I feel so crazy. So stuck. There\u2019s so much I want to do but I\u2019m a prisoner of my own brain.\n\nCan someone please give me some insight and maybe some reassurance. I want to live, I want to date, I want to go out and have fun. I\u2019ve missed funerals and weddings due to this.  Every doctor I explain this to just tells me to take medication and get on with my life. I try so hard, but some days I just can\u2019t.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "73weqm", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "On a whim", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_73weqm", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/73weqm/on_a_whim/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1507013639.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/73weqm/on_a_whim/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "probablyinmyundies", "created_utc": 1506984839.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey people, I&amp;#39;m pretty new to (home-bound) agoraphobia, I had a breakdown in June 2016 after being spiked with a drug.

I&amp;#39;m really sorry it&amp;#39;s so long.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little backstory (I&amp;#39;ll try to keep it brief):\nI was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at age 9, I&amp;#39;ve been in and out of therapy/counseling my whole life since (I&amp;#39;m 25 now). The anxiety has been the worse of the two, changing in severity throughout life. Had a rough upbringing, lots of mental illness in the family, so anxiety was almost constant for me. The first (and only other) time I struggled with agoraphobia was back in high school. It was also accompanied with an eating disorder where I literally couldn&amp;#39;t eat away from the safety of my home, which caused me to loose a lot of weight from my already tiny build. I ended up just pushing through it somehow. I&amp;#39;m still not sure how I graduated, I missed so much school. One thing led to another and I left home at 17, moved in with a friend, got my first job, and started at the community college in town. All of a sudden my anxiety and agoraphobia just DISAPPEARED. I finally broke 100 pounds, made a ton of friends, joined a gaming/nerd club, bought my own car, went out constantly, and felt like a &amp;quot;real person&amp;quot;. I even traveled some, which I was always too anxious to do growing up. I ended up leaving college two years in and working full time, but I was happy to be independent and support myself. While my anxiety was almost non existent for some reason in my early 20&amp;#39;s, I had a couple extremely traumatizing events happen to me which lead to me being diagnosed with PTSD. One of these events was my father passing away from terminal brain cancer. Back to therapy I went. I also spent 6 years in an extremely abusive relationship (mental/emotional/mildly physical). This eventually took a huge toll on my mental health, and everything else just caught up to me. I had depression, anxiety, and panic attacks again. Bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended the abusive relationship when I met my current partner, and I feel so lucky to have found this man. Once again, my anxiety pretty much disappeared (with the occasional flare up). He made (and still makes) me so happy. The first 2 or so years of our relationship were almost perfect, I was so happy and full of life. My life changed so dramatically and very quickly, but it all felt positive and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Trying to shorten this story, sorry) Life was great! I went to a trade school and started a career I was crazy excited about. One day, a week before graduating from that school, completely out of nowhere, I had my first panic attack in years. The worst panic attack I&amp;#39;ve ever experienced to this day. It shook me to my core. I&amp;#39;ve never felt fear that intense. It caused my anxiety to come back hard and I struggled with it for about a year while working my new job..but it got so bad that I ended up getting fired for the first time ever from a job I really (thought) I liked in the career field I had just started and had worked hard to achieve. That was exactly a year ago now and I haven&amp;#39;t worked a day since..and I&amp;#39;ve barely left the house. My panic attacks are brutal and almost daily, and about 6 months ago I realized that my agoraphobia is back and 1,000 times worse than it was the first time. This feels like a different beast all together. I didn&amp;#39;t know I could feel this bad. Unlike any other time in my life, the anxiety has complete control over me and I can&amp;#39;t seem to get my life together. I seem to be getting worse by the day, and I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m beyond help. I&amp;#39;ve forgotten what my &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; used to feel like, what living without constant fear was like, and I&amp;#39;m terrified that I&amp;#39;ll never know that peace again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner is insanely loving, supportive, caring, understanding, and patient. If I didn&amp;#39;t have him, I&amp;#39;m afraid of what I would do to myself. He&amp;#39;s been supporting us financially for the past year, but money has gotten so tight. He&amp;#39;s a full time student on top of working part time, and we mostly just live off of his financial aid. He convinced me to give college another shot, so all of the sudden I&amp;#39;m back at fucking college and it&amp;#39;s been a fucking nightmare. I haven&amp;#39;t been in college in 5ish years..I feel like a fish out of water.. but I finally have new dreams and goals again that I desperately want to pursue. This anxiety and agoraphobia is threatening to ruin everything and I&amp;#39;m at a loss of what to do. I thought for sure that just &amp;quot;pushing through&amp;quot; and abruptly going back to college, thus getting back into the real world, would somehow &amp;quot;fix me like it did the first time&amp;quot;. Then maybe I could go jump back into the working world and feel normal again! Exposure therapy, right? NO. I was so fucking wrong. This is torture and is making my mental health so much worse. I&amp;#39;m 4 weeks into classes now and it&amp;#39;s not getting easier. I&amp;#39;m only taking two, and they&amp;#39;re only twice a week, and we fixed our schedules so that my boyfriend can be by my side every second that I&amp;#39;m not in class..but despite all of the precautions I took, i&amp;#39;m scared that i&amp;#39;m gonna give up. To make things worse, our car (the one I worked hard to pay for for) was just repossessed. We&amp;#39;re struggling so hard and fell behind on payments..now we are completely without transportation. I&amp;#39;m a wreck without that car. It was the only way I could leave the house, it was my second comfort zone. It meant a quick escape for me, a get away when the panic would hit me away from home, being in control of where I went and when I left anywhere. Since then I am petrified to leave the house, I can&amp;#39;t even get the mail anymore. My boyfriend is okay with just taking the bus to campus, but I refuse. It&amp;#39;s way too far out of my comfort zone and triggers crazy panic attacks. I tried walking to the bus stop one morning but ending up running home hyperventilating and skipping class. It was awful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made an appointment with one of the free school counselors. It&amp;#39;s on Monday morning before my first class and I&amp;#39;m thinking of any excuse to cancel it. I&amp;#39;m completely torn. I desperately want to feel better, but I&amp;#39;m terrified of taking that first step towards healing. I&amp;#39;ve seen about a dozen different therapists, counselors, psychiatrists, etc throughout my life...but this feels so different. I&amp;#39;m horrified. What if i&amp;#39;m beyond help? Will they think i&amp;#39;m crazy and lock me up? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I should note that despite all the previous therapy, I&amp;#39;ve surprisingly never taken ANYTHING for my mental illnesses. It&amp;#39;s of course been offered to me in the past, many times, but I always refused and managed without it. I hate medication, it scares me to death when I think about trying it...but i&amp;#39;m in such a bad place this time..i&amp;#39;m curious if if would actually help me? I&amp;#39;ve heard so many horror stories about medication, especially the &amp;quot;you feel worse for a few weeks and then feel better&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t imagine feeling worse than I do now. But if meds would help give me that push I need to get out of the door, i&amp;#39;m confident I could handle the rest of the healing on my own..ugh, it&amp;#39;s a scary thought. I wouldn&amp;#39;t even know how to bring it up to a counselor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of just &amp;quot;surviving&amp;quot;, I want to live again...but i&amp;#39;m losing hope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(sorry this was so long, I&amp;#39;m in a bad place and this all just came spewing out of me.

I rushed home and managed to get to the toilet just in time. This was extremely weird and new for me, but I tried to forget it and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I had an appointment in the morning with some people I didn&amp;#39;t know that well. On my way there, the same feeling took control of me, and I was convinced I was going to shit myself or pass out before I got there. I was early, and I sat next to one of the guys I was meeting up with in the middle of a crowded square. Sweating, having spaghetti legs, extreme anxiety and the bowel movements were at an all-time high. I made it through the rest of the appointment somehow, going to the toilet about 4 times in the 2 hours I was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This made it clear to me it wasn&amp;#39;t a one-time thing, and I started going out slightly less. I also started wearing nothing but black jeans with a shirt tied around my waist, just in case I wouldn&amp;#39;t make it to the toilet in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short: This became more and more frequent, until it started happening every single time I stepped outside, and I thought I was going insane. I went to my doctor, who sent me on to the psychologist, who diagnosed me with social anxiety and agoraphobia and we started an exposure treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the first 2 weeks, it only got worse, and my avoidance behaviour was at an all-time high. I worked from home, whenever friends came over I asked them to do me a favor and pick up some groceries along the way, and I started accepting that this was the way it was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt comfortable in my own home, but felt terrible whenever I went outside. So I would just avoid going outside on every occasion I would get, and I made up excuses in my head on why it was okay to stay inside that day. This started repeating itself pretty much every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also started skipping some psychologist sessions (which is expensive, don&amp;#39;t skip them) and when I did manage to show up, she would have me do breathing exercises for the first 15 minutes I was there just so I could breathe and talk normally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided I wasn&amp;#39;t ready for exposure therapy yet, and I got started on medication (The SSRI called Citalopram) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first 3 weeks of medication were terrible, I didn&amp;#39;t notice any improvements, my constant fear only got worse, and I could barely sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After those 3 weeks however, the side effects passed, and we started doing exposure therapy from scratch:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The first week, I tried going outside at night, riding around on my bike every night. Once that worked, I did the same thing, during quiet times at day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The second week, I had to walk a few miles. Again, first during the nighttime, and then during the day. I couldn&amp;#39;t fight the feeling during one of those walks and quickly turned around, which was a bad move. Nothing would have happened if I kept walking, but the next time I had to go outside would be slightly worse again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The third week, I had to go to a store again. I made sure there was no line at the counter before I went in, and I managed to do it without anything going completely wrong. I went to a more crowded store the same week.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The fourth week, I went out with my friends again (alcohol makes it a lot easier though) and I could handle being on my bike pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This went on and on, until being out in public was still uncomfortable, but I didn&amp;#39;t feel the intense fear anymore, and the feeling of shitting myself and passing out were (are) still there sometimes, but they pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, it was time for something I had avoided for months: I had to go and get a haircut. This was one of my biggest fears, and I would be lying if I said I didn&amp;#39;t have a glass of wine to calm my nerves a bit before I went out. Once again: The fear was there, but nothing bad happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skip forward to today: I started doing a new semester in college, signed up for a new sport club (the first time going out to training was extremely scary though, as I knew nobody there, but I&amp;#39;m glad I did go) and I&amp;#39;m now going to college every day, training 3 times a week and I feel like I&amp;#39;m almost entirely back in control of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still wearing nothing but black jeans, but I am leaving the shirts to tie around my waist at home, and every time the anxious feeling comes up, I wait it out until it passes and go on with my day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my story so far, and I really wanted to share.

Be it family members who bring people down of family members that tend to ask for money and gamble it all away. Because they both had rough childhoods they decided that when they have a family then it would always be us first. Which is very nice and logical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend has had agoraphobia for around 7 years now I think. He and I are going on 2 years next month. He&amp;#39;s 30 and im 21. Yes the age gap is a little weird and me being 21 gives even more reason for my parents to be concerned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend recently lost his father to cancer. His mother is also agoraphobic. Not as bad as his but bad enough that she can&amp;#39;t work. Plus even if she tried she&amp;#39;s 60 years old with a 30 year work experience gap. He has a nice younger sister going to college and an older brother who can work but gambles his money away. His father had life insurance but was apparently all used up for the wake and the funeral. His mother has decided to sell the house in the spring and move in with their aunt. The aunt lives an hour away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With everyone going separate ways soon, this could potentially leave my boyfriend with no home and no job and just a bit of savings. Most of which has already gone to helping his family out. And with his agoraphobia he can&amp;#39;t go very far, restocked not all the way to his aunt&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is working on getting better before the spring which is 5-6 months from now or maybe less. He&amp;#39;s starting to take xanax as well, which is how his mother got better, but he absolutely refuses to take SSRI&amp;#39;s (He tried it for a month, it didn&amp;#39;t work, he stopped). The xanax seems to be working but it&amp;#39;s gonna take a long while before he&amp;#39;s better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now by spring i want to help him. Maybe with money or something. He can&amp;#39;t stay with my family because we love in an apartment so it&amp;#39;s too small. My parents refused. He maybe allowed for just a month but they said &amp;quot;sure but that&amp;#39;s not gonna help him anyway&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents started talking to me about how im wasting my time. They like my boyfriend as a person, he&amp;#39;s kind, considerate, mature, responsible, and still funny and a little childish enough to enjoy life. He is honestly everything i could have asked for in a boyfriend and in a person. But they do not want him as my future partner because they don&amp;#39;t believe that he&amp;#39;ll ever be able to support me financially. And that since I&amp;#39;m 21 i shouldnt even be worrying about this yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any thoughts? I&amp;#39;m not really sure what I&amp;#39;m asking out of this though.

I booked two appointments online and bailed from both because I was so scared of the stress from sitting still for 15 minutes having my eyes tested despite being fine sitting still in the car for 15 minutes being driven to the appointment. \n\nIf you've read this, thank you for spending your time to just let me ramble to you, it's really helped my anxiety right now to just write down what's bothering me right now this second.\nAny motivation, perspectives, advice, or just digital hugs are greatly appreciated and accepted.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7079ar", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "The low intensity CBT made me worse and I just need to vent.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7079ar", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/7079ar/the_low_intensity_cbt_made_me_worse_and_i_just/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1505473872.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/7079ar/the_low_intensity_cbt_made_me_worse_and_i_just/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "phycocrazz", "created_utc": 1505445072.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started a scavenger hunt on our agoraphobia discord server and it&amp;#39;s turned out to be a big hit.

I&amp;#39;ve had agoraphobia for 8 years now. For the first two years I was homebound except for doctors and counseling. I couldn&amp;#39;t drive for the first six years. I did get a lot better during those 6 years, I was able to run into a gas station and sometimes even walmart by myself as long as I could talk on the phone to a friend. My husband had to drive me absolutely every where though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In January 2016 my son was born. By May, we realized I would have no choice but to find work. Thankfully we had moved to a different state, in an extremely small town. My husband started taking me to apply for jobs and driving me to interviews. I got hired immediately by hospice. My first shift was the first time I had drove by myself in six years. Scary as he&amp;#39;ll, but I managed. It did get easier, however I had to quit after 4 months because night shift just was not working out. I took another job at a nursing home. It was much more fast paced, but better money and day shift. Unfortunately, my father-in-law passed away during my 90 day probation period. We had to go out of state for the funeral and they fired me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in March I started a new job. I like it. My managers leave me alone for the most part. I&amp;#39;ve made a really good friend there. I only work 12 hours a week, 4 hour shifts 3 days a week. This is perfect for me. Just enough to get me out of the house ans help pay bills. 2 weeks ago though, my world felt like it got turned upside down. A guy in a different department kept harassing me about everything I was doing wrong in his opinion. My anxiety kicked in and then the panic attacks started. I realized within a day or two that I was having an agoraphobia relapse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I had just recently started back counseling. She went from wanting me to try without meds to seeing this drastic change and saying she recommended medication asap. I fully agree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had been scared to tell my husband about the relapse because I just couldn&amp;#39;t handle the disappointment. I was beating myself up enough as it was. Crying nearly everyday, lashing out, etc. Finally, yesterday, I broke down and told him. First, it was all about him, how he didn&amp;#39;t know what to say because he never did anything right anymore. Told him the guy at work is what caused my relapse so he could put his mind at ease. He told me to quit my job. I had to explain that running from it won&amp;#39;t help. He has anxiety attacks maybe 2 or 3 times a year. He has quit multiple jobs over it, so I guess he expected me to do the same. I have called in to work A LOT lately, even though it&amp;#39;s only 12 hours a week. Sometimes, I&amp;#39;m able to make it up on a different day, but not always. I&amp;#39;m so scared they are going to fire me and have thought about trying to explain to my managers exactly what is going on and asking them to be patient with me as I&amp;#39;m in counseling to get help for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another issue I&amp;#39;m having is I allowed a friend to move up here from my home state. She just moved in last Monday. She sets off my panic attacks just from her personality. She&amp;#39;s very loud and has to use her body when talking, like leaning in close and using her hands in quick movements. I&amp;#39;ve discussed this issue with my therapist and I know I need to explain to my friend what&amp;#39;s going on, but I am so scared if confrontation. I can&amp;#39;t ask her to change who she is and believe I just need to adjust to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is seriously all over the place and not very well written at all. There&amp;#39;s just so much going on in my head right now and no one around me truly understands. I don&amp;#39;t want them to understand. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. It is more than debilitating. Makes me feel like a little kid hiding from the monster under my bed, except, I&amp;#39;m an adult and the monster is in my head...and there&amp;#39;s no escape...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This will be one long ramble, I apologize.

I&amp;#39;ve lurked for a lil bit so why not introduce myself.\nI&amp;#39;ve been mostly housebound for about 7 years now. I&amp;#39;m 21, and it started in the beginning of high school after my sister died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last year or so, I was able to have a somewhat normal life. I was being healthy, taking medication, went out of state, and even started a job. But, soon after my anxiety started up so I was missing a few days, my manger complained and since I didn&amp;#39;t like management&amp;#39;s favoritism/ work ethic, I quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, I get the opportunity to go out of state, to the same place and I&amp;#39;m ecstatic. I think this is what I need to get out of this rut and get things in order. From the start, it doesn&amp;#39;t feel the same way as last time. I don&amp;#39;t have medication so I&amp;#39;m anxious more and depressed. My relative seems to be the same and is also not on medication so you can imagine things didn&amp;#39;t go well. Months after staying with the relative and mostly enjoying my time there, we have a fight and I&amp;#39;m kicked out their house. In the middle of the night, suitcases in hand, phone dead, and barely any money in my debit card. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, by the kindness of some gas station cashiers, I was able to get in contact with my family back home, get a hotel, and fly home the next day.

I've lurked for a lil bit so why not introduce myself.\nI've been mostly housebound for about 7 years now. I'm 21, and it started in the beginning of high school after my sister died. \n\nLast year or so, I was able to have a somewhat normal life. I was being healthy, taking medication, went out of state, and even started a job. But, soon after my anxiety started up so I was missing a few days, my manger complained and since I didn't like management's favoritism/ work ethic, I quit.\n\nThen, I get the opportunity to go out of state, to the same place and I'm ecstatic. I think this is what I need to get out of this rut and get things in order. From the start, it doesn't feel the same way as last time. I don't have medication so I'm anxious more and depressed. My relative seems to be the same and is also not on medication so you can imagine things didn't go well. Months after staying with the relative and mostly enjoying my time there, we have a fight and I'm kicked out their house. In the middle of the night, suitcases in hand, phone dead, and barely any money in my debit card. \n\nThankfully, by the kindness of some gas station cashiers, I was able to get in contact with my family back home, get a hotel, and fly home the next day.

I've only left my house a total of 5 times in the past 2 years.  \nIn the past I've been through all types of therapy, including hypnotherapy and CBT.\n\nI'm just curious to know if anyone is as bad as me because I feel like my agoraphobia is at the worst level you could get. Over time I've developed what I believe to be hypersensitivity (lack of sunlight and daily sounds has made me more aware/paranoid of lighting and sounds in general). \n\nI also get these horrible panic attacks I've never experienced (I've had panic attacks since I was a kid) but these ones I've been getting in the past year are on a different level of severity. It's like I'm having a seizure because my body shakes really hard (it's not the typical nervous shakes) and I end up getting dizzy and I end up having to breath in into a paper bag and I have to take a tranquilliser to calm it all down at once. \n\nI've also noticed that I can't even leave my bedroom that much. I get panicky when I go downstairs. \n\nI'm not bragging, I'm just really concerned because it seems like I haven't come across anyone who is like me. This is a great community but I feel somewhat left out because I seem to be on a very different level.

I don't want to reapply and lose over $12K in backpay.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: added that I have extensive medical documentation &amp; that I don't want to lose $12K+ in backpay", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6o10g0", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "SSI/SSDI for Agoraphobia (NYS)", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6o10g0", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/6o10g0/ssissdi_for_agoraphobia_nys/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1500416088.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/6o10g0/ssissdi_for_agoraphobia_nys/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "mikecriggs", "created_utc": 1500387288.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve wrote about my home life before... in suicide watch...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my mom and step dad are thinking about getting me and my sister out of the house for a while, something like going to a zoo or whatever 3 hours away and staying at a hotel for a night or two, just being on a road trip/different area.

Let me explain with a little history first:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My whole life I have been an anxious person, always worrying about what &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; happen. At 14 I started having problems sleeping because I would stay up all night thinking about and analyzing conversations I had with others. All of the worrying really had me feeling depressed. I was prescribed sleeping pills and prozac. When I felt like the Prozac was not helping my doctor upped the dosage. (This was before they knew that antidepressants had an adverse affect in children.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 14 I tried to commit suicide. Luckily, I was unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also at age 14, I had my first panic attack. I continued to have them randomly but the frequency has increased within the last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped taking medication and life returned to what I consider normal, with the anxiety being fairly low level, but avoiding social situations. I very rarely would go places with friends or co-workers, considering my home my safe space. I did not find it to interfere with my life too much because I was still able to work. I always made some reasonable excuse but the truth is, I didn&amp;#39;t want to be away from my home any more than I had to be. So people stopped asking me to do things. Even my family left me out of things because they knew I would say no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within the last 3 years I have started avoiding places that I know peak my anxiety. I can no longer go to Wal-Mart for fear of having a panic attack. Ok fine, so I do my shopping at a smaller store, closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On June 15th, I woke up having a panic attack. Despite that, I decided to go to work. I do have a fairly stressful job. I work in a call center for a mobile service provider. While the company is great, the job itself takes its toll on you. While at work the panic attack was so bad I started crying and went home. I came in the next day to make up the hours but continued to have panic attacks throughout the day and felt like I was going crazy. They sent me home early and I haven&amp;#39;t been back since. Now I&amp;#39;m scared to go to work because I&amp;#39;m afraid that I will continue to have panic attacks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things have actually gotten VERY bad since then. I barely leave my house and if I do it is never alone. My doctor has put me on paxil, buspar, and amitriptyline but I don&amp;#39;t feel like its working. The soonest he can get me in is the 18th of this month so I&amp;#39;m hoping we can find something that may work better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within the last two weeks, I am having waves of panic attacks nearly every day but I can&amp;#39;t identify a trigger. I wake up having panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve even gone so far as ordering groceries online so that when I do go to the store, I don&amp;#39;t have to be there as long because I only need to get things like milk and eggs. I&amp;#39;ve started looking into work from home jobs but they all seem to involve a similar job to what I currently have and honestly, I don&amp;#39;t know if I can mentally handle that right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m worried that people think I&amp;#39;m faking or making it all up. Family members have even made comments like I need to get off my lazy ass and do something. I have worked my entire life since I was legally able to. It&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t want to work, its that I live in constant fear of when the next panic attack is going to hit. I&amp;#39;m scared to leave my house because I don&amp;#39;t want to be somewhere when a panic attack does hit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that was a lot of information but the main question I have is, &amp;quot;what is happening to me?&amp;quot; Am I going crazy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What medications have you found that works best for you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What am I supposed to do for money?

Basically I was exposing myself to places without calling it &amp;quot;exposure therapy&amp;quot; or anything. I just wanted to dress up, go out, and have fun. The exposure was a bonus.

I&amp;#39;ve typed up my so called story multiple times, and decided not to post for various reasons. Today I am feeling especially low, so I decided to go through with sharing what has gone on in my life since Agoraphobia took over and how even with some victories I haven&amp;#39;t been able to defeat it. This is not to discourage anyone, just to show that we have to have realistic expectations of ourselves lest we fall from a small high so hard we would rather cease to exist than accept we still need help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sit in the sunroom of my girlfriend&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s house, chain smoking and wondering why the hell I still bother existing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was your typical meek High School student. I always had friends, never many, but wasn&amp;#39;t hated or picked on by anyone either. I never tried hard in school, hardly did homework outside of class, and generally didn&amp;#39;t care. I managed to graduate with honors thanks to the weighted GPA all my honors and AP classes gave me, and after taking a year off of school, I went to college. This is where my trouble and first real experiences of anxiety struck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t try in college. I got awful grades, but I had fun. I didn&amp;#39;t party, never even drank to the point of being drunk, and never did any drugs. Yet, I did stay up late, shirk my responsibilities and not really care. I&amp;#39;ve always had a hard time caring and doing things for myself. If it&amp;#39;s for someone else, sure, I&amp;#39;m right on top of it, I do my best to make it happen. It makes me feel good, and that&amp;#39;s my incentive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During my second semester, I was laying in the common room of my dorm one night and I started to feel my chest pound. I had never experienced that sensation before, but it was in a relaxed, dark, quiet environment. The next month I spent in perpetual fear of being sick, thinking something was wrong with my heart, that I was sick, or that I was going to die. I barely went to class. I went to the student clinic four times, and even had blood tests and an ekg done to make sure everything was all right. I left with some anti-anxiety meds I never took. Eventually, I got used to the chest sensation and it was gone. I finished a third semester before having to move back home, and spent the next two years working and hanging out with friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t until about 5 years ago this month that something happened, something so simple that triggered me into a downward spiral I never foresaw. Someone I didn&amp;#39;t know took a picture of me, and the floodgates in my mind broke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I obsessed over what could have drawn them to take the picture. My mind became filled with feelings of paranoia, thinking I was a target and someone or multiple someones were going to hurt or kill me. I hid. I stopped going to work, moved back home with my parents and didn&amp;#39;t leave for a week. After that week, the Agoraphobia had full control over me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fearing any feeling like I felt that day my picture was taken, I didn&amp;#39;t go outside. I couldn&amp;#39;t even open the blinds or windows in my room. I felt physically ill almost all the time, and I slept whenever I could to not feel that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, years and years passed. I started to cut, not deep as some people who struggle with depression, but enough to hurt to distract myself. Or maybe it was because I thought I deserved it. Or I wanted something physical to represent how awful I felt inside. I became severely depressed. I would spend nights walking around with my brothers handgun in the garage, talking to myself, trying to build myself up to putting the gun to my head and not hurting. But I never did. The guilt of knowing what the people who loved me would feel if I committed suicide kept me alive. Knowing that my brother would blame himself since it was his gun, my mother for not noticing how bad I was, etc. etc. I couldn&amp;#39;t do that to them. So I suffered through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 3 years into my depression I had begun to reach out online in a sort of chat/forum website I found called Experience Project. I met some people there, and was able to post about my depression and state of life. It made me feel marginally better. &amp;#39;Friends&amp;#39; on the website would come and go, but the interaction with other people made me feel better. Before I was agoraphobic, I loved having friends around. I didn&amp;#39;t like to go out, but I would always buy my friends dinner in an attempt to coax them to come over and hang out with me. I guess this was my way of not feeling as though I was actually alone in my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A year and a half ago, a girl posted on this website, asking if 30 something hyrdocodone were enough to kill her. I replied, telling her the toilet would be the best place for those and that she should try to do her best to talk to whoever would listen. I thrived on feeling as though I was helping people throughout my whole life, and despite my current situation, I still felt like making myself matter was the only way I could justify still being alive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, a friendship and eventually a relationship developed out of this. She tried to kill herself, taking those pills a couple months after I first replied to her. I sat with her on Skype, (a huge step for me since I had trouble even telling people my real name on that website thanks to my paranoia) and watched as she almost died. Her stepfather came home, called 911 and luckily they were able to save her. Not long after that, we became romantically involved and she even flew out to see me in person. For that week I felt a little like my old self. Still scared to leave the house, but happy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple months later, I flew out to see her and meet her parents. Even though we are 7 years in age apart, her parents had talked with me in person on Skype on multiple occasions and they felt comfortable enough after her coming to see me and returning safely, that they could trust me coming to stay with them and meet them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a few months after that, her step-father had a job opportunity and mentioned it to her. We had been talking about moving closer to each other since we lived on opposite sides of the country. I took a leap of faith, hoping and even praying (not religious but I&amp;#39;m not sure how else to put talking to the &amp;#39;powers that be&amp;#39;) that this might be a chance for me to return to a semblance of normalcy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved out with just a thousand dollars loaned to me from my grandparents. My girlfriend bought me a car, in full. I worked for three months driving around and delivering things. I had my days where I was scared, but I functioned and overcame them. I was finally getting better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a month since I last worked. I quit due to a new policy at my job and me deciding it wasn&amp;#39;t worth jumping through the hoops to stay there. I was also starting to feel slightly more paranoid and took a way out. I found another job 2 weeks after I quit that last one, but I lasted a day. It was very, very physical work and I just couldn&amp;#39;t cut it and had to quit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We come to now. I can barely go outside, go to dinner with her father, get the mail that&amp;#39;s 20 steps away, or even take the trash out to the road. I don&amp;#39;t drive. I don&amp;#39;t leave the house. I&amp;#39;m back on meds and xanax, but even the xanax doesn&amp;#39;t help anymore. It&amp;#39;s my birthday today, and despite the random chance life gave me to live again, I can look it dead in the face and be ungrateful, wishing I could die once again. I can&amp;#39;t seem to find it in me to function. I can&amp;#39;t seem to beat my fears. I can&amp;#39;t seem to break what has taken hold in my head. I&amp;#39;m so lost....and now that I&amp;#39;ve made someone I love happy in a way she hasn&amp;#39;t felt before, I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m going to be the cause of her to hit a new low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in the name of trying to get better. I found love online, of all places, and yet moving to the other side of the country, my fears manifest. I beat them for three months, that was it. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know how to beat them. I&amp;#39;m scared. I&amp;#39;m scared of everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ll do something I know will hurt the people that have invested so much love and time into me. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry. This nonsense was all over the place, and probably doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense. Has anyone else had a setback like this? What do I need to do? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the point I&amp;#39;ll stick an icepick in my brain just to make the fear go away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this, and I hope it finds you well. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is the kind of place for me to come and vent about what might call my 'journey' but I can't find another outlet.

I don't know how to beat them. I'm scared. I'm scared of everything. \n\nWorst of all, I'm afraid I'll do something I know will hurt the people that have invested so much love and time into me. I don't know what to do. \n\n\nI'm sorry. This nonsense was all over the place, and probably doesn't make much sense. Has anyone else had a setback like this? What do I need to do? \n\nI'm at the point I'll stick an icepick in my brain just to make the fear go away. \n\nThank you for reading this, and I hope it finds you well.

I&amp;#39;m gutted but let&amp;#39;s start again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a 32 year old man living in Ireland. Have depression and anxiety for 16 years. I have had thousands of panic attacks and I&amp;#39;m still here. I have attacks about nearly every thing in my life. But they all passed. I wrote before that I am very open about talking about my attacks as I don&amp;#39;t feel ashamed anymore and would like to past that to others. I am no way a guru to this quite the opposite but I&amp;#39;m welling to talk and not afraid. So I&amp;#39;m house bound with anxiety a hermit crab we will say. Been house bound for years but I am happy I just want more in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also excuse the bad grammar and spelling hard to try when brain gone mad. But we will struggle on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I live in Ireland and it&amp;#39;s lovely all green and leprechauns. I don&amp;#39;t drink (I know shocked) I used to go for a few pints but hangovers and anxiety do not mix. I spend most of my time on my PC or with my family. I used to have friends everywhere calling in and out but as you get older that goes away you don&amp;#39;t feel much sadness as its just what happens and I&amp;#39;m still close with every one of them. That&amp;#39;s enough about my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go to a cbt councilor every so often. She has been amazing in so many ways. I used to be so afraid but now I see it as a challenge. I beg anyone that feels they are having any problems go get help why not. If you have car and the engine don&amp;#39;t start you get a mechanic. I fully understand that some people it&amp;#39;s not that easy, but try and seek it out help is there. I&amp;#39;m.in Ireland and I have the same fear you do not the thoughts as that is more individual to each of us, but the reasons it happens is all the same physically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when I started writing I had a pressure around my head not bad like just a gentle press like a jumper laying on it. I had a bit of shakes. And the huge thing is the feeling just below my rib cage like a liquid feeling. That is the adrenal gland where a lot comes from. I was sitting In my sitting room now I&amp;#39;m in car on my journey. Honestly I was nervous but typing this out for second time has distracted me so I&amp;#39;m chill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S they journey starts my nieces in the car are I&amp;#39;m.bad mood the are young 4 and 2ish. They want trolls soundtrack so I&amp;#39;m on spotify looking for the soundtrack. Was freaking a bit as the Wi-Fi wouldn&amp;#39;t cut off and go to mobile data and they where getting angry. Kids are not the greatest for logic. But good for me as put me into chaos situation and forces me to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So down to business I feel the adrenaline push into my stomach. And the start of the attack first I say OK let&amp;#39;s do this I feel my feet tingle and the air conditioner in the car feels colder than it is. My body is more sensitive to everything. My eyes are more focused and I&amp;#39;m at alert stations my thoughts are OK as I&amp;#39;m typing on this and I&amp;#39;m.focused on it more. The adrenalin will pass it might do another squirt but that&amp;#39;s OK too. All noises are super focused this is fight or flight I&amp;#39;m sensing a danger but it&amp;#39;s not there like its sucks but like its a good thing. If I was in danger I want my senses to be alert I don&amp;#39;t want to be getting chased and walking into walls. I feel like I must go to bathroom. And fear I won&amp;#39;t make it be embarrassed but fuck it don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m OK just looking for something to conform a fear response. I&amp;#39;m OK at the moment it&amp;#39;s like a 3 on panic scale no need for mindfulness but it is always a good thing for anyone to practice panic or no panic. I&amp;#39;m glued to my phone. I have a bottle of water a xanax ( always bring one but never used it to this day just comfort blanket) and pastel sweets with honey resume remedy they are called will link in comment all the stuff I&amp;#39;m talking about after. Just more focused on pushing past aniexty. I&amp;#39;m about to go into shopping centre next test. I&amp;#39;m like 8 miles from home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So new paragraph for shopping centre. Sister decides to go to top of car park always great that more walking. I never use lifts as the feeling uneases me so I use stairs thanks to my sister I get some extra exercise. Still feel the urge to use bathroom so I will I&amp;#39;m a bit dizzy. And sounds ambled up. SItting in chill area my knee are feeling weak and my constant about noise around me like Superman able to focus on them. And my breath gotta take a deep breath to just chill like a 5 on scale I also lost my sister so I&amp;#39;m afraid my neck is going mad loking left and right my legs are shaky when no stop and I feel off balance. I&amp;#39;m calmer now but still present just more chill. No where near what I was at I hate waiting around my sister is murder for looking at stuff and prolonging the stay I am more of get it done go home which we all are I think. So everything going great then my sister decides to change the plans now we at battle stations as per usual life throws a curve ball. We must wait for here father in law to give him something so my escape plans are fucked this messes me up. I&amp;#39;m grand thou I felt the Adeline enter my body and I started sweating like I just walked 2 miles and a headache is starting. I was at a 1 now I&amp;#39;m at a 6 with the new news I fell like shouting at my sister but that&amp;#39;s not going to help anything let&amp;#39;s just take it as another challenge. Worst things is texting someone on phone and they don&amp;#39;t respond that is huge trigger for me that few minutes it takes for them to respond. I quit smoking two years ago and moments like these his I just want one. But I know that was not helping me so I am sitting in resting area as my sister does more shopping. God I never expected to write this much sorry for that. So I&amp;#39;m sitting here focused on the phone typing and its working all the systems are at red alert but I&amp;#39;m like floating past them. Letting them take three course. It always passed and we always win. Deep breath in just let myself float and calmness is slowing taking over again. All the noises are lowering in volume headache still there thou. Just a better feeling of calm and excitement a high feeling of accomplishment. I was so focused on my anxiety I didn&amp;#39;t notice I was showing a plumbers bum I laughed mortified but at least something to laugh about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel it&amp;#39;s time for new paragraph as it looked messy. I&amp;#39;m. fine now just tired they take the energy out of you. I&amp;#39;m still in the shopping centre but I&amp;#39;m. good I&amp;#39;m OK now. It always passes. I love when I can separate myself and float it&amp;#39;s such a great feeling takes practice thou. I&amp;#39;m so sorry I wrote far too much. It&amp;#39;s helping me so much just to type it out. Nearly finished now panic is completely gone I might as well be at home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Found my sister and going home been eventful but win over all.

But it has truly been the thing to worsen my agoraphobia beyond compare, because I don&amp;#39;t have the structure of going to a public school which forces me to leave the house 5 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first real memory of having a panic attack was when I was in 8th grade. I was taking guitar lessons (which i really loved doing) at the time and at only my fourth lesson I felt so bad out of nowhere on the way there. Like all the sudden I felt hot and nauseous and light headed (but also like there was pressure in my head at the same time?) and my legs were shaking and I felt like I had to go to the bathroom and throw up all at once. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t stop shaking and while waiting for my actual lesson I kept having to get up and leave the store and walk around outside and come back like I couldn&amp;#39;t sit still and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop how I felt no matter what I did. I was so upset and sick the entire time of my actual lesson that I almost cried while apologizing to the instructor and telling him that I didn&amp;#39;t feel well, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it was cut short because I was obviously unwell at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt humiliated, my brother was with me and he was annoyed that i was &amp;quot;making a show&amp;quot; and my mom compared me to a young girl who was getting lessons because she was younger than me and doing just fine while i on the other hand looked like i was gonna throw up or have a heart attack or maybe both. I know it&amp;#39;s not their fault, they didn&amp;#39;t know why i was acting like that and I didn&amp;#39;t up until a while after, but it was beyond terrifying and humiliating and of course, I never went back because I was too embarrassed. But as soon as I left and got into the car to go home? I felt better, extremely exhausted and worn out, but it was like as soon as I knew I was on my way home it went away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started feeling like that in more and more instances, and in a much more heightened way. I spent months at a time not leaving the house, and avoided doing so at all costs. It&amp;#39;s like I was so terrified of feeling that way again that all I did was make myself the way that I am now. I started getting panic attacks in the middle of the night or when I was on the verge of falling asleep, in the comfort of my own home!! and ALWAYS before going out no matter how much I wanted to go. Because I have trouble with my thyroid I have to go to doctor&amp;#39;s often so they can check how I&amp;#39;m doing, and every time I had to go it was an argument, my parents were frustrated because they assumed I just didn&amp;#39;t like the doctor&amp;#39;s or that I was being childish and having a tantrum, but it isn&amp;#39;t that I don&amp;#39;t want to go to the doctor&amp;#39;s. I couldn&amp;#39;t even explain it because there wasn&amp;#39;t, and still isn&amp;#39;t, anything to explain or any real reason for why I have these panic attacks, I&amp;#39;m just so scared because of them- i&amp;#39;m scared of everything, but everything i&amp;#39;m scared of is just so stupid (like, dark clouds of all things? even if there&amp;#39;s a minimal chance of rain? come on). I cant pinpoint why I feel the way I do anymore. Everything in my life since 8th grade that I&amp;#39;ve missed out on has been for fear of having a panic attack and every time i try to do something i just completely fall apart again and it just reinforces that idea that I can&amp;#39;t do anything without having one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the whole reason I&amp;#39;m typing this out now is because I&amp;#39;m at my wits end, I&amp;#39;m crying at my desk right now because i KNOW all i&amp;#39;m doing anymore is ruining any chances I have at having a normal life. I feel pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to therapists/psychiatrists and have been told the same things (breathing exercises.. what am I supposed to do when they only make me feel MORE nauseous during an attack.) and have been given pills for depression, anxiety, etc, have been given xanax (which was the only thing that actually worked, but we moved and I ran out and don&amp;#39;t even know if I can have someone prescribe it to me here.) But it&amp;#39;s also difficult to get yourself to one when 3/4&amp;#39;s of the time you&amp;#39;re terrified of leaving the house and feeling like you&amp;#39;re going to vomit at the thought of doing so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents are more understanding now, but they don&amp;#39;t know what to do either because they don&amp;#39;t fully understand it, and I can&amp;#39;t expect them to, but at least sometimes they&amp;#39;re able to see that I&amp;#39;m trying. I have no one to go to when I&amp;#39;m like this because I&amp;#39;m beyond terrified of embarrassing myself or annoying a person by talking about it to them. I cant go on trips, or go to stores without having to plan how I&amp;#39;m feeling or what the weather&amp;#39;s going to be like or what time i&amp;#39;m going to wake up at because I don&amp;#39;t want to give myself too much time to think before I go because I know that it&amp;#39;ll just trigger an attack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that this is a board for people who have the same issues as I do, but even here I still feel like no matter how I put it into words, i just can&amp;#39;t explain the extent of how bad it is, or how bad I feel, or how absolutely hopeless I feel, or maybe people will think that i&amp;#39;m faking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t applied to college because I thought I could take a year off to figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing and try to get a job, but how am I supposed to go to a job everyday if I can&amp;#39;t even go up the street to buy a soda at a mini-mart without being terrified for reasons /I/ don&amp;#39;t even know? I&amp;#39;ve pushed down helping myself for so long that now I feel like it&amp;#39;s too late. It&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve forced myself to grow into this mold because of all my fears and doubts and now no matter how hard i try or push myself i just can&amp;#39;t break it and live my life like i want to. I can&amp;#39;t blame my parents for not realizing someone was wrong, the only one I can blame is myself. It really is all my fault and I just want it to stop. I don&amp;#39;t even think i&amp;#39;ve seen someone my age who has this, and while i know they&amp;#39;re out there, i still feel like such an idiot and like im wasting my youth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I have the opportunity to do something really amazing this summer with a friend I know online. It&amp;#39;s something I want to do so badly and is (pretty much) a once in a lifetime opportunity, but not only is it a three day trip where I have to take a plane there and back, but it&amp;#39;s so many of my fears wrapped into one, a long day OUTSIDE all day in the suffocating humid summer heat with large crowds, and lots of stimuli and I&amp;#39;ll be so far away from home, hanging out with someone I genuinely like but also someone who I&amp;#39;m terrified of making a fool of myself in front of if I have a panic attack, because while i know that they&amp;#39;d feel bad and try their best to help me, i also know that if i&amp;#39;ll be so embarrassed to talk to them again with how messy my panic attacks usually are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I said that I&amp;#39;m going (at first i was so 100% sure of myself, and that surely I wouldn&amp;#39;t let myself miss this- and thought that &amp;quot;hey! if i do this it&amp;#39;ll surely stop me from having panic attacks anymore- i&amp;#39;ll be able to do anything!&amp;quot;) I&amp;#39;ve been having attacks almost every day out of nowhere that last for so long, or i&amp;#39;ll think about it and end up having attacks that way.

I\u2019m hoping that it will manage to help someone out there:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My earliest recollections with anxiety started in Elementary school, if not sooner. Home was my safe space, where I could express myself to my family with minimal recrimination. The problem was that it was my only safe place. Leaving for school, family outings, or long trips caused instant anxiety \u2013 especially since my parents always made a big spectacle of things which drew attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to fight them tooth and nail on anything that involved leaving the house. These were older days, when many people didn\u2019t understand psychological issues. They didn\u2019t know why I was deathly afraid to go out, or couldn\u2019t handle tense situations. I didn\u2019t have the words to explain, either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The anxiety usually manifested as stomach pain. It got to the point my parents thought I had IBS. Long trips were a disaster, as I frequently had to use the bathroom. I remember my first panic attack in 5th grade. I had extreme test anxiety, and math was a special demon. I ran to the teacher, beginning to cry, and asked to go to the bathroom. Bathrooms became my new safe place. I couldn\u2019t even leave the stall until my Mom came to pick me up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I escaped into online gaming. There I was able to become someone else who was confident. I developed an online persona and could socialize through text. It probably wasn\u2019t totally healthy, but I could grow in some small way as a person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I got older and the hormones hit, things only got worse. Bullying was \u201cnormal,\u201d but even if a person looked at me I felt targeted. A person across the room laughing was laughing at my flaws. A simple \u201cHello\u201d from someone lit my face red. Trying to talk resulted in every thought leaving my head. My neck would jerk when holding eye contact. I would constantly flee to the relative safety of a bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By 9th grade the act of boarding a bus started a panic attack. On entering the school, the combined smells of the gym, horrible cafeteria food, chlorine from the pool, and so many kids packed together threw me into a full blown panic attack. I decided to be homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I got to senior year, I made the push to go back to school. I figured that if people were going to look at me and judge me, I would show them something I could control. I joined that \u201cdifferent\u201d group in school. At the time the most prominent were the goths. If people were going to look at me it would be because of my wild hair, or my outlandish clothes. It helped me to finally graduate High school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After school I figured I would try University. Everyone said it was supposed to be easier, and more flexible to work with. I made my own schedule and tried to work around my anxiety. A jacket provided an extra layer of protection against people. Headphones let me ignore what people were saying, and I avoided eye contact altogether. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I sought therapy and found the words to express my problems. I kicked the IBS anxiety with a more strict diet. Then I developed an issue with sweating. Whenever I got anxiety I started to sweat, it turned into a negative feedback loop if people saw it. Then the sweating only got worse. I had to stuff tissues in my armpits just on the commute to University (I avoided dorms completely). I took a two hour trip to see a friend, my first long drive by myself. By the time I got there I was soaked and shaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I met my best friend. She had the same kinds of anxieties as me. She introduced me to pot, which curbed the anxiety. It was always a toss-up, though, on whether it would just increase my paranoia (same with alcohol). But, through her I was able to go to a mall again. Being with someone I was comfortable with deflected some of the stares. I was no longer getting 100% of the attention, instead it was 50% and I could almost function. She also introduced me to her friends, and I could socialize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I joined the gym because I had body image issues which furthered my anxiety. If I was going to be sweating in public, I may as well go to a place where it is socially acceptable. My headphones and hoodie didn\u2019t even cause people to bat an eye. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was there that I learned a truth about social settings. It took me a long time to realize, but the vast majority of people only care about their own situations. The look people gave me was just a look. The laughter across the room wasn\u2019t directed at me. They\u2019re more focused on their own issues, like losing weight or the bills they have to pay. Sure, there was still the occasional judgmental jock or condescending teen. But most people are in the same boat of not liking those types, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of my hard work finally paid off when I graduated University. It took me years longer than other students, because I was taking less classes at a time. Luckily they had an in absentia option, so I could avoid the ceremony itself. But afterwards, my best friend and I had a falling out. Thus began the dark years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best friend was gone, and I had no other friends. It was hard for me to branch out to new people. I was desperately looking for work, but it was so much harder with agoraphobia. For years all I did was stay in my parents\u2019 house, and go back and forth to the gym. I stayed up until 4am and woke at almost noon. My life completely stopped and I could barely function. I was drowning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through force of will I went on job interviews to break the monotony. Through sheer luck I managed to get a job in my field. It was part-time and the hours were flexible. I was able to slowly integrate myself into work. My body image issues were gone. I still had anxiety but by exercising I could exhaust myself, and get through it. My job offered me full-time, and I took it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With my life in order, I needed a way to reach out for new people/friends. I started to date. The agoraphobia prohibited me from doing certain things, but for the most part I could \u201cfake\u201d it so I could be out in public. My limit was about two days in a row before I needed some serious alone time to recover. Each relationship ended for different reasons, but I had a normal dating life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally met someone who I was with for four months. In the third month I opened up about my anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia. He seemed very into me, and he came across as very accepting. I told him that going out too much could cause a panic attack. Then came the weekend of Hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I went to his house I forgot my anxiety medication, but I hadn\u2019t been needing it and felt I was ok. On Friday we went to see a play. On Saturday we went out shopping and to dinner. On Sunday night he had a party at his place with around ten friends. I was having a good time getting to know people and playing games. We were drinking and the night kept going. At some point he was entertaining people and I became isolated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to have a panic attack. Normally I would flee to the safety of my parents\u2019 house. But I was drinking, I couldn\u2019t drive. I was trapped. I started to disassociate from the people around me. They weren\u2019t the people I was becoming friends with. Their stares turned accusing, their laughter mocking, their body language threatening. I quietly fled to his bedroom, and the attached bathroom. There I broke down and began sobbing hysterically. After a while he found me in the bathroom. I hugged him tight but he had no idea what to do or what was going on. I started saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d over and over again. I was sweating and crying and apologizing as the fear took hold of me and I was trapped in a cage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I calmed down enough that he went back to the party, I managed to fall asleep and avoided his friends finding out about it. At 3am I woke up again. I was still slightly intoxicated. I was still having a panic attack. He was asleep next to me, not touching me or comforting me. I started disassociating from him too. At 3am I snuck out of his house, and fled to my own. The next day my worst fears came true, he couldn\u2019t handle my anxiety, he broke up with me\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a terrible experience. It took me months to get over. But I\u2019m stronger than that. I refuse to give up hope that there is a guy out there who can understand. One that will work with me, understand my anxiety, comfort me when I\u2019m at my worst, and show compassion. Just like I will try to be there for that person when they need me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep on fighting because I am a warrior. Now I can go to work, I can go grocery shopping, I can date. Just like all of us with agoraphobia can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the act of putting on a jacket, we don our armor. Our headphones are our shield. Our words and body language are our weapons. Every day we fight an unseen battle. Just like any battle, we will make mistakes. We will be injured, we will collect scars, we will sweat and the fear and adrenaline will overwhelm us. Some of us might develop PTSD from the horrors we have seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like any warrior we have to train. We have to go out and use our weapons. We have to fight many smaller battles so that we can take on the next bigger battle. We have to win the war. Because to give in to the fear, is to not exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to know, is that we are not alone out there. We are an army. We are in the eyes of a child hiding behind his mom in the grocery store. The man who wears sunglasses, a ball cap, and a hoodie indoors in the summer. And the girl who stutters but continues to read in the front of the class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I have agoraphobia, but I fight it every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forgive me if I don\u2019t respond much. It took a lot to write this and reading the responses could be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been a lurker here for a while now.

In the third month I opened up about my anxiety, panic attacks, and agoraphobia. He seemed very into me, and he came across as very accepting. I told him that going out too much could cause a panic attack. Then came the weekend of Hell.\n\nWhen I went to his house I forgot my anxiety medication, but I hadn\u2019t been needing it and felt I was ok. On Friday we went to see a play. On Saturday we went out shopping and to dinner. On Sunday night he had a party at his place with around ten friends. I was having a good time getting to know people and playing games. We were drinking and the night kept going. At some point he was entertaining people and I became isolated.\n\nI started to have a panic attack. Normally I would flee to the safety of my parents\u2019 house. But I was drinking, I couldn\u2019t drive. I was trapped. I started to disassociate from the people around me. They weren\u2019t the people I was becoming friends with. Their stares turned accusing, their laughter mocking, their body language threatening. I quietly fled to his bedroom, and the attached bathroom. There I broke down and began sobbing hysterically. After a while he found me in the bathroom. I hugged him tight but he had no idea what to do or what was going on. I started saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d over and over again. I was sweating and crying and apologizing as the fear took hold of me and I was trapped in a cage. \n\nEventually I calmed down enough that he went back to the party, I managed to fall asleep and avoided his friends finding out about it. At 3am I woke up again. I was still slightly intoxicated. I was still having a panic attack. He was asleep next to me, not touching me or comforting me. I started disassociating from him too. At 3am I snuck out of his house, and fled to my own. The next day my worst fears came true, he couldn\u2019t handle my anxiety, he broke up with me\u2026\n\n It was a terrible experience. It took me months to get over. But I\u2019m stronger than that. I refuse to give up hope that there is a guy out there who can understand. One that will work with me, understand my anxiety, comfort me when I\u2019m at my worst, and show compassion. Just like I will try to be there for that person when they need me. \n\nI keep on fighting because I am a warrior. Now I can go to work, I can go grocery shopping, I can date. Just like all of us with agoraphobia can.\n\nWith the act of putting on a jacket, we don our armor. Our headphones are our shield. Our words and body language are our weapons. Every day we fight an unseen battle. Just like any battle, we will make mistakes. We will be injured, we will collect scars, we will sweat and the fear and adrenaline will overwhelm us. Some of us might develop PTSD from the horrors we have seen.\n\nLike any warrior we have to train. We have to go out and use our weapons. We have to fight many smaller battles so that we can take on the next bigger battle. We have to win the war. Because to give in to the fear, is to not exist at all.\n\nThe most important thing to know, is that we are not alone out there. We are an army. We are in the eyes of a child hiding behind his mom in the grocery store. The man who wears sunglasses, a ball cap, and a hoodie indoors in the summer. And the girl who stutters but continues to read in the front of the class.\n\nTL;DR: I have agoraphobia, but I fight it every day.\n\nForgive me if I don\u2019t respond much. It took a lot to write this and reading the responses could be overwhelming.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6cqr0h", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My phantasmagoria of agoraphobia", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6cqr0h", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/6cqr0h/my_phantasmagoria_of_agoraphobia/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1495522742.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/6cqr0h/my_phantasmagoria_of_agoraphobia/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Acksulottle-Awnree", "created_utc": 1495493942.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, aka &amp;#39;streaM Freak&amp;#39; here,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interested or have a Psychological Dysfunction?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are currently at about 640+ users, of disordered and non disordered individuals.

Firehouses have been a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem for me these past couple years.

I know it&amp;#39;s risky pouring my heart onto the internet... but I&amp;#39;ve been visiting this site a lot lately, and I&amp;#39;ve seen many positive comments.. And every time I try talking to anyone, I keep being told, &amp;quot;things could always be worse!&amp;quot; which is NOT comforting at all. My diagnoses include agoraphobia, depression, bipolar 2, anxiety, and trichotillomania (I&amp;#39;m losing my hair to an impulse-control disorder). I apologize for this long, rambling post.. I haven&amp;#39;t slept in days since I&amp;#39;m going through withdrawal after 2 years of 300 mg/day Seroquel. Worst withdrawal ever!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little background info.. I&amp;#39;m a 28 year old female and I left my hometown (a &amp;quot;big city&amp;quot; in a conservative southern state) a little over six years ago and moved back four months ago. I was very hesitant to move back, but my boyfriend in Connecticut convinced me I&amp;#39;ll be better off to be closer to family and we&amp;#39;ll still see each other... immediately after he changed his mind about me moving in with him. He has a successful company in Louisiana, so that&amp;#39;s how we were together last year. When he didn&amp;#39;t need to spend as much time there, he sold his Louisiana house and settled back into his main house.  Now we&amp;#39;re in different states. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stupidly thought we would stay together long-distance, as he said he wanted to, and we had many plans this year. But as it turns out, this was his way of getting rid of me. I am feeling heartbroken, but this brings new problems on top of it. He has been supporting me financially, and promised to for as long as I need him, but I know I am soon to be cut off. This is after spending pretty much all of my money on the expensive move and stupid fucking furniture I regret buying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some in savings, but not nearly as much as I could have if I stayed in Louisiana. I am soon to be broke again, due to my own stupidity and bad spending problems. I am not trying to blame anyone but myself, and I know I could have done much better. Well, I guess I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; again but it doesn&amp;#39;t feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I dropped out of university in the beginning of my second semester, since I was extremely uncomfortable and overwhelmed by the hundreds of students I had to see every day. I was largely uninformed about college and had no idea I could have started at a smaller school first. So I just stopped going one day. I never even knew about the concept of dropping classes early to avoid a &amp;quot;W,&amp;quot; my professors never withdrew me, so I accumulated multiple Fs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to being a college drop-out with a terrible transcript and various other circumstances, I have been largely confined to the sex industry since I was 20.\nI&amp;#39;ve never had a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; job for more than a few months, except my first job at a fading &amp;quot;breastaurant&amp;quot; chain when I was 18, for a couple of years. All of the other menial customer service jobs I&amp;#39;ve tried since then have ended terribly. I just could not keep up with my coworkers or deal with getting yelled at by rude customers, so I panicked constantly.. \nNothing I&amp;#39;m qualified for pays over $10/hr... which I made at a hotel while living in Section 8 housing, taking the bus to work, and still unable to pay bills. I busted my ass at work too, as being understaffed is so commonplace now. To me, this seemed equally as degrading as sex work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the recession started, my roommate convinced me to try stripping.. This has been a catalyst for my alcohol abuse over the past 10 years. And then that money dried up, and I have mostly been a prostitute in various environments (clubs, brothels, agencies, independent escorting, etc). I have had both good and bad experiences, but it wasn&amp;#39;t always terrible. I hate to admit this, but I&amp;#39;ve always had to rely on my appearance to keep surviving. I have seriously failed every other job I&amp;#39;ve attempted, so I know it&amp;#39;s inevitable I will be back. Again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since moving back home, it has not been easy. Every place I used to visit has been shuttered, my best friend has died of an overdose, and I realized my family (besides parents a few hours away) doesn&amp;#39;t really give a fuck about me. My sister, who I used to see all the time before I moved, has only contacted me to borrow my car for a month or to petsit for her. I had to actually ask for it back, even though her vehicle had already been fixed for a while... and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from her since.. Now I feel I&amp;#39;ve lost both my boyfriend and my sister in my life now. \nThe rest of my old friends here have since moved on, started families, and don&amp;#39;t seem too interested in seeing me. I might as well have moved to another country, but this feels worse somehow. Like my home is no longer home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just got accepted into the university I wanted to, so I know I should be happy. On the rare occasions I leave the house (usually once every other week), people tell me I should be happy. I really love the school I chose, but I still don&amp;#39;t know if moving back has been worth it, as much as it has cost. The money I could have saved is a constant regret I cannot stop thinking about, since coming home wasn&amp;#39;t what I expected. I guess I don&amp;#39;t know what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been out only one night since moving back.. About five weeks ago. One night in four months, the rest spent inside. Well, alcohol is a very effective anti-anxiety drug, and I should have been more careful. The afternoon started out okay, and I met some nice people.. Thought I might have finally made some new friends.. And then I woke up in an ambulance.. \nI had tripped and fell, slamming my face onto concrete.. I had a concussion, broken nose, and busted lip down all the down to my chin, now marked haywire with stitches. My only &amp;quot;fun night out&amp;quot; ended in the ER before it even started. Now that I know I&amp;#39;m such a fuck-up when I go out, this pushed me even further inside. My home feels like a prison, while I involuntarily put myself on house arrest. I cannot forgive myself for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know my accident could have been much worse! This is what everyone tells me! ...but honestly, this is the worst advice you can give to a depressed person. Telling me things can actually get worse just makes me want to die even more. My face is now marked with ugly scars, which is not good when I need to stay pretty in order to survive. My mom kept telling me how &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; I am that I didn&amp;#39;t land on my temple and die, but part of me secretly wishes that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then things did get worse. I received an $18,000 medical bill... despite paying a huge premium every month for a so-called &amp;quot;premier insurance plan&amp;quot; with a mere $600 ER copay (LIES!). I paid for the best plan I could get and still got denied coverage. And three more bills have arrived in the mail. What will happen next? \nOh right, and I also need my wisdom teeth out now! More medical bills, yay! Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to die many times before, but my dog has kept me alive. Due to my reclusiveness, I&amp;#39;m worried that I will be dead for weeks before anyone finds me... then my baby will be left with no one to take care of her until then. She is nine now, and I know if anything happens to her, it could literally kill me. Humans always fail me, but she has been the my most constant source of love in my life, which I don&amp;#39;t find often. I need her, but I know she is getting old. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;School starts on the 1st next month, and I&amp;#39;m hoping I will be okay. I have not driven a car in over two months, nor can I sleep over four hours per night. I am constantly anxious and it&amp;#39;s a horrible feeling. I&amp;#39;ve also been unable to eat, so I lost 20 pounds in a month... which was cool, but I feel incredibly weak so I&amp;#39;m forcing myself to eat now.  I hope the withdrawal ends before school starts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if anyone actually reads some or all of this, thank you. Sorry to tell my long crappy life story, but I suppose I have plenty of time inside to do so. I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m trying to get out of this, but I just need someone to talk to. I felt that sharing how agoraphobia got to take over my life was necessary, despite lots of details. And I hope I followed proper Reddiquette procedures. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have a good night, or day, wherever you are reading from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Changed some potentially identifying information &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I just joined Reddit today, so I can post about this, since I don't really have anyone in my life to talk to. I know it's risky pouring my heart onto the internet... but I've been visiting this site a lot lately, and I've seen many positive comments.. And every time I try talking to anyone, I keep being told, \"things could always be worse!\" which is NOT comforting at all. My diagnoses include agoraphobia, depression, bipolar 2, anxiety, and trichotillomania (I'm losing my hair to an impulse-control disorder). I apologize for this long, rambling post.. I haven't slept in days since I'm going through withdrawal after 2 years of 300 mg/day Seroquel. Worst withdrawal ever!!\n\nA little background info.. I'm a 28 year old female and I left my hometown (a \"big city\" in a conservative southern state) a little over six years ago and moved back four months ago. I was very hesitant to move back, but my boyfriend in Connecticut convinced me I'll be better off to be closer to family and we'll still see each other... immediately after he changed his mind about me moving in with him. He has a successful company in Louisiana, so that's how we were together last year. When he didn't need to spend as much time there, he sold his Louisiana house and settled back into his main house.  Now we're in different states. \n\nI stupidly thought we would stay together long-distance, as he said he wanted to, and we had many plans this year. But as it turns out, this was his way of getting rid of me. I am feeling heartbroken, but this brings new problems on top of it. He has been supporting me financially, and promised to for as long as I need him, but I know I am soon to be cut off. This is after spending pretty much all of my money on the expensive move and stupid fucking furniture I regret buying.\n\nI have some in savings, but not nearly as much as I could have if I stayed in Louisiana. I am soon to be broke again, due to my own stupidity and bad spending problems. I am not trying to blame anyone but myself, and I know I could have done much better. Well, I guess I'm \"home\" again but it doesn't feel that way.\n\nSeven years ago, I dropped out of university in the beginning of my second semester, since I was extremely uncomfortable and overwhelmed by the hundreds of students I had to see every day. I was largely uninformed about college and had no idea I could have started at a smaller school first. So I just stopped going one day. I never even knew about the concept of dropping classes early to avoid a \"W,\" my professors never withdrew me, so I accumulated multiple Fs. \n\nDue to being a college drop-out with a terrible transcript and various other circumstances, I have been largely confined to the sex industry since I was 20.\nI've never had a \"normal\" job for more than a few months, except my first job at a fading \"breastaurant\" chain when I was 18, for a couple of years. All of the other menial customer service jobs I've tried since then have ended terribly. I just could not keep up with my coworkers or deal with getting yelled at by rude customers, so I panicked constantly.. \nNothing I'm qualified for pays over $10/hr... which I made at a hotel while living in Section 8 housing, taking the bus to work, and still unable to pay bills. I busted my ass at work too, as being understaffed is so commonplace now. To me, this seemed equally as degrading as sex work.\n\nWhen the recession started, my roommate convinced me to try stripping.. This has been a catalyst for my alcohol abuse over the past 10 years. And then that money dried up, and I have mostly been a prostitute in various environments (clubs, brothels, agencies, independent escorting, etc). I have had both good and bad experiences, but it wasn't always terrible. I hate to admit this, but I've always had to rely on my appearance to keep surviving. I have seriously failed every other job I've attempted, so I know it's inevitable I will be back. Again.\n\nSince moving back home, it has not been easy. Every place I used to visit has been shuttered, my best friend has died of an overdose, and I realized my family (besides parents a few hours away) doesn't really give a fuck about me. My sister, who I used to see all the time before I moved, has only contacted me to borrow my car for a month or to petsit for her. I had to actually ask for it back, even though her vehicle had already been fixed for a while... and I haven't heard from her since.. Now I feel I've lost both my boyfriend and my sister in my life now. \nThe rest of my old friends here have since moved on, started families, and don't seem too interested in seeing me. I might as well have moved to another country, but this feels worse somehow. Like my home is no longer home.\n\nI just got accepted into the university I wanted to, so I know I should be happy. On the rare occasions I leave the house (usually once every other week), people tell me I should be happy. I really love the school I chose, but I still don't know if moving back has been worth it, as much as it has cost. The money I could have saved is a constant regret I cannot stop thinking about, since coming home wasn't what I expected. I guess I don't know what I expected.\n\nI have been out only one night since moving back.. About five weeks ago. One night in four months, the rest spent inside.

So I envisioned myself there at meditation and my dear greatly diminished; the environment became less \"threatening\" and I was able to relax. \n\nPS: I have had a rough week. Couldn't get my wisdom tooth taken out because Nova Cain shots triggered my PTSD. I let it ruin almost my entire day yesterday but I turned it around. I'm going to figure something out though. One can hope, right? This party gave me hope! :) (Being able to chill with some of my favorite people didn't hurt either.) :) \n\n**TL;DR:** In spite of a kind of shitty year life is good! :-D &lt;3", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "68efam", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Went to a busy art show party.

Some good, some very bad. Something that was suggested to help my developing agoraphobia was to move to a new area, new house, apartment, some where new. He said that living in the house that I grew up in would hinder me to do old habits I had as a kid. Well me and my boyfriend made it an effort to do that. His mom had the income for us to move up to her and live near her in our own apartment and have our own responsibilities. We took the opportunity to see if moving would actually help me move on. It&amp;#39;s been 2 months now since we moved here and I can say I 100% got worse.

I don&amp;#39;t do chores, I let myself go a lot and can barely keep a decent conversation with my boyfriend. I look to my computer for comfort and I play games all day to release the anxiety and stay away from it. Everytime I am taken away from it or my boyfriend gets upset that I am not doing anything I break down, feel guilty, miserable, and even want to cry. Even with the psychologist telling me what I need to do to help myself it never seems to work and I always revert to old ways.

Anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety was so bad that I felt intense derealization: everything felt surreal, like then world around me wasn&amp;#39;t real and I would float away and disappear if I stepped foot outside. I couldn&amp;#39;t go to therapy because I couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere let alone drive. I lost my therapist because nobody there understood why I was having to cancel appointments. I felt like my life was over and it was hopeless to keep trying. I just stayed inside and didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere for days, weeks and months on end. I was miserable. So depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized something had to change because even though i felt suicidal every single day, I didn&amp;#39;t really want die. I just wanted to feel better. I couldn&amp;#39;t do that to my loving and darling husband, and my super caring parents, sister, fun loving 10 year old niece and friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forced myself to get on new medication. I started Sertraline (Zoloft) at 25 mlg. My husband at one point learned I was taking it at night which was keeping me up so I started taking it during the day (what a difference!) I started feeling better. More in my body. Mind less cluttered. Less like I could disappear at any second or that my life wasn&amp;#39;t worth living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it was really bad I started forcing myself to go out on the roof of my apartment where you can chill and watch the world go by. Its quite nice up there. I have a chair I can comfortably recline on and enjoy the view. I can even see the Hudson River.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I started to feel brave enough to go out on the street at night. I went for a quick walk around my block and didn&amp;#39;t panic. This was encouraging so I started over an expanded period of time to force myself to cross the street. At first this was hard as I imagined myself collapsing from anxiety and passing out in the middle of the street if I felt light headed. But---lo and behold- that\u2019s never happened!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time was able to cross the street and that fear has slowly gone away. I felt successful even though I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere at first. But gradually I did start going inside places. I walked by myself a block and a half to the corner deli and was able to get myself a snack for the first time in a year- VICTORY! For awhile I practiced doing this, and over time I got stronger. I was soon able to visit my older friend who runs a little art gallery/shop in town. That helped because it was someone familiar. Then I traveled a bit out of my immediate comfort zone to the coffee house which is conveniently across the street from her. Before that, I went with my husband for a walk to my favorite bookstore which is right behind our building on the street behind ours, and that was like a breath of fresh air!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband is great at rewarding me when I do stuff I\u2019m scared of. He will treat me to food, and that day we went to the bookstore he bought me a beautiful gorgeous dreamcatcher that was hanging in the window. :) He is such a sweetheart and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get through this if it weren\u2019t for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today things are much easier. I can go to a dentist appointment by myself. I can sit with friends at the coffee shop on my own. I can stand in line and get something to eat. I can even go out to dinner with my husband and not feel like I am suffocating from the fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The anxiety and depression is by no means gone entirely but today I am getting back to doing things that I love. I even went for a walk with my mom down by the riverfront when she came for a surprise visit from Colorado. It was amazing. Things like this I don\u2019t ever take for granted; things like standing by a peaceful stream, and being able to feel connected to Nature. When I can do that it\u2019s a feeling that I don\u2019t ever want to end. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What helped me? For one thing the meds. I notice a definite difference and am now at 100 mgs. Another thing: the \u201cgrounding\u201d technique: keeping yourself centered so you can feel connected to the Earth and more in your body (not that floaty, dissatached \u201cderealization\u201d feeling that scares me). When out, i would wear headphones and play calming music (don\u2019t need that now); I would touch solid objects (like trees and parking meters, the sides of buildings, ect.) I would give myself goals to reach (i.e. today it\u2019s the second parking meter, tomorrow it\u2019s the garbage can- weird I know but it works, at least it has for me!). I would treat myself when I reached my destination. I still do. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In December, I challenged myself to spend Christmas Eve at my sister\u2019s place, which is in the next town, the same one I grew up in, 15 minutes away, so that I could visit with her and my niece and my sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2026.specifically so that I could be with my niece, who\u2019s 10, on Christmas Morning. I was able to ride in the car for a trial run a week before-- I was fine, no panic. :) I was able to go on Christmas Eve (we went at night so it was easier) and it was a lovely time! Only thing was I did have a panic attack in the morning a bit but eventually calmed down and was able to enjoy the presents exchange. :) (That was fun!) AND I was able to ride back in the car DURING the day (my sis\u2019s boyfriend drove us, he is a great driver, plus he let me barrow his sunglasses, which helped.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best part of Christmas?

I&amp;#39;ve had panic attacks in all of my classes at least once, have had to call my mom to drive 30 minutes to meet me, hiding in my room and not telling my roommates what&amp;#39;s going on because it&amp;#39;s so embarrassing, and feeling really uneasy going out in public. Everything is a huge struggle for me. I finally decided to make an appointment with a therapist a couple months ago. It went well and she gave me some good tips and reassured me that I would be able to overcome this. I had two panic attack free weeks (a rarity!) and was feeling pretty good. I was even able to go to parties and my classes and do normal things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one day felt a weird feeling come over me out the blue, kind of like &amp;quot;chills&amp;quot; in my head. I had the thought that maybe I was having strokes/seizures instead of panic attacks and had to take a xanax. Then a few days later, as I was walking to a class I felt like my legs were about to stop working or gravity was pressing down on me. I had the most awful panic attack of my entire life; I literally ended up curled up in the fetal position on the floor of a bathroom stall in the school library, convinced that I was actually dying and these were my final moments. Ever since then, going out is even more terrifying to me. I know now with certainty that I am not actually dying or having a heart attack or seizure during a panic attack--but what I am scared of is simply having an attack. I&amp;#39;ve felt absolute terror and I&amp;#39;m so scared of feeling it again, or feeling it when I&amp;#39;m with someone who won&amp;#39;t understand what I&amp;#39;m going through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the semester going easier on myself, pushing myself to get out of the house once a day, which didn&amp;#39;t always happen. I forced myself to deal with the anxiety and only took xanax once or twice a week when I was having a full blown anxiety attack. But I always felt on the edge of an attack. I felt jumpy, uneasy, and like there was electricity buzzing through my body. I would have moments where I felt good, or normal again, but they wouldn&amp;#39;t last and overall I was really nonfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a week ago I went out with some friends for ice cream. It was at night and about a mile (I think) walk from my house, so I was really pushing myself. But I thought I could do it and that it would help me a lot to do something like that and know that I&amp;#39;m fine. Well, as we were waiting outside in a line for ice cream, I started to get intense derealization. It felt like I was stoned out of my mind. Like I wasn&amp;#39;t really there at all and was barely conscious. The very feeling of existence felt alien, bizarre, and unreal. I was so terrified that I would collapse onto the ground and lose consciousness. Instead I just powered through it, got serious heart palpitations on the way home, didn&amp;#39;t enjoy my ice cream much because of it, had to take a xanax when I got back, and then called my parents to take me back home for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, I actually felt pretty decent. I was able to eat at a restaurant with my boyfriend without panicking (although we did sit by the entrance which made me feel better). But the following morning I had another bad panic attack. I decided to finally start taking Lexapro that I was prescribed about a month ago by my doctor. This was a week ago. Already on the first day, I felt like my mind had calmed just a bit and I felt more &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. I decided to take a week off from school just in case I had bad side effects, and to give myself a break from the extreme stress. I was doing a lot better until I had a hair appointment a few days ago, and randomly got a really bad panic attack, one of the worst I&amp;#39;ve ever had. I felt out of control of myself, muscles were twitching, I was trembling really hard, mouth and throat completely dried up, couldn&amp;#39;t stop fidgeting, and felt close to getting up out of my chair and running outside. It eventually died down and I took a small amount of xanax and felt better, but it was really disappointing to see that Lexapro didn&amp;#39;t prevent that from happening. I know it can take a couple months for you to really feel all the effects of an SSRI, but I don&amp;#39;t really feel like I have that time because I need to get back to school now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I feel terrified of going out of my parent&amp;#39;s house and I&amp;#39;m worried that I will never overcome this. It&amp;#39;s crazy because only half a year ago, I didn&amp;#39;t experience agoraphobia at all. I had panic attacks but none of it was ever this bad. I want so badly to feel like myself again. Every time I have hope that I&amp;#39;m returning to that, a panic attack comes and the agoraphobia gets stronger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really sure what the point of this is, but I hope someone can relate and if anyone has words of encouragement or advice it would be really appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Can anyone else relate?

The longer it went on, the scarier it became, and the more my life became a dependent, miserable one which then got my courage to below zero. \n\nI feel for you guys so much and wish you all the best, but I would like to know your particular experiences and why exposure hasn't worked, or if you have tried it, and if not, why?

As I count, I feel myself calming down and then the attack is usually over by the time I walk through the front door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to people.

I\u2019ve found that if I don\u2019t leave the house and ride my bicycle, my agoraphobia always gets worse when I leave the next day.

This works very well when I\u2019m in a car or bus. I usually talk to someone, listen to music, or read a book. These activities help me to forget about the ongoing dread and panic. Sometimes, it works better than it does at other times and it doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take your medicine daily. I\u2019ve mentioned before that I take an herbal supplement called 5-HTP twice a day. Sometimes, I forget to take it because I think I don\u2019t need it. However, I have to.

It started with me preferring to stay at home, which gradually morphed into a sense of dread when I had obligations or appointments. From there, over the past year or two, it turned into me having panic attacks and anxiety whenever I had to leave the house. And from there it&amp;#39;s only getting worse, as I am prone to suffer from horrid anxiety days before I have plans outside. It&amp;#39;s now leading me to not be able to do things I love previously like going to concerts and is making me miss appointments.\nI do relatively fine outside sometimes, but do not cope well with being in vehicles or in large areas or areas with a condensed large amount of people. I&amp;#39;m now realizing that being around a lot of strangers is my main trigger for me, rather than just the simple prospect of being outside of my house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in therapy now, and surprisingly being in my therapist&amp;#39;s office is one of the few places where I feel at ease. We&amp;#39;ve made a lot of progress, but she strongly advised that I be prescribed a benzo to take as needed to prevent me from missing obligations and to help me keep my head clear in panic situations so I can rationalize through my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started seeing a new doctor about this and was given gabapentin. It did help with anxiety, but problem was I couldn&amp;#39;t take it during the day when I most needed it because it made me so tired. Also after weeks of use it gave me uncontrollable rage and mood swings. He also gave me vyvanse which I had taken as a teenager, which strangely enough does help my anxiety and I can brave panic situations much easier while on it. But it&amp;#39;s no cure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I saw him again and he wanted to put me on Zoloft with Hydroxyzine. It&amp;#39;s frustrating because this goes to show how little so many doctors care. They don&amp;#39;t care enough to even get basic medical history from us. If he did, he would have known that I&amp;#39;ve taken Zoloft before when I was 15 and it made me suicidal.

I&amp;#39;m tired of having doctors spend a minute with me and just give me whatever they feel like I should have. I&amp;#39;m lucky if I spend 60 seconds with my doctor, not even kidding. There&amp;#39;s no time for discussing medical history and the like. To remedy this, I sent over my psychiatric records, which contain detailed logs of everything I&amp;#39;ve taken and how I&amp;#39;ve reacted to those medications.

I desperately needed an advocate to speak for me and help me get my words out, but I was denied. Apparently, because he is a patient there as well if he came in with me that would be a &amp;quot;conflict of interest&amp;quot; I feel discriminated against, almost.

Sadly, this place is my only option, as all other general physicians around here are booked until the summer and I have yet to find a psychiatrist that will take my insurance. I will go without medication if I have to. If he would take the time to get to know me, he would know that I am no drug abuser.

I&amp;#39;m seeing more and more that you gotta be your own doctor because frankly, most actual doctors just don&amp;#39;t give a shit about you. They just want that $$$$ as quick as possible. It&amp;#39;s almost amusing that he pretends that he cares about me being dependent on something. Honestly, if he was given a couple hundred bucks to give me a benzo, he&amp;#39;d hand them over to me like candy, dependency be damned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the rant.

It started with me preferring to stay at home, which gradually morphed into a sense of dread when I had obligations or appointments. From there, over the past year or two, it turned into me having panic attacks and anxiety whenever I had to leave the house. And from there it's only getting worse, as I am prone to suffer from horrid anxiety days before I have plans outside. It's now leading me to not be able to do things I love previously like going to concerts and is making me miss appointments.\nI do relatively fine outside sometimes, but do not cope well with being in vehicles or in large areas or areas with a condensed large amount of people. I'm now realizing that being around a lot of strangers is my main trigger for me, rather than just the simple prospect of being outside of my house. \n\nI'm in therapy now, and surprisingly being in my therapist's office is one of the few places where I feel at ease. We've made a lot of progress, but she strongly advised that I be prescribed a benzo to take as needed to prevent me from missing obligations and to help me keep my head clear in panic situations so I can rationalize through my feelings. \n\nI started seeing a new doctor about this and was given gabapentin. It did help with anxiety, but problem was I couldn't take it during the day when I most needed it because it made me so tired. Also after weeks of use it gave me uncontrollable rage and mood swings. He also gave me vyvanse which I had taken as a teenager, which strangely enough does help my anxiety and I can brave panic situations much easier while on it. But it's no cure.\n\nToday I saw him again and he wanted to put me on Zoloft with Hydroxyzine. It's frustrating because this goes to show how little so many doctors care. They don't care enough to even get basic medical history from us. If he did, he would have known that I've taken Zoloft before when I was 15 and it made me suicidal. So he crossed that out, and that left me with the hydroxyzine -- I was like okay, never heard of that before but it wouldn't hurt to research.\n\nAnd sure enough I look it up and find out that it was Vistaril -- something I have already taken before, but didn't recognize by its chemical/generic name, and CANNOT take due to the fact that it worsened my anxiety and depression and gave me restless legs, on top of feeling like I was hit with a ton of bricks after I take it.\n\nSomeone, please tell me, why oh why, would a doctor give a patient who told them that they only struggle with anxiety when having to leave the house, why would a doctor give them a drug that is notorious for making people lethargic and tired!!\n\nI am tired of not being listened to.

I&amp;#39;m new to Reddit and feel like I&amp;#39;m doing it wrong :/ Hopefully not tho!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have had bouts of agoraphobia my entire life and the most recent relapse began while on Vacation with my current partner for our five year anniversary. It was October 2014. We were out for dinner and immediately after leaving the restaurant and walking to the car my stomach started feeling unwell, initially I didn&amp;#39;t panic, but then I started cramping up and had a surprise sense of urgency. The restaurant was locking their doors and I was in an unfamiliar town and a 20 minute drive from our hotel. I started to panic and had my partner drive as fast as he could to get me to a bathroom. I ended up running into a grocery store, in full panic, and making it to the bathroom. It was the only one in the store and people kept knocking on the door, trying the handle, etc. further intensifying my panic and sense of embarrassment. Once the panic died down and my stomach was calm I insisted we go back to the hotel instead of taking the nighttime walk through the mountain town that we had originally planned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day we went out to a grocery store to get some snacks and drinks and I found myself anxious about going in. What if my stomach got upset again? I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk panicking again so we rushed in and after a few minutes I made my partner leave with me to go back to the hotel. He went out again without me. \nOnce we got back home I started noticing that I was becoming uneasy leaving the house. I started to obsess about the possibility of suddenly having to use the bathroom and not being able to find one. I started to play out scenarios in my head of having an accident in public and being completely humiliated, having panic attacks in public and being completely humiliated. Exasperating the problem was my ibs which is severely triggered by anxiety and panic. As soon as I start to feel anxious my stomach starts to cramp and I need to find a bathroom. So I found myself in an incredibly vicious cycle. The tipping point was one night I planned to drive to the grocery store a few blocks away and found I couldn&amp;#39;t do it. I would make it a few blocks and then go back home. After over an hour I made it there, ran in, started shopping, and when I was almost ready to pay I noticed another customer and their child ask for the bathroom key (occupying the only one in the store) and I lost it. Full blown panic attack. I ran back to my car and sped home. I never drove again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks my world shrunk down to home and work and work was torture. One single bathroom in the building constantly made me feel unsafe. I would panic if one of my employees used the bathroom because of the fear that I would suddenly, urgently need it and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get in. I couldn&amp;#39;t work alone because I was afraid that I would suddenly, urgently need the bathroom while there were customers in the store and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In June 2015 I had to quit my job. The goal was to take time to focus on myself and get better. Summer always made me feel invincible and optimistic so I was sure I would overcome the agoraphobia in a few months. I didn&amp;#39;t. In fact, it got worse. I went from being able to go out occasionally to eat or shop or see a movie (as long as there were ample bathrooms) to not feeling comfortable leaving my house at all because I was terrified that if I did need to use the bathroom while out and about, I would have a panic attack and be trapped in there scared and alone. It seemed too risky. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am two and a half years later and I guess I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone else deals with anything similar? My main problem is figuring out how to do exposures without immediately needing to use the bathroom. Being in a car (driving or as a passenger) and going for walks are terrifying to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;ll be grateful for any responses at all :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everyone!

Because of this she secluded herself to &amp;quot;safe zones&amp;quot; for years upon years. I don&amp;#39;t know what fears you have but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter. Whatever irrational thoughts you have about whatever it is keeping you from living life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These things might happen\u2026 But more than likely they won\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are cowering to your agoraphobia and irrational thoughts. Your thoughts say jump and you jump. They say hide and you hide. You aren\u2019t in control of your life your fears are. The worst part though is...that you take it. You are in the place you are right now because you want to be there. Just how long are you going to let fear dictate your actions in life?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just giving into hiding from what you know is most likely not going to happen? Wherever you are right now with your agoraphobia you are there because you want to be there. You are keeping yourself in this miserable state&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;because it is comfortable...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it is comfortable because you\u2019re not putting yourself in a state of distress. You stay in your comfort zone and that\u2019s all. There is a drawback to this though. You can only stay in your comfort zone and go nowhere else. For some their comfort zones get smaller and smaller until they are confined to their bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this happens because that&amp;#39;s what happened to me. There were places I could go and then places that were off limits. When I went outside of my comfort zone I would have a full blown panic attack. I wasn\u2019t always like this though... What happened to that outgoing, energetic, adventurous guy who was ready to take on the world when he was younger?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear of what might happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what happened. It became my obsession. I constantly was on the lookout for danger and looking around every corner. That&amp;#39;s what agoraphobia does to you...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of an incident where I had a panic attack in public. That&amp;#39;s all it took. I didn&amp;#39;t want people to think I was crazy if I had another panic attack so I retreated to places I knew were safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Irrational thoughts flooded my mind. When I was able to \u201csolve\u201d one irrational fear another appeared in it\u2019s place. My mind was constantly creating scenarios and fears that ruled my life. It began with a thought like &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t go there anymore because that&amp;#39;s where I had my last panic attack&amp;quot; then my mind started making excuses why I couldn&amp;#39;t go other places until I couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things that didn&amp;#39;t even cross my mind my entire life were now at the forefront of my mind all the time. I wasn\u2019t able to drive anymore, I relied a lot on my parents throughout this process, and any time any friends would call me I would decline. This lasted for a year until I faced my fears head on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enough is enough. I will not let you control my life. I will beat this and I will start living my life again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shut up! These are just irrational thoughts&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became a game I played with myself. Anytime I had a fear about something I purposefully put myself in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think of my mind as almost like two parts. I imagine a living room where there is an old wise man sitting in a car and a young boy sitting on the floor. Depending on your mental state one of these people is controlling what is happening in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you letting the young boy be at the forefront and keep you in a state of fear because of irrational thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or are you letting the old wise man talk through situations and speak some commonsense into your mind?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who are you letting control your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How To Rid Yourself of Agoraphobia&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Determine what exactly you are afraid of. Carry a notepad with you and write down the thoughts that are coming up in your mind when you are exposed to uncomfortable situations. What is it that you are afraid of exactly? What is keeping you from living your life? No matter how ridiculous the thoughts are write them down. By writing these things down you can find similarities and thus find the root of the problem. What underlying issue is keeping you secluded?\nUnderstand that thoughts are just that and nothing else. Just because you think something doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will happen even if the thoughts have some truth to them. Look at the thoughts you have written down in step 1. In a &amp;quot;safe place&amp;quot; or a place of comfort read these things to yourself and really think them over. Identify these thoughts in your mind as irrational thoughts because that is what they are. The likely hood of these things happening are incredibly slim.\nExpose yourself to your fears and keep yourself there. (this is the hardest part but it needs to be done) You have convinced yourself that these thoughts that you have will happen if you expose yourself to uncomfortable situations. You need to convince yourself and ultimately your mind that these things you think will happen won\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not talking about 5 minutes either. You need to work your way up. Start small but if you are going to get over this you need to be exposing yourself for longer and longer periods of time every time you do this exercise. Take baby steps and work your way up. No matter what happens keep yourself in that situation and sit in the fear. You need to realize that there are no \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201cunsafe spaces\u201d everywhere around you could be \u201cdangerous\u201d or \u201csafe. (I have purposefully went to a grocery store and just walked around for hours upon hours because that was a fearful place for me to go or I walked in the park for hours at a time.)\nWhen in the fearful state divert your attention away from the fear. Don\u2019t constantly focus on the fear or what you think will happen. Instead think of something that brings joy to you. It could be whatever. A funny video you have seen, your favorite song, focus on your kids. Anything that keeps your mind away from the fearful thoughts you have. Something I did for the longest time is when a fearful thought would come into my mind I would focus on a million kittens in a room. I don&amp;#39;t know why but it always cheered me up and got my mind off of my irrational fears. Your fearful thoughts are going to want to take over. Just continue diverting your thoughts to that cheerful happy place and they will eventually stop. Overtime your mind will automatically go to that happy place. You are training your mind to do this subconsciously on its own.\nBe patient and continue working on this everyday. How bad do you want to rid yourself of agoraphobia? You need to do this for yourself and no one else. Why do you want to be free from agoraphobia? Write it down and anytime you are uncomfortable pull out that piece of paper as to why you want to get rid of agoraphobia. Ask for help from friends or family and have them push you to do things that you don\u2019t want to do. If someone is going to the grocery store go with them. If someone invited you to go somewhere where there will be a lot of people go with them. Push yourself and make it a game of it to put yourself in an uncomfortable situation. Anytime you are afraid of a situation that should become your focus. You should automatically run to that fear and face it head on. I promise when you get out of this you will feel so free and alive again.

That morning I was going to be looking at a house I wanted to purchase. A house I was planning to flip that I had been looking at for a while but wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to buy or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My uncle was on his way to see the house to inspect it so I quickly picked up some McDonalds and bought a Big Mac, fries, and a large Coke.

Adrenaline was coursing throughout my body and my heart was beating abnormally fast. I just couldn\u2019t calm down and my panic continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without much thought I closed my eyes and ran to the car and got in. \u201cI have to leave.

Kat can control gravity so she really just falls in every direction, and she can jump really high. I suffer sensitivities that really caused all my agoraphobia to happen. Noises are too loud and really upset, light, movement and touch. It was hell since I was born until 16 when I found therapy for it. The therapy is deep pressure input, and basically high gravity would pretty much calm me down forever.

I used to jump off the top of my swings when it was high as possible in the air to get that feeling too. Ironically I am sensitive to heights too, so as a kid I couldn&amp;#39;t walk up stairs that you could see the bottom floor through without severe sensory overload and anxiety attacks.

It&amp;#39;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I have PTSD, and part of my PTSD is watching other people suffer and be abused. And in this game you get to play the role of a superhero (the cutscenes are even done in comic book style) so I feel like I&amp;#39;m Superman at the same time. You get to save the town from oppression and huge clas division, and save people from giant monsters. It&amp;#39;s like three huge levels of catharsis for me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t just want to use escapism forever, but I don&amp;#39;t even think this game is escapism for me anymore.

On top of this, I have essentially lost my (already barely existent) sex drive because of this, and the last time I had an orgasm it took me a half hour to recover from the anxiety it triggered. Fun!\n\nI've also barely been moving because everything that raises my heart rate makes me feel panic-y and I stop as soon as I start to try to calm down. I used to love jogging, and dancing or lifting but these days I can't bring myself to do any of it.\n\nI feel so weak. People mention fun things casually (going out, going to the gym, smoking weed, going somewhere alone etc) and I feel so sad because those things seem so far away. Like, I forget what it's like to do things. \n\nThis was partially a venting seshion because no one I know irl seems to be able to relate, and partially a request for advice. How am I supposed to take baby steps? This is scary for me, I feel like I'm losing myself. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5sbj8c", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Scared of being alone and exercise", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_5sbj8c", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/5sbj8c/scared_of_being_alone_and_exercise/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1486376513.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/5sbj8c/scared_of_being_alone_and_exercise/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "atemperlikemyjelousy", "created_utc": 1486347713.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I start classes tomorrow.

So, I&amp;#39;d like to know: what is yours like? What&amp;#39;s your story?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My experience with agoraphobia deals with wide open environments, such as empty parking lots, crosswalks, and sidewalks. When entering one of these &amp;quot;trigger areas&amp;quot;, as my psychologist calls them, I immediately feel instinctively unsafe, accompanied by an incredible amount of dizziness -- almost as if my feet have a lightness to them and my head is no longer attached to my body -- and this often leads to a panic attack, if I do not quickly exit the &amp;quot;trigger area&amp;quot;. The fear, I think, has to do with falling. Now, it&amp;#39;s a completely bizarre, baseless, and irrational thing to fear falling, since it isn&amp;#39;t life threatening, but the panic is overwhelming and I simply can&amp;#39;t explain why. (Of note, my agoraphobia &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; seems to rear its ugly head when I am outside, standing on concrete, pavement, or some other hard surface. A soft, grassy surface, an open field of flowers, or even a wide open Wal-Mart do not effect me). The rationale here my brain must be using is that Wal-Mart, while busy, loud, and large, is a &amp;quot;safe zone&amp;quot; due to all of the objects available for support, should I in fact fall over (which, I know, totally isn&amp;#39;t going to happen), and likewise, the soft, grassy environments provide a sense of safety and cushion, should my fears become realized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To better explain my sensations, I equate them to what might be experienced by an individual with a fearfulness of heights who is standing atop a very, very tall, unstable ladder. This may also occur when driving, contingent upon the speed, business, and size of the road. Ultimately, pathways end up feeling slanted, my feet feel weightless, my head feels detached, my face tingles, my balance is off, and I simply feel like I need something or someone to hold onto, or some catastrophe might happen. My psychologist referred to this as &amp;quot;catastrophic thinking&amp;quot; and said it may very well be due to a lack of confidence in in my ability to handle or react appropriately to pressure situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting more into the history of my experiences, my agoraphobia was virtually nonexistent until my teenage years, where it would occasionally attack walking to a vehicle, running, etc. In fact, I remember one instance in which I was hitting the final stretch at a cross country meet; dozens of people lined the edges of the track, cheering for the runners. In the midst of all the noise, I could hear my coach yelling from the sidelines, encouraging me to finish fast. Then, as quickly as one might blink, my phobia struck. The dizziness was so overwhelming that I came to a standstill in the middle of the race, grabbed my spinning head with both hands as it felt as if it was no longer a part of my body, and stood there in angst. I ended up finishing, albeit, I walked the rest of the way. I, and my coach, always assumed this to be the result of dehydration. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 17, I was put on Lexapro for major depressive disorder, and remained on the drug for four years. Six months ago, I decided to come off of it without medical supervision. The withdrawals were nothing short of a horror movie, but I digress.

Y&amp;#39;know, these things that you might have seen in school if you had a super-cool teacher, or in your art class: &lt;a href=\"http://www.creativecounseling101.com/play-therapy-activity-warm-fuzzies.html\"&gt;http://www.creativecounseling101.com/play-therapy-activity-warm-fuzzies.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Mom, a long-time Elementary School teacher (who is now retired) is one of those fun Creative types who used Warm Fuzzies in her classroom, as a way of promoting positive behavior in her students! And not just educators use them---some therapists are beginning to as well (as highlighted in the above link). Recently, the &amp;quot;kid in me&amp;quot; asked my Mom for some &amp;quot;Warm Fuzzies&amp;quot;, which she happily sent in the mail (she now lives in another state). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I thought to myself: What if I sent some Warm Fuzzies for others to enjoy, as a way of helping them with Exposure Therapy? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that when I have something warm and soft to hold, that&amp;#39;s small and can be kept discreetly in either my palm, or my pocket, I feel so much better---especially when going out and about in the world! Most of the time I carry crystals (i.e. think of &amp;quot;worry stones&amp;quot;) with me. But &amp;quot;Warm Fuzzies&amp;quot; can work just as well! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as you can read on my new Blog &lt;a href=\"http://silverfeathersfurries.tumblr.com\"&gt;http://silverfeathersfurries.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Fuzzies Against Fear&amp;quot; is my Project to reach out to others with anxiety, and send them 2 Warm Fuzzies!!!! (You can opt for 1 or 2 if you&amp;#39;d prefer). This will require you trusting me with your address---but don&amp;#39;t worry, I won&amp;#39;t spam your mailbox! This is simply to send you a small Warm Fuzzy friend, who can accompany you on your Journeys---be it to another room in your house, or to the mailbox, or further down the street if you&amp;#39;re feeling brave enough that day! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please PM me with Addresses as I will be sending colorful, soft and fun Warm Fuzzies out hopefully this month (just ordered a bunch of them!) And please do visit my Blog, where I will be updating with fun creative things to do at home with your Warm Fuzzies, general news about the &amp;quot;Fuzzies Against Fear&amp;quot; project, and other great ideas to combat anxiety!!!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: This is not just for sufferers of agoraphobia.

I have never felt more under the control of my anxiety and have never had to be more drugged up just to get through the day or function around people. Even with the chemical help, I barely keep afloat. This last year I missed out on all my family holidays functions for the first time ever and made some of my family quite upset with me. Of course they had no idea I spent the holidays at home alone crying and wishing so bad I could be there with them. I now get periodic voicemails reminding me how I&amp;#39;ve let them down, which only makes me want to hide away more. I&amp;#39;m trying to salvage these relationships, but since this agoraphobia problem isn&amp;#39;t just going away, I&amp;#39;m not exactly doing a good job of fixing anything because it&amp;#39;s so difficult for me to stick to my word regarding plans. I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time until I lose the support and care of family members as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as the title says, I&amp;#39;m pushing my last remaining true friend away. I may have officially lost my long time best friend last night. I think I&amp;#39;ve cancelled/flaked enough times that she&amp;#39;s finally giving up on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one particular best friend has known for a long time how much I struggle with anxiety. We were friends before it got really bad so she once knew a much more happy, outgoing me, but she also was there to see that person fade away. She stayed my friend the whole time even though I became increasingly distant. She struggles with anxiety too, so that&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;s been so understanding and patient. She knows my mental issues are at their worst, but I don&amp;#39;t think she understands the extent of it. She doesn&amp;#39;t struggle to go outside or do basic chores/errands like I do, and she definitely doesn&amp;#39;t witness the meltdowns I have at home before I leave or even the ones I&amp;#39;ve publicly had in the middle of a grocery store or bank or wherever. It&amp;#39;s not like I publicly share these things or want to, so I guess how could she know how bad it is? I guess I&amp;#39;m really the one to blame that she takes my never &amp;quot;going-out&amp;quot; so personally. I don&amp;#39;t blame her for taking my shitty friendship personally... I would too... That&amp;#39;s the worst part... I don&amp;#39;t even blame anyone for giving up on me. It&amp;#39;s hard not to hate myself for being such a shitty friend/person all the time. I actually just sit at home shaming myself for missing whatever I shouldn&amp;#39;t be missing... like I did last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This best friend had a birthday party last night that I promised to go to. I even wanted to go to it because I love HER and desperately wanted her to know that and feel that since I know &amp;quot;going-out&amp;quot; is a big deal to her... Especially after never being around even though she&amp;#39;s been there for me when I needed it. I knew at the very least that I owed it to her to just show up at the party and give her my presents (handmade presents I worked on all day for her... I really do value her friendship) but at the last minute I freaked out about having to drive alone in the dark in my crappy car (it needed gas and the tires are low, which is a whole other huge set of public tasks for me to overcome before even facing driving), and I freaked out about having to socialize with her other &amp;quot;best friends&amp;quot; who I have a hard time being around because they act like socializing is a competition. I&amp;#39;m always happy to lose this competition so when I&amp;#39;m around them, I usually end up retreating in a corner by myself, escaping in a cab or uber, sending her a text saying I&amp;#39;m sorry I left, and then bawl my eyes out at home. Since I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to drive to her party and I couldn&amp;#39;t bear doing the whole socializing-retreating-escaping-bawling thing yet another time, I just decided not to go. I profusely apologized and offered to have her come over to my house a different time to make her tea and give her my gifts, but all she said back was, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s okay.&amp;quot; This morning she&amp;#39;s done nothing but share photos on social media of her party saying how wonderful her best friends were to her last night. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t take any of it personally, but my goodness does it hurt to see since I was once that &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; to her and I&amp;#39;ve slowly been pushed out. I am just so upset at myself for doing it myself, and I feel so heartbroken. I&amp;#39;m grateful this friend stuck around as long as she did despite my constant flakiness, and I wish I hadn&amp;#39;t ruined it last night. At this point, I decided my best course of action was just to apologize one more time and ask for her address to send her the presents. She said she would see me whenever I felt like it and gave me her address. I made another attempt to make plans that didn&amp;#39;t involve going out and socializing, but I feel like I just keep setting myself up to be rejected by someone who is fed up with me. I&amp;#39;m just awaiting her response now, hoping she hasn&amp;#39;t actually completely given up on me like I think she has. A part of me maybe would even be relieved if she did.... I love her and would miss her like crazy, but I don&amp;#39;t even know how to be a friend anymore, and I know that&amp;#39;s not fair to her. Sometimes I think I should just let the friendship die and let her hate me... I&amp;#39;m exhausted from feeling like I&amp;#39;m always trying to save our friendship and from having to apologize for myself ALL the time, even if the apologies are warranted. She&amp;#39;s the one &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; I have left though... I just can&amp;#39;t come to terms with the fact I really have pushed everyone away... And I can&amp;#39;t tell anyone why because I am too ashamed of how bad my anxiety has gotten. Maybe it&amp;#39;s all just my anxiety talking. It&amp;#39;s hard to know anymore. I am my anxiety. My anxiety is me. I am a prisoner to myself, and I&amp;#39;ve made myself a prisoner in my own home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there&amp;#39;s no point to this post besides just getting my feelings out and telling the internet I&amp;#39;ve officially lost my last remaining best friend because I can&amp;#39;t tell anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I&amp;#39;ve had GAD and SPD for a long time. It has resulted in being fairly agoraphobic for about the past couple years. Cancelling and flaking on people has only gotten worse and worse. I&amp;#39;ve lost most of my friends which hasn&amp;#39;t actually been a big deal to me, but losing my last remaining true &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; has been really devastating. I can&amp;#39;t seem to give up on the friendship even though holding on is hurting both of us. I think we keep holding out for when I will get better, but I don&amp;#39;t know when that will be. She had a birthday party last night that I flaked out on, and I think it was her final straw with me. I am trying to salvage the friendship by offering to hang out at my home and do things for her here, but she doesn&amp;#39;t seem happy with me and hasn&amp;#39;t said anything about hanging out that doesn&amp;#39;t involve going out. Most of my family is upset at me as well for being shut away for so long and missing holiday functions. I&amp;#39;m just feeling very down for pushing everyone away even though that is never what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Sorry for the extremely long post.

I really do value her friendship) but at the last minute I freaked out about having to drive alone in the dark in my crappy car (it needed gas and the tires are low, which is a whole other huge set of public tasks for me to overcome before even facing driving), and I freaked out about having to socialize with her other \"best friends\" who I have a hard time being around because they act like socializing is a competition. I'm always happy to lose this competition so when I'm around them, I usually end up retreating in a corner by myself, escaping in a cab or uber, sending her a text saying I'm sorry I left, and then bawl my eyes out at home. Since I couldn't bring myself to drive to her party and I couldn't bear doing the whole socializing-retreating-escaping-bawling thing yet another time, I just decided not to go. I profusely apologized and offered to have her come over to my house a different time to make her tea and give her my gifts, but all she said back was, \"it's okay.\" This morning she's done nothing but share photos on social media of her party saying how wonderful her best friends were to her last night. I know I shouldn't take any of it personally, but my goodness does it hurt to see since I was once that \"best friend\" to her and I've slowly been pushed out. I am just so upset at myself for doing it myself, and I feel so heartbroken. I'm grateful this friend stuck around as long as she did despite my constant flakiness, and I wish I hadn't ruined it last night. At this point, I decided my best course of action was just to apologize one more time and ask for her address to send her the presents. She said she would see me whenever I felt like it and gave me her address. I made another attempt to make plans that didn't involve going out and socializing, but I feel like I just keep setting myself up to be rejected by someone who is fed up with me. I'm just awaiting her response now, hoping she hasn't actually completely given up on me like I think she has. A part of me maybe would even be relieved if she did.... I love her and would miss her like crazy, but I don't even know how to be a friend anymore, and I know that's not fair to her. Sometimes I think I should just let the friendship die and let her hate me... I'm exhausted from feeling like I'm always trying to save our friendship and from having to apologize for myself ALL the time, even if the apologies are warranted. She's the one \"best friend\" I have left though... I just can't come to terms with the fact I really have pushed everyone away... And I can't tell anyone why because I am too ashamed of how bad my anxiety has gotten. Maybe it's all just my anxiety talking. It's hard to know anymore. I am my anxiety. My anxiety is me. I am a prisoner to myself, and I've made myself a prisoner in my own home.\n\nAnyways, there's no point to this post besides just getting my feelings out and telling the internet I've officially lost my last remaining best friend because I can't tell anyone else.\n\nTLDR: I've had GAD and SPD for a long time. It has resulted in being fairly agoraphobic for about the past couple years. Cancelling and flaking on people has only gotten worse and worse. I've lost most of my friends which hasn't actually been a big deal to me, but losing my last remaining true \"best friend\" has been really devastating. I can't seem to give up on the friendship even though holding on is hurting both of us. I think we keep holding out for when I will get better, but I don't know when that will be. She had a birthday party last night that I flaked out on, and I think it was her final straw with me. I am trying to salvage the friendship by offering to hang out at my home and do things for her here, but she doesn't seem happy with me and hasn't said anything about hanging out that doesn't involve going out. Most of my family is upset at me as well for being shut away for so long and missing holiday functions. I'm just feeling very down for pushing everyone away even though that is never what I wanted.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5m8vgb", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I'm pushing my last remaining true friend away.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 10, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1483668318.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_5m8vgb", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/5m8vgb/im_pushing_my_last_remaining_true_friend_away/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1483677216.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/5m8vgb/im_pushing_my_last_remaining_true_friend_away/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "naturegurl", "created_utc": 1483648416.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, I had such anxiety that I couldn&amp;#39;t leave my neighborhood.

When I was 18 I got up to go to the bathroom in my house and I experienced my first panic attack. It was quite mild, in my head I feared I wasn&amp;#39;t going to make it to the bathroom and I had some heart pounding. It didn&amp;#39;t phase me all that much. The next day I went out to a temporary agency to fill out some papers for work placement and I ended up having another attack and I actually thought it was funny! It came and went and that was it. No real fear. Then I kept getting them and started fearing them until I made my mom drive me to the doctor. Sadly the doctor was of no help. I kind of layed low that year, going out minimally if at all. Somehow the anxiety went away, it may have been because I was young and had a lot of friends and family around, I guess I just kinda snapped out of it. I went on to go to college in a dorm, dated a few different people, got my license, got a few different jobs, lived normally. When I was 24 I met my husband online. For years we went everywhere together, even took a trip across country on planes etc. We got married when I was 27. I remember when we were on the altar I started to have a panic attack so I quickly flung off my high heels and grounded myself. I then talked myself out of it. That was the first time I had an attack since 18. I shrugged it off because I figured it was normal since I was in a high pressure situation Infront of so many people. Fast forward to two years later. I went on a diet to lose some weight and decided to add walking into my plan. I started walking around a track one day, and BOOM out of no where I started panicking! My heart started the pounding, and I ran to the car for solace. Complete panic. As soon as I got home of course I was better. This was about seven years ago. These past seven years have been pretty torturous! I was able to work and keep my job up until about three years ago. My panic attacks were just becoming so frequent, that driving to work I would have an attack, walking into work I would sometimes panic, at my desk etc. My quality of life was really starting to dwindle. It got much worse after I quit my job! I never knew anxiety and panic attacks and agoraphobia could be so severe. When I have panic attacks themselves, my symptoms are as follows..you may be able to relate......I get really quiet, my heart feels like it&amp;#39;s gonna pound outta my chest, I feel light-headed and off balance, then I have to run to a safe zone! I eventually stopped going out. I was having panic attacks in my bed. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be around people. The nervous stomach is so annoying, head pressure etc. Through this extreme anxiety state I ended up getting pregnant with my son. I am not one for doctors, I also fear doctors, have really bad white coat syndrome, and I have no clue how I stayed in a hospital for three days having my son, with my anxiety. The worst part is that the hospital staff did not understand about anxiety!!! So frustrating. I am very against  drugs, I tried a couple of antianxiety meds but they make me feel worse. This is why I don&amp;#39;t go to doctors, because they just don&amp;#39;t get it, and it doesn&amp;#39;t help when you fear them, and I fear my own health. I have health anxiety on top of it so Everything little thing to to me, every ache or cold is cancer, or something terminal. I&amp;#39;m trying to pull myself out of this slowly but surely. Having a child is proving to be helpful. I don&amp;#39;t want to disappoint him when he gets big. There is a book called hope and help for your nerves by Clare Weekes. Read it. Since I read it I have shopped in small stores with my husband, we have taken our son out to the park, and last weekend we drove 45 minutes to my husband&amp;#39;s parents house.

It&amp;#39;s not that you wish to stay inside incredibly constricting comfort zones. It&amp;#39;s a hugely debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me personally, I had years where I didn&amp;#39;t feel safe anywhere except my home. Simply imagining leaving home could induce a panic attack, let alone actually taking a single step out the front door. I was unable to go anywhere, I couldn&amp;#39;t deal with the overwhelming anxiety and fear. I would literally feel like I was going to die, no question about it. It&amp;#39;s quite hard to leave your house when all you can foresee is your own death. I dropped out of school, I was unable to work, there were some days where even leaving my bedroom took enormous willpower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues with agoraphobia is sensory overload. What this means is your brain gets overwhelmed with all the external stimuli and reaches a point where it can&amp;#39;t deal with it anymore. Imagine noises becoming louder, lights becoming brighter and smells becoming stronger all at once, while your brain basically shuts down as it&amp;#39;s being overworked. You feel sick to your stomach, faint, dizzy, like you&amp;#39;re about to throw up or pass out. It&amp;#39;s a hard thing to imagine if you&amp;#39;ve never experienced it before, but it is often likened to a panic attack. The open space becomes an incredibly suffocating experience and causes much distress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some, they wish they could go out. They wish they could go to the cinemas to watch the new movie they&amp;#39;re interested in, or take their dog to the nearby park. For others they&amp;#39;ve basically come to terms with the agoraphobia and no longer have desires to go out. I&amp;#39;ve been on both sides, and neither are nice to deal with. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to visit New Zealand, as I&amp;#39;m a big fan of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, but the process feels impossible, and now I no longer wish to go at all. It&amp;#39;s sad to think that agoraphobia has so much control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly it is extremely isolating. You can&amp;#39;t attend birthday parties or go out with friends, that is if you still keep in contact with people at all. Often it&amp;#39;s easier to just drop connections with people so you don&amp;#39;t need to make excuses as to why you can&amp;#39;t go meet them in town, or go for a sleepover or explain why you spend so much time at home. Part of you starts to prefer being alone, so you don&amp;#39;t disappoint people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is just a glimpse into what being severely agoraphobic is like, but it can manifest in many forms and everyone who has it will have their own experience. Some people can still go out to certain places but will completely avoid others. Some people force themselves to go to places they&amp;#39;re terrified about going to and hide their fear as best they can. Some people overcome it with time and help.

Often it's easier to just drop connections with people so you don't need to make excuses as to why you can't go meet them in town, or go for a sleepover or explain why you spend so much time at home. Part of you starts to prefer being alone, so you don't disappoint people. \n\nThis is just a glimpse into what being severely agoraphobic is like, but it can manifest in many forms and everyone who has it will have their own experience. Some people can still go out to certain places but will completely avoid others. Some people force themselves to go to places they're terrified about going to and hide their fear as best they can. Some people overcome it with time and help. Either way I hope this has been somewhat informative. Please message me if you're struggling and need someone to talk to, or ask any questions you may have.

First I had to force myself to walk across the street. Then, I forced myself to walk up the 3 flights to our office where I work with my husband (thankfully, it&amp;#39;s right across the street).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, I forced myself to take a ride with my husband, sister and her boyfriend all in the car, and her boyfriend (who we&amp;#39;re close with) was driving. Went all the way over to their house, which was only 15 mns away and in the next town---but still, it was a huge step forward for me! (I had to ask him to stop and pull over to the side only once, but once I got out and walked around, I was fine, and we kept right on going!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felt fine at their house. Fast forward to a couple of days later. My close friend tells me about a Holiday party she&amp;#39;s hosting at her place, which is right around the corner from where I live. I decided to go myself (to prove I could do it). I brought a bottle of water put on my favorite jewelry. I put on one of my nicest shirts. I went over there, and actually---for the first time in a long time---MINGLED with several people in the same room!!! (It was a bright room, too---and bright light has been a trigger for anxiety for me for awhile.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually, for the first time in a loooong time, felt like my &amp;quot;old self&amp;quot; again! I met with old friends, and even made some possible new friends---just talking about random stuff, and not really overthinking it too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did I do this? When I got anxious about something, I tried to focus on people I felt really comfortable with and who knew me very well. I reassured myself that if something were to happen to me---like, for instance, I were to get sick in public, or pass out or something (two of my biggest fears) that they wouldn&amp;#39;t judge me, or stop being friends with me (they&amp;#39;re not that kind of people, at least I really doubt that they are).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I focused on positive things in the room, like fun foods I liked to eat (there was lots of it!), the sparkling Christmas tree (how pretty!) the beautiful artwork on the walls (nice scenes of nature, which reminds me of peaceful walks in the woods and going down by the river).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;d get anxious, sometimes I&amp;#39;d look at my phone, but I tried VERY hard not to---I actually managed to keep it in my pocket for most of the time. I actually did call my mom at one point, to talk about casual things, nothing too deep, just about what I was doing (which helped a LOT.) She was happy for me, which also was nice! (She knows how hard it is for me to be out in public around lots of people.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed that when I&amp;#39;m talking one on one with someone, it helps to stare at the floor---or looking at something else in the room--- and not at their face. (I did this with a few different people, and nobody seemed fazed by it!) That helped lessen the anxiety a bit because I didn&amp;#39;t have to be distracted by their facial expressions (which I guess is actually another trigger I didn&amp;#39;t even realize was one until now).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For most people, going to a party might not seem like a huge victory---and it wasn&amp;#39;t always such a hard thing for me to do---but after months of being stuck indoors due to severely crippling anxiety, it was like a breath of fresh air!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this continues. I&amp;#39;m really trying so hard to get my life back. On Saturday night (Christmas Eve) I&amp;#39;m going back to my sister&amp;#39;s to spend the evening there, so that I can wake up and surprise my 10 year old niece on Christmas Morning (I haven&amp;#39;t been able to see her in a year, because of anxiety traveling and having guests over).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully she hasn&amp;#39;t stopped loving me (which was a big fear of mine for awhile) because I hadn&amp;#39;t seen her in so very long. (How do you explain agoraphobia to a 10 year old? How do you explain debilitating anxiety without traumatizing them for life?) I only told her partially that I wasn&amp;#39;t traveling due to majorly bad vertigo (which was hard enough to explain) because of allergies, which was what partially kind of started the anxiety worsening and fear of going outside, making me fear that I would pass out from the lightheadedness and dizziness that accompanies vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, however, I am hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan on going this Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I hope to work at the office instead of from home (which I usually do).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;#39;s right across the street from me---I think I can swing it!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s wishing you guys all a new year full of as much less anxiety as possible!

I don't want this to feel like a competition, and you won't be shamed if you aren't able to do what you planned. \n\nSome examples:\n\n-If you are completely homebound, maybe challenge yourself to walk out to your mailbox and back.\n\n-If you have transportation and a friend or family member who can take you, maybe go to a grocery store. Walk until you hit the produce section and then turn around and leave. \n\n-If you don't have transportation, walk down your street and take pics of the scenery to share with us. \n\nEtc etc. \n\nI thought we could use this thread to share what we plan to do, who's with me! :D", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5halsk", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Let's challenge ourselves next week?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 11, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2szqz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_5halsk", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Agoraphobia/comments/5halsk/lets_challenge_ourselves_next_week/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1481271345.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/5halsk/lets_challenge_ourselves_next_week/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "starryeyed702", "created_utc": 1481242545.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Agoraphobia", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Agoraphobia", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Agoraphobia", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gv1CqAQVow\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gv1CqAQVow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I&amp;#39;m missing out on so much in life, and exposure therapy is taking an extremely long time for me to get out beyond my own lawn.

I live on a busy street in a second floor apartment. Lately, I've been pushing myself to take a little walk (not too far at all) just outside the door at night. I wear my hoodie, and I feel protected, and this cooler weather helps tons! (Heat is a trigger for me for some reason.) \n\nI've definitely been making some progress. Raising Sertraline to 50 mlg helps a lot, and I suggest to everyone here, TAKE YOUR VITAMINS!!!! (B12 is especially helpful I find for energy, and for those of us who don't get a lot of sun, make sure you're getting your Vitamin D---something I have to probably take more of!) \n\nUpdates on my progress: \n\nRecently, I've been able to cross the street in two different places from my door, and the other night, I was able to cross 2 streets in the same night---actually make that 3!!! It feels So nice to be able to finally look at a destination, say \"I want to go THERE\" and DO it! \n\nTonight was a REAL breakthru~! I crossed the street at a very busy time (between 8 and 9 pmish). Traffic is very busy at this time of night. Typically just watching the cars whizz by makes me feel dizzy and scared, but today, I waited until there were no cars and ran across the street, then ran back---it was EXHILERATING!!!!

They involved driving to a place where I wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable (for me, this was about 6km away) and sitting for 5 minutes (I used a meditation timer on my phone), trying to feel the panic and let it pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had some good success with this method, and found that my &amp;quot;comfort zone&amp;quot; had noticeably expanded within 5 days. There was one specific spot that for whatever reason inspired greater anxiety (it was a bit further, and also felt further because of a curve in the road). There I had a few moments of what felt like 10/10 anxiety. While I engaged in some compulsive behaviors (fumbled for the keys, hit the passenger seat with my hand which for whatever reason makes me feel like I&amp;#39;m in control), I didn&amp;#39;t actually start the car, and didn&amp;#39;t leave until the anxiety had greatly reduced. The next time I went I had some moments of 8/10 anxiety, but they passed as well. And the next time was almost boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately around this time I started having issues with depression. I don&amp;#39;t consider myself clinically depressed, but I do occasionally have self-esteem issues mostly relating to my recent / lifelong bad luck with finding romance. I found that my exposures were mostly just feeding my depression (ie: I would just sit there and think about depression, and couldn&amp;#39;t really focus on much else given the brain fog) so I decided to take a break until it passed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit better and should get back to doing exposures soon. However, I will share one thought I had while doing exposures that may or may not be of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, my plan was to drive to these places and sit for 5 minutes (or until the anxiety passed). I&amp;#39;d say that this is a form of meditation. I chose to sit with my eyes open, because eyes closed scares me a bit more (which might be a good thing for exposures, but I figured in most situations I would actually want my eyes open so I decided to practice as such).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, one thing I noticed is that sitting calmly and staring out into space produced specific visual anomalies that led me to feel anxious. I&amp;#39;d say there were two notable effects:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Troxler&amp;#39;s fading &amp;amp; related visual illusions: when you stare at one place for a while, your vision basically starts getting weird. Things can look blurry, brightness can change, you can perceive the world in a weird, textural way and so on. As you might expect, these feelings certainly can make you feel like you&amp;#39;re out of control, or losing control, or whatever. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When you stop meditation / staring out into space and rejoin the &amp;quot;normal world&amp;quot; things have a sort of dreamy feel to them. The world seems to move more slowly, or feel unreal. I found that some of my biggest anxiety spikes actually came after I quit sitting, because the world just looked different or seemed &amp;quot;weirder&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think these effects are worth mentioning because they are things you can exposure yourself to independent from your usual exposure therapy. For instance, I can go to a park and practice meditation / sitting / staring into space, as well as feeling the &amp;quot;afterglow&amp;quot; resulting from it. Perhaps if I do that regularly I will become accustomed to the feelings and they won&amp;#39;t effect me as much going forward. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I&amp;#39;m thinking that meditation is something else I should practice going forward.

The diagnoses I have received over the years have included bipolar disorder (type II), GAD, social anxiety, ADHD, hypersomnia, and so on. Bipolar disorder and GAD in particular have run at least 4 generations deep within my maternal bloodline. I have also dealt with emotional abuse and neglect from both sides of my immediate family, so when I gained acceptance to a highly-rated university nearly three hours from my hometown, I genuinely felt that going to college would be the cure to all of my mental ills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things were fine for a year or so. I was getting decent grades, making friends, and even joined a few clubs and held down a part-time job. I still experienced a significant degree of social anxiety as well as some depression, but I was &amp;quot;functional.&amp;quot; Then, unexpectedly, and after only a month at a food service job that I worked hard at and showed up to 15 minutes early each day, I was &amp;quot;let go&amp;quot; with no explanation other than my personality being somehow being wrong for the job. Within a few months, I was housebound and could not leave without having severe anxiety attacks unless I was with someone I trusted, and even then only went at the opening and closing times of the dining hall to keep myself from starving to death. I mistrusted everyone, and on the few occasions where I forced myself to go to lecture, I left within 15-30 minutes in a panic because I felt that everyone around me was silently judging me. Regular antidepressants (Prozac, Zoloft) were doing nothing for me, and I was terrified of benzodiazapines due to my mother&amp;#39;s previous addiction to Ativan. When I inevitably dropped out of college, my father&amp;#39;s response was to take my car away from me and mostly forgo contact with me. I moved in with my mother, who had experienced depression and anxiety that kept her on disability for years, but was nonetheless very impatient with me, and ultimately kicked me out a year later, one week after I left my job at an animal shelter where the workplace culture was catty at best and abusive at worst. Her parting words: &amp;quot;Kill yourself if you&amp;#39;re going to kill yourself, I&amp;#39;m done caring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, due to my work experience, the kindness of my then-boyfriend&amp;#39;s parents who allowed me to live with them for a month, and a well-timed hypomanic episode, I found a new job with better pay as well as an apartment in a familiar, pleasant location within a few days. Unfortunately, I was broke as hell (roughly $50-$100 left per month after taking care of absolutely necessary life expenses), unable to pay off old bills and student loans and unable to read my mail or call lenders due to anxiety, which sent my credit into the shitter, became isolated due to lack of money or energy for social events with friends, and often could not afford money for medication, much less therapy. I was often suicidal over the past year, but pushed through, holding on to the vague hope that I wouldn&amp;#39;t always feel so desperate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today: I&amp;#39;m 22 years old, employed full-time for over a year in a non-profit job where I&amp;#39;ve received awards for my performance, newly enrolled in a human services program (online, for now) at community college, and plan on putting my future degree to work by creating accessible programs to assist people with chronic mental illness in self-empowerment. I would particularly love to create an outreach volunteer program that sends people to assist mentally ill people struggling to leave their homes or perform basic life tasks like grocery shopping or calling to set up appointments. I&amp;#39;m still pretty broke, but have several better-paying job prospects, and last week I finally summoned the courage to go through my pile of old bills and begin paying back lenders, and am getting myself out of student loan default. I go to local concerts, restaurants, movies and the like at least weekly, and though I generally still need to be with someone I know/trust to go to social events, shopping alone is less anxiety-inducing, especially if I go during off-hours. I am prescribed Wellbutrin and Adderall, and feel well on most occasions if I take both consistently. I&amp;#39;d like to go back to therapy, because I&amp;#39;m not 100% better and minor setbacks (or even reading the news) still have the potential to send me into depressive episodes, but can&amp;#39;t quite afford that yet. Still, I&amp;#39;m far more optimistic, and &amp;quot;functional&amp;quot; as far as the societal norm goes, than I could have envisioned being this time two years ago. I hope reading this will help someone out there feel a bit more optimistic about their own life path as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested in what has worked for me:\n*Slowly building a network of friends/acquaintances based on mutual interests/life experiences/other friends, and using those relationships to feel comfortable in spaces they frequent (i.e. I&amp;#39;m friends with folks who work in a record store and a coffee shop, and go to those places if I want to go out but still feel &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot;). Staying isolated feels &amp;quot;safest&amp;quot; due to the way our minds work, but I WILL stagnate if I don&amp;#39;t make efforts to maintain contacts.\n*Finding a professional who will try different prescription combinations with you, including those that are &amp;quot;unconventional.&amp;quot; This is by no means a suggestion to illicitly obtain drugs, but for me, being prescribed Adderall (combined with Wellbutrin) was the only thing that lifted my depression.\n*Having a job, or hobbies that force me out of my house and into contact with a mostly-consistent, small set of people. I would suggest office jobs, animal services jobs, and other work that involves contact with a small team (who you don&amp;#39;t necessarily have to like, though it&amp;#39;s preferable) and a low volume of clients and staying the hell away from retail and food service. If you&amp;#39;re artistically inclined and in a well populated area, you could look into local drawing groups, reading or &amp;quot;niche&amp;quot; interest clubs.\n*Keeping myself busy, nearly all of the time, either with work, study or pleasure.

I just wish it&amp;#39;d be over already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Original thread for context:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/4yqfkh/driving_trip_for_work_next_week/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/4yqfkh/driving_trip_for_work_next_week/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wound up talking to the guy who&amp;#39;s going to be taking me and asked him if I could do it over the phone or Skype or something since it&amp;#39;s a relatively simple process and it seemed like having two people go would be redundant. He responded by saying that the timing with the button-pressing is fairly precise and that he needs someone to be able to show them exactly when to let go of a button when a command appears on the screen. I think he&amp;#39;s actually right, so I just kind of paused, didn&amp;#39;t say anything back, then nodded. So now it sounds like I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;needed&amp;quot; in this situation, and it will either be this upcoming week or next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, this signals the end of his final project, and now he is dropping the bomb on everyone that he is retiring after this is done. Lovely. So it can&amp;#39;t be any later than two weeks from now, because he won&amp;#39;t be around anymore after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried having my parents drive me around the neighborhood this weekend to attempt to get used to the feeling of being in the passenger seat, but I wound up eventually gasping for air a few times and my mom could tell even before that point that I was freaking out while sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I could tell him about my issue and ask him to give me the address so that I can drive myself. That would be much better, although I&amp;#39;d still have a panic attack. But at least I can pull over if I have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I could tell him more specifically that I have some agoraphobic symptoms and that I can&amp;#39;t go at all, but that seems like it&amp;#39;s literally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I talked to my therapist who basically said that I&amp;#39;m stronger than I think, and that I need to try to think back to my childhood when I was able to sit in the passenger seat of a car like it was no big deal. Apparently, I&amp;#39;m supposed to be able to get myself into the right frame of mind by thinking positively, bringing in memories from the past, and repeatedly telling myself that this will all pass and that it&amp;#39;s not the end of the world, and I can tell him to pull over if I have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fine, but that seems like a bit of a weak solution to a problem like this, right? Especially since I started gasping for air and hyperventilating while my mom drove me around this weekend. That doesn&amp;#39;t seem good at all for a trip like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you guys don&amp;#39;t have any further advice and that I&amp;#39;m screwed so I&amp;#39;m not sure why I&amp;#39;m writing this, but I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do. I&amp;#39;m terrified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: In the other thread, the consensus seemed to be to avoid the trip altogether and then work on the issue in  a more gradual way. I&amp;#39;d obviously love to do that, but it sounds like I&amp;#39;m too important to this trip.

I think I&amp;#39;m technically an &amp;quot;undiagnosed&amp;quot; agoraphobic in the sense that, although I have a therapist, the term &amp;quot;agoraphobia&amp;quot; has never come up specifically during our sessions. The definition that basically states that agoraphobics fear anxiety itself, or embarrassing situations, or situations difficult to get out of where panic attacks are likely to occur while one is feeling trapped, seems to best fit my condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not housebound, but I have very specific &amp;quot;areas&amp;quot; that are safe for me to drive to, including the office where I work. These &amp;quot;safe zones&amp;quot; seem to be constantly changing, depending on how often I&amp;#39;m going to certain places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sometimes have little tics that I give in to when I&amp;#39;m feeling incredibly anxious in situations where someone might notice that I&amp;#39;m anxious and I&amp;#39;ll feel embarrassed, or situations where I can&amp;#39;t immediately just get up and run away. For example, if an aisle at the grocery store has too many people in it or it just feels too &amp;quot;open,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ll quickly shake my head three times, clear my throat, then grab the back of my neck. This seems to &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; some really primal-feeling sense of imminent doom in my brain, but only temporarily. Luckily, in most situations, the sensation is extremely mild, and I&amp;#39;ve mostly conquered issues with public spaces like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That having been said, I still have two immense issues that I can&amp;#39;t see myself ever overcoming:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving over highways, bridges, and through tunnels. The longer that I&amp;#39;m on the highway, the more likely I am to feel like I&amp;#39;m going to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a passenger in a car while someone else drives, regardless of where we&amp;#39;re driving or how far it is to the destination. Again, the longer that the other person drives, the more &amp;quot;out of control&amp;quot; that I feel, and the more likely I am to freak out and try to find any way possible to get out of the car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue seems to be incredibly deep-rooted. It starts out as a general sense that I&amp;#39;m no longer in control and that if someone notices, things are going to go south very quickly. Then, over the course of several minutes, a strange, almost &amp;quot;hallucinated&amp;quot; sensation of a massive object being caught in my throat will start, along with a sense of my airways constricting. I guess I would refer to this as a &amp;quot;phantom lump.&amp;quot; Once the lump starts -- especially if someone else is driving -- no amount of my tics, whether they&amp;#39;re grabbing the car door handle three times, clearing my throat a certain number of times, wringing my hands, or whatever, will make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that will make the lump go away is getting out of the car, walking around, and being &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;back in control.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s literally as though my brain has a &amp;quot;switch&amp;quot; that causes it to enter an altered state of consciousness during the episode, and then my brain waves change back to something more &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; after the episode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the lump is there, every time I swallow, there is this really powerful sense of choking and dying, or maybe having almost like a surreal sense of not being connected to my body anymore. It&amp;#39;s kind of like that quick jolt of panic you get when you slip on a cliff&amp;#39;s edge and almost plummet to your death, except you don&amp;#39;t have anything to grab onto to calm you down -- you are now in &amp;quot;free fall,&amp;quot; and your tics don&amp;#39;t help you, anymore, because you&amp;#39;re not holding the steering wheel, which means that you can&amp;#39;t pull over, slow down, turn the wheel slightly, or do literally anything to give you that sense of control back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The need to grab onto something to prevent that feeling of choking or &amp;quot;leaving reality&amp;quot; will start cropping up during the drive every five minutes. Then, it&amp;#39;s every two minutes, then every minute, then every thirty seconds, until the next thing that I know, I have no choice but to make the driver pull over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried pulling out my phone and fiddling with it the whole time, not looking out the window, holding onto the car door -- you name it. It usually works for a little while, but it&amp;#39;s just a constant battle between me and my brain for control over my thoughts, and &amp;quot;my brain&amp;quot; always wins in the end while I&amp;#39;m in a car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, yeah, I think I need meds or something. I don&amp;#39;t know. But this brings me to next week: I have a job that USUALLY does not require any travel whatsoever, but because of an unusual circumstance, I have a big demo that I have to go to. I live in Baltimore and the demo is in Greenbelt, which is right by DC. The trip is going to take anywhere from 35-50 minutes, requires that I drive through the tunnel, and I&amp;#39;ll basically be terrified out of my mind while on the highway the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that the coworker I&amp;#39;m going with is absolutely insisting on not giving me the address, because &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;ll be easier&amp;quot; if he drives us both down there. So not only do I have to do some highway driving, but I&amp;#39;ll have to sit there helplessly in a constant state of feeling like my death is imminent for close to an hour, up and back, for a total of almost two hours of driving time. I obviously can&amp;#39;t just blurt out that I have driving anxiety, because that&amp;#39;s unfortunately very taboo in today&amp;#39;s world. I also can&amp;#39;t schedule an appointment at my therapist&amp;#39;s office with the nursing assistant there to get a prescription, because this came up on such short notice. I seem to have no choice but to go and bear this awful situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading. I am really just posting to see if anyone else has had to deal with a similar situation. Is there ANY chance that I can get out of this somehow and not have what will probably turn out to be the worst day of my year? Am I even agoraphobic? I guess I have some pretty intense OCD with panic disorder symptoms, so who knows. I seem to be all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for any replies! Anything at all would be helpful right now. I am seriously freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Something else that I should also add is that I will sometimes be fairly obvious while in the passenger seat. I might jump forward, gasp for air for a second, or flail my arms while trying to grab onto something to calm me down.

This is terrifying to me, because now it is up to me to mainly support the household and myself.  I am 21 years old.  I have no idea how i am going to be able to get a job. I have severe depression and anxiety. I have anxiety so bad when i am outside around people for too long, i start crying/ feel like i am losing my mind. I also have trauma especially from people insulting me and giving me dirty looks in the streets because they think i am ugly. This is my main fear, people treating me bad because of my appearance. This caused me isolate to myself from others and drop out of college for years because  of mistreatment of my looks. I do not want people looking at me. I don&amp;#39;t want to experience such horrible abuse from people again. Now I have to out into the cruel world with my ugly face and be prepared to face discrimination and possibly bullying all over again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am also scared I will mess it up. I had an opportunity to get hired a job near where I live, but i did not show up the next day because i got a panic attack and was not comfortable with how i looked. I tried to go back to apologize, they were upset/surprised at me but said it was ok and he would contact me in a very unsure tone and with disapproving look.He never did. Even if i could go back there, they will remember me and not trust me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel at this point, suicide would seem the only option for me.

I have severe depression and anxiety. I have anxiety so bad when i am outside around people for too long, i start crying/ feel like i am losing my mind. I also have trauma especially from people insulting me and giving me dirty looks in the streets because they think i am ugly. This is my main fear, people treating me bad because of my appearance. This caused me isolate to myself from others and drop out of college for years because  of mistreatment of my looks. I do not want people looking at me. I don't want to experience such horrible abuse from people again. Now I have to out into the cruel world with my ugly face and be prepared to face discrimination and possibly bullying all over again. \n\n\n\n\nI am also scared I will mess it up. I had an opportunity to get hired a job near where I live, but i did not show up the next day because i got a panic attack and was not comfortable with how i looked. I tried to go back to apologize, they were upset/surprised at me but said it was ok and he would contact me in a very unsure tone and with disapproving look.He never did.

I was just hoping for a little advice on my way. Any at all. \n\nAnd I can't be thankful enough for a safe space and great people to share these things with. No one is ever alone and I know that now.

I&amp;#39;m a 19 year old man who has been agoraphobic for the last 2 years. I was a completely normal teenager: I went to school, had tons of friends, went to parties, etc etc until I had a &amp;quot;traumatic&amp;quot; panic attack on vacation. I was so freaked out, and did everything I could not to have those scary feelings re-occur. It ended up with me being pretty much homebound. I could walk about 10 minutes away from my house, but that was it. I was terrified of being too far from home. (Luckily my high school was only about 5 minutes away from my home, so I did manage to complete school!)\nUnfortunately I completely stopped being with friends, and living a normal life. All I did when school finished was sit at home playing video games and talking to my friends over the internet. About 6 months in of being agoraphobic, I started doing some exposure therapy with my therapist. I did not dare trying to go too far from home with my exposure therapy, I mostly did small steps and was hoping that this would work. I did not get very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, this was pretty much my life for the last 2 years. Then, my therapist suggested meeting someone with more knowledge on CBT, and I was desperate to see my friends and go to school, so I thanked yes to this option.\nThis new therapist was a specialist in helping people with OCD, but as that is also an anxiety disorder, he pretty much knows exactly how agoraphobia/panic disorders work. Me and him made a 8 week scheme, where he was sure I would be completely cured from my panic disorder if I did it properly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me to make a list of things that I feared the most from top to bottom. On the top I wrote things like planes, trains, and being on a bus, to things that I feared less, but still gave me anxiety, like elevators. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first week I was with this man we went through how anxiety works on the human body. We also went through all the panic attack effects that scared me the most, and how it is not harmful for you. (I was terrified of suffocating from a panic attack, or that my heart was going to stop). The key thing that this man learned me was that anxiety always goes away. ALWAYS. I did not believe this back then, as I was completely sure that a panic attack could last forever if it wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this we started doing some intensive exposure therapy. We left my safety items at his office (my paper bag, phone, water, food) and decided that we were going to go on a freaking 20 minute train ride. This was on a [10] on the anxiety scale, and the thought of going on that train scared me so bad. I was completely sure that the panic attack was going to last all the way until I got back home. But guess what? It didn&amp;#39;t. I was terrified at the start, but the anxiety and panic always goes away. I consider knowing this the key to overcoming agoraphobia and panic disorder. \nTrust me, I know exactly what you&amp;#39;re thinking &amp;quot;But what IF the panic attack doesn&amp;#39;t go away&amp;quot;? Believe me, it does. That&amp;#39;s just how we are made. We have 2 nervous systems in our amygdala that controls the feeling of anxiety and the &amp;quot;anxiety scale&amp;quot; of how it goes up, and sooner or later, the anxiety will also go down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So pretty much, I kept forcing myself out every day besides thursdays, and did things that scared me, doing &amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot; that was over a [6] on the anxiety scale.

I am 23, female and am writing this because I feel I am reaching the end of my ability to cope and have no idea where to go from here. I need help and advice and feel as if i am not getting sufficient help from my doctor or support people. My life is at the lowest point ever and I am reaching out for the first time. I have been a long time sufferer (10+ years) of depression, anxiety and low self esteem. I have always been sensitive and had very strong empathy for others and their struggles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year I finally felt well enough to get off medication and the sickness benefit and try to get a\u00a0job. A year later I got a job as a customer service representative and I found it very hard emotionally. I worked for two months before eventually one day I picked up the headset, logged in and my stomach lurched when the call came in. I had to quickly transfer him to another css and run to the bathroom to be sick. I was sent home and the next time I tried to come into work the same thing happened.

I&amp;#39;m not sure why I never thought to do a search for such a group in the past. It probably could have been very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have always been an anxious person. I have always been afraid of everything. I have a very over active imagination that caused me to have night terrors as a child. But, I was always able to keep things in check and under my control. I also remember a period in my life where I lived carefree and there are many days that I miss that ability. The only problem was, the trade off meant I would be unhappy. I was always unhappy during those carefree days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Five years ago things took a turn for the worse. Things in my life all seemed to happen at once and I felt sick to my stomach all of the time. At first I didn&amp;#39;t know what was going on. It took some people I really cared for getting into a terrible car accident and me having a giant panic attack on the way to the hospital with my mother screaming at me that I would be fine, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;just a panic attack&amp;quot; for me to have a light bulb go off. It finally had a name. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The attacks became more frequent. I became unable to function in daily life. I locked myself in my bedroom and hid under the covers. (I should also point out that I was around 25 years old, and married. We had both lost our jobs in the economy crash and had to move in with my parents until we could get back on our feet. [Which was a start to all this anxiety.] So this whole ordeal wasn&amp;#39;t just affecting me, but my entire family. It&amp;#39;s funny to me, after being in therapy for almost two years, how easy it was to learn these scared behaviors when it&amp;#39;s absolutely one of the hardest things I have ever done to try to reverse this damage.) Enter agoraphobia. It came on slowly in some aspects, but so quickly in others. The more I tried to leave, the worse the panic attacks became. It got to the point where I was afraid of being afraid. A fear of fear. I was so embarrassed when I would have an attack in public. The way people would stare. It&amp;#39;s not like I was throwing up or shitting my pants (even though I felt I could.) It was more uncontrollable shaking and crying and the inability to catch my breath with my mother or someone with me trying to make excuses for my behavior. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly a year into my agoraphobic state, after many months of trying to find a doctor who could help me, to no avail,  I found out that I was pregnant. I wasn&amp;#39;t living for just me anymore. My husband called the closest women&amp;#39;s center which was an hour away. (We lived in the middle of nowhere.) He explained my predicament and they actually sent a prescription to our local pharmacy for a safe-ish anxiety medication that I could take while pregnant that would get me to them to have a check up. I remember the first time I took it. I could physically feel it pushing against the anxiety welling up in me. I was able to leave my home, my town, my prison for the first time in what seemed like forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew I was pregnant for nearly four weeks when I miscarried. It hurt. I cried. It still hurts. I remember turning to my husband and telling him that I couldn&amp;#39;t take this as a bad thing. I needed to take it for the good it brought us. I was able to get in and see a regular doctor. I was able to get put on different medications to get this under control and start to get my life back. It took a few tries to find something that worked for me but I always hated the way any medicine made me feel. I told my doctor that I wanted to learn skills to deal with this issue instead of masking it with medication. She was unable to help me and unable to direct me to a proper therapist that could. (Again, we lived in the middle of nowhere.) So, I decided to ditch all my medication for just a rescue medication. I would do this on my own if need be. I started house sitting for a friend. I was able to go places with my husband. Dinner, a movie, grocery shopping. You&amp;#39;d never believe how much I missed something as simple as grocery shopping.  I reached out to all my resources in search of some sort of therapist that would be able to help me. Time went by, my prescription got low, and my doctor refused to refill it. She needed me to come back in and I had no way to get there. We had one car. I couldn&amp;#39;t ride with anyone else at the time. I couldn&amp;#39;t drive with my medication. I felt unsafe leaving the house without my husband and he worked crazy hours at a place 45 miles away. My doctor wasn&amp;#39;t in town, it was a 20-30 minute drive to see her. The doctor in town was full and wouldn&amp;#39;t even take my call. I was slowly starting to regress back into my agoraphobia. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then my grandmother got sick. Her and I had this connection...I can&amp;#39;t even explain it. It was no secret in my family that I was her favorite. I was even named after her. She was my best friend. She was my confidant. She was the filler for all the holes my parent&amp;#39;s couldn&amp;#39;t provide filler for and there were a lot. It was cancer. It was everywhere. They took her to the hospital in the middle of August. On my mother&amp;#39;s birthday. We weren&amp;#39;t sure she was going to make it through the night. But, she did. She made it through my sister&amp;#39;s wedding September 1st, she made it through my niece&amp;#39;s birthday September 19th, and she died two days later. A month also shared by the deaths of her son and husband.  I had sat with her every day. . for hours. Some days in silence. Some days reading a book. Some days watching TV. We rarely talked in those days. The rest of the family was falling apart. They all began fighting. Neither of us could handle it. She would constantly tell them why she liked having me in the house vs. them due to the peacefulness of my presence. It got to the point where I couldn&amp;#39;t bear to see her in this state any longer. She was right before the morphine stage. She was in pain. She was scared. She could barely speak coherent sentences a lot of the time. My anxiety flared anytime I even thought of being with her. But, I tried. I would get there, burst into tears, and have to immediately leave. The last time I was there, she told me she loved me, a phrase that wasn&amp;#39;t given often in that house. I told her that I loved her as well and I left. It was the last thing we said to each other. It was the last time we saw each other. It should have been a beautiful memory for me. However, my aunt (a nurse) and uncle were angry that I was no longer sitting and watching my favorite person in the universe slowly die. They were angry because they would have to leave their time share an hour away to come and take turns sitting with her. They said to my mother that I should just be able to pop a pill and be fine. My mother&amp;#39;s retort was that she didn&amp;#39;t see their daughter sitting here watching her grandmother die. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family fell apart after she passed. There wasn&amp;#39;t a recent will and they all ended up being very selfish, money hungry people. People I didn&amp;#39;t know. The fighting was intense. My uncles were threatening my father (he was the executor of the will) with jail time, accusing him of stealing money that never existed, even threatened to get into a physical fight with him. They said terrible things about my mother, my sisters, and myself. Clearly my family is great at processing emotions. I can&amp;#39;t remember a time when my father aged so quickly. He looked sad, exhausted, and just. . .defeated. At this point, I was living in a constant state of anxiety. So, even though I had gotten up, showered, gotten dressed, and dragged myself downstairs, I couldn&amp;#39;t go to her funeral. I couldn&amp;#39;t be around them.  Not after the things they said and did. My husband went and recorded it for me on his phone. It was nothing that my grandmother would have wanted.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandmother&amp;#39;s passing left an opening at the local doctor&amp;#39;s office. I was given her spot. They were very accommodating. I used my last pills to drag myself into the office. They let me skip the waiting room and wait in the exam room usually used for children. I met my doctor and pretty much sat there crying while telling my story as she looked on with this face filled with pity. They set me up with a secure email system so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to go in every time there was an issue. They refilled my prescription. All of this was great except, I still couldn&amp;#39;t leave my home. Every time I attempted I would run into my &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; members. I was even shunned at one point in the post office. My uncle was standing there talking to some of his friends and when I entered he looked right at me and then turned his back to me and ignored my presence. That was when I stopped leaving my house all together.  My anxiety was so high that my medicine was barely taking the edge off. I retreated to my bed. There were days when I couldn&amp;#39;t even be around my sister and niece without having an attack. How does a 3 year old process that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally my sister who lived on the other side of the country got in touch with a friend she had gone to college with who was working in the mental health field. She provided me with a list of people who did therapy over video chat. My husband called a bunch on the list and they couldn&amp;#39;t help me for one reason or another. However, one lady, even though she couldn&amp;#39;t personally help me, gave my husband contact information for a new tele-health service in our state and after a few calls I was paired with a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed as having agoraphobia with panic attacks. I took on dialectical behavior therapy with my therapist. She has changed my life in so many ways. Eventually I learned enough skills to make it possible to be able to leave my room, then leave my house, then leave my yard. I went on short walks with my husband. I even got into the car. Getting into the car turned into short rides on the back streets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though I felt nowhere near ready, my husband and I decided to buy a house. He was able to do most everything without me and the loan officer was so accommodating to the point where he actually drove the hour to my parent&amp;#39;s house to do the closing paperwork with me. I never even saw the house in person. My husband took photos and we did a Skype tour every time he went to see it. I never even met the previous owners. But, still, the house felt right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, there I was. A homeowner who couldn&amp;#39;t seem to make it further than three streets from her parent&amp;#39;s house without having a panic attack. I started seeing my therapist twice a week. We started working really hard. We made a bunch of plans. My parents had left to drive across country to see my sister give birth to her first child and I felt as though I had to leave before they returned because their eyes on me would just make it so much harder. Plus, I didn&amp;#39;t want them to see if I failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t fail. All of our plans were well laid. Everything went smoothly. I actually found myself enjoying the ride. I was always one who had a love for traveling. My nephew was born on the day we closed on our house. Over 8 months have passed since that day. And while I am still having trouble leaving here as well, I have found that I have progressed in so many areas and I&amp;#39;m actually feeling happy again. I feel like I can breathe. There have been a few snags and setbacks here and there. Such as my insurance company auditing us because of my twice a week sessions. I was told that if I didn&amp;#39;t get into my car ASAP and go to a stressful family holiday, then I wasn&amp;#39;t trying hard enough and could no longer have twice a week sessions. But, I have to remember that the setbacks and the snags do not mean that I have failed or that I have to start all over again. I just had a bad week or a bad day. That happens to everybody. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I just thought it would be nice to let people know, that even though it&amp;#39;s a tough road ahead and a hell of a lot of work...it&amp;#39;s worth it. It does get better eventually. Even if it seems like it&amp;#39;s taking forever. It&amp;#39;s important to focus on the good things and feed energy to those good things and watch them blossom into even better things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, please know I&amp;#39;m always around to go into further detail if you have any questions. This is mostly a paraphrase of what went on. . . like a skimming of my life. Also, I&amp;#39;m here to just be a good listener. Sometimes that is all we need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;crossposted in &lt;a href=\"/r/Anxiety\"&gt;/r/Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey there fellow people with crazy pants hormones (that's what my therapist calls them.)\nI am new to this group.

I never even saw the house in person. My husband took photos and we did a Skype tour every time he went to see it. I never even met the previous owners. But, still, the house felt right. \n\nSo, there I was. A homeowner who couldn't seem to make it further than three streets from her parent's house without having a panic attack. I started seeing my therapist twice a week. We started working really hard. We made a bunch of plans. My parents had left to drive across country to see my sister give birth to her first child and I felt as though I had to leave before they returned because their eyes on me would just make it so much harder. Plus, I didn't want them to see if I failed.\n\nI didn't fail. All of our plans were well laid. Everything went smoothly. I actually found myself enjoying the ride. I was always one who had a love for traveling. My nephew was born on the day we closed on our house. Over 8 months have passed since that day. And while I am still having trouble leaving here as well, I have found that I have progressed in so many areas and I'm actually feeling happy again. I feel like I can breathe. There have been a few snags and setbacks here and there. Such as my insurance company auditing us because of my twice a week sessions. I was told that if I didn't get into my car ASAP and go to a stressful family holiday, then I wasn't trying hard enough and could no longer have twice a week sessions. But, I have to remember that the setbacks and the snags do not mean that I have failed or that I have to start all over again. I just had a bad week or a bad day. That happens to everybody. \n\nMostly, I just thought it would be nice to let people know, that even though it's a tough road ahead and a hell of a lot of work...it's worth it. It does get better eventually. Even if it seems like it's taking forever. It's important to focus on the good things and feed energy to those good things and watch them blossom into even better things. \n\nIf you've made it this far, please know I'm always around to go into further detail if you have any questions. This is mostly a paraphrase of what went on. . . like a skimming of my life. Also, I'm here to just be a good listener. Sometimes that is all we need.\n\nThank you for listening.  \n\n\ncrossposted in /r/Anxiety", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "4ny95a", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "New to group ~ Here's my story.

I always said that I wouldn&amp;#39;t wish agoraphobia onto my worst enemy, and that is true. Agoraphobia is a mental prison, and you think it&amp;#39;s a prison for life. Because once you have started into that abyss (fear of completely normal things), you think can&amp;#39;t unsee it. But I want to share my (long) story as it might help someone else. I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Background. I had the first panic attack at age 22. I noticed that before then I started feeling a little dizzy when outside running errands, but I blamed it on being tired, the heath, not eating much etc. At that time, I was in a unsatisfying relationship with someone who didn&amp;#39;t quite love me back.\nI moved countries for him, to Paris. We didn&amp;#39;t live together though, because of course this douchebag didn&amp;#39;t want to. A month after being there, he was getting cold feet and was talking about splitting up. Right after I had foolishly left my country and moved universities for him. We stayed together with ups and downs, but I just didn&amp;#39;t feel loved or supported. I felt emotionally alone and somewhat undeserving of my man&amp;#39;s love, unlike all my friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, one day, I took a morning after pill. Besides feeling physically unwell, the day after, I was walking in a local street when it kicked in. I can&amp;#39;t even write about this whole thing easily. Some memories are better off erased.\nI started to shake, needed something to lean on, was desperately wishing I was home. Everything was fuzzy. You know how it feels, I don&amp;#39;t need to say it. I managed to go home, and blamed it all on the crappy pill.\nNow, look at the circumstances. I was a loving woman who dreamed of having a satisfying relationship. I was dreaming of the time I could have a family of my own. I missed the town I came from, and I missed my parents, my friends. Whereas I found myself in an unloving relationship, far away from home in a hostile (and very unfriendly, have to say) big city because of someone who actually wanted to dump me, and most of all, I had taken the morning after pill (equals infertility, and feeling used) which was a big nonsense giving my desire for a family, given the right settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks after that incident, I started to realize that it was about time that I started to protect myself from that man&amp;#39;s emotional abuse. In that situation, only someone else&amp;#39;s love could have dragged me out of that relationship because I was so alone, with no friends and no family. I couldn&amp;#39;t do it myself.\nI started using myspace, and decided that man no longer needed respect or faithfulness from me, so I started talking to other people just like he did. And boom, I fell for someone online. He was perfection. We talked everyday, spent nights on the phone. His love healed me back into the streets, I forgot about that panic attack. Left that horrible boyfriend. I was confident, I was emotionally cherished. After 4 months, he came to visit me. \nTwo weeks before coming though, he had fallen out of touch, and agoraphobia became severe. I thought it was because of all the expectations and fear of not being good enough (he was a prom king type, I was just &amp;quot;undeserving me&amp;quot;). But now I see that it was because he had fallen out of touch, and I felt completely alone again. I had also been aggressed by a bum in the street, with a man watching without helping, and you can imagine how that devastated and scarred me in that sense.\nWe spent 10 days together. Everything was great, until the end of his stay, where I felt something off. I knew deep inside me that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen him again.\nAnd so it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst period I can remember. 2007 can burn in the deepest pit of hell. I had to finish my year at university, go to class, take exams, go grocery shopping, and I was a wreck. I was heartbroken, but agoraphobia was much worse than that. It was a new nightmare I didn&amp;#39;t even know existed. I lived alone and didn&amp;#39;t know how I could do anything to basically survive.\nYou know how hard it is to just tell people you have this thing. Friends, family. But when I finally went back home for the summer, I talked to my parents about it and was given medications by a psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to make this too long, but I spent three more years in Paris, as I had to finish my studies and found a job there. I was an agoraphobiac every single day. Still lived alone. Hardly ever went out, except for the supermarket down the road, and even that was a struggle on some days. Xanax always on my pocket was somehow my best friend at the time. Some other days were better. University/Work had somehow become familiar routes that I could reach by bus, and the bus stop was only across the road. Social life? Lol, well. The times I went out, I had friends picking me up, or sleeping over. Only dated online and met them closest possible to my apartment.\nThat&amp;#39;s not life when you are in your mid 20s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, I finally made the best decision of my life. Moving back home to my parents.\nThat probably sounded like a loser move to this &amp;quot;achievist&amp;quot; society. You are supposed to leave your small town, be independent, get a great job. You&amp;#39;re supposed to travel, and travel far. I was living in f___ing Paris, how could I move back to an old men&amp;#39;s town? People didn&amp;#39;t understand. It&amp;#39;s social media society, where everybody&amp;#39;s life is standardized and has to get a &amp;quot;like&amp;quot;.\nIt&amp;#39;s exactly when I stopped doing things for people, that I got my life back. I walked out of that mechanism, and listened to what &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; needed. I didn&amp;#39;t care what everybody else was thinking anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t easy to be back home and be without a life plan. But I needed that. I was tired being alone and isolated. I wanted to feel the love of my mother and father before it was too late. I wanted to pet my dog. My soul yearned for these basic things. I yearned for pure love. Not a man&amp;#39;s love. I was feeling better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you are ok with who you really are and stop responding to other people&amp;#39;s expectations, life will unfold itself in front of you. I met my SO online, and he was very different from all the urban hipsters I had encountered before. He wasn&amp;#39;t materialistic, didn&amp;#39;t take photos of his lunch, he was a small town person like me and we shared the same values. Both listened to 80s rock and metal, that was enough to disgust any parisian I knew. :)\nI didn&amp;#39;t look for someone with a great career because it would have impressed my friends. No. I finally searched &amp;amp; found the person I really wanted. He wanted children just as much as I did: and we didn&amp;#39;t wait much before becoming a family! This was my dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This, my friends, has healed me. And I feel at peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See how I was enduring in patterns that were &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; opposite to what my soul wanted. And I did that because I was expected to do certain things in order to be seen as successful. I thought that achieving someone else&amp;#39;s idea of a satisfactory life would have fixed mine. How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Agoraphobia is dreadful, and it&amp;#39;s normal that we see it as an enemy. The truth is that, you are producing it. You are creating a panic attack, as absurd as it can sound, it could be for your own good and you must wonder why. Listen to it. See the signs. Try to examine the circumstance in which it kicked in your life. Of course I cannot &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; that this works for everybody, but highly recommend this approach. Those were my root caused, yours will be different: try to honestly spot what you&amp;#39;d rather change in your life, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how uncool it sounds for others. Then go for it. Do the first step, don&amp;#39;t worry about fixing everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you begin feeling good, you can only attract more happiness.

Going outside and driving is ok because I like driving my car, but even thinking about walking around outside, going to the beach, forest or city feels painful, like I can never imagine myself doing any of that stuff again and I'm only really comfortable sitting around my house. Everything else; working, going shopping, nature walks, hanging out with friends, it all feels overwhelming and sends me into panic just thinking about it. I feel entirely alone and like I'm losing control of my life. Everything was going well too I have an amazing girlfriend and my job paid really well. Sucks.\n\nCan anyone help me?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "4d3h9n", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Suddenly overwhelmed, not sure what I should do or if I just have agoraphobia.

Not sure how many of you have been around for 6 years or so, but about that time I was part of a company called Soapier, and the reddit community helped my family&amp;#39;s business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was living in NYC. But prior to that I was in NYC in 2008 when the market crashed. I went down to Tampa to help with the family business, and 7 months later they couldn&amp;#39;t pay me anymore, so I went back to NYC, moved in with my gf, and had one hell of a time finding work. I was depressed, broke, I was dealing with a decade old anxiety problem, and the combination of it all put the zap on my head so badly, I was having a very hard time leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the things that had been bothering me (and that had gotten worse) was that my low blood sugar attacks were feeling like panic attacks, and visa versa. After a while, it was easier to just not leave the house. I was having full blown panic attacks walking two blocks to a grocery store... forget the subway, or seeing friends, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about seven months and I got a job with a company that I used to work for, and, long story short (too late), I had to force myself to go the job. Basically, I over ate every day just so I didn&amp;#39;t freak out. I gained about 30 pounds and about 10 months later said &amp;#39;fuck this, this is no way to live,&amp;#39; and quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was late 2010.

Not sure how many of you have been around for 6 years or so, but about that time I was part of a company called Soapier, and the reddit community helped my family's business.\n\nAt the time, I was living in NYC. But prior to that I was in NYC in 2008 when the market crashed. I went down to Tampa to help with the family business, and 7 months later they couldn't pay me anymore, so I went back to NYC, moved in with my gf, and had one hell of a time finding work. I was depressed, broke, I was dealing with a decade old anxiety problem, and the combination of it all put the zap on my head so badly, I was having a very hard time leaving the house.\n\nOne of the things that had been bothering me (and that had gotten worse) was that my low blood sugar attacks were feeling like panic attacks, and visa versa. After a while, it was easier to just not leave the house. I was having full blown panic attacks walking two blocks to a grocery store... forget the subway, or seeing friends, or anything else.\n\nFast forward about seven months and I got a job with a company that I used to work for, and, long story short (too late), I had to force myself to go the job. Basically, I over ate every day just so I didn't freak out. I gained about 30 pounds and about 10 months later said 'fuck this, this is no way to live,' and quit.\n\nThis was late 2010. A friend asked if I had any video experience, and I said 'sort of, I've got this camera and -'\n\nGreat! she said. With zero experience I filmed a couple of web episodes for her blog, and had a blast doing it.\n\nI met my now producing partner Julie during a season of APA pool league in NYC and we decided to re-tool a feature script of mine into a web series.

I learned to work with the anxiety and panic just through some talk therapy and things, it controlled me to a degree but it was very manageable. My agoraphobia started at the beginning of spring this year, I was dealing with some stressful life things and having sleep issues that were making my panic attacks and DPDR worse again. Then I woke up one day and felt extremely exhausted and was having really bad migraines and DPDR and having panic attacks constantly. I went to the doctor after a week and he diagnosed me with a sinus infection. Started treatment on an antibiotic and using a steroid nasal spray, steroids trigger panic attacks for me and I had a reaction to the antibiotic as well and the worst part was suffering through the antibiotic it didn&amp;#39;t even make me better. So I was sick for about nine weeks straight and during that time I kept having panic attacks while I was out of the house and and feeling horrible constantly and wanting to stay home because I couldn&amp;#39;t even function outside. I felt run down physically and mentally, it was horrible and I slowly withdrew inside more and more and disconnected from the world. I feel like I never really got better from the sinus infection and I assume that there might be a physical health issue causing the mental health issue because my problems seem to be more symptomatic but I&amp;#39;m also a hypochondriac so who knows, it mainly just bothers me I woke up a different person. Luckily I realized what was happening to me early because I had an uncle who was agoraphobic and that scared the shit out of me and I tried to start my own exposure and cognitive therapy to help myself and push myself. After four months from this all starting though I realized I couldn&amp;#39;t do it on my own anymore and so I started seeking help and got a CBT person to come to my house as well as a psychiatrist who gave me medicine (am too afraid to take them though because I basically have a medication phobia now).

I&amp;#39;m not too sure what the real purpose of me writing here is. I&amp;#39;m 29 years old and I haven&amp;#39;t left the house alone in 9 years. I spend most of the week in the house, I get out on weekends sometimes if possible... It&amp;#39;s painful just to write it down and acknowledge the reality of the situation. I&amp;#39;m a prisoner of myself, the last time I ever had a job was when i was 19, that was my first and only job. My problems started a year after I got married and we moved from a big city to the middle of nowhere shit town. I was 21 years old then. I got really bad depression and slowly entered this cycle of hell I can&amp;#39;t seem to get out of. We&amp;#39;ve moved a lot and either because of that or money or simply my mental issues, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to go to college. So fast forward years of medications, failed attempts at therapy and the horrible burden that I&amp;#39;ve been on my husband and myself. I am now 29 years old going on 30, no higher education, no work experience, no social life, serious anxiety disorders and struggling to keep depression at bay. I&amp;#39;m better today than I used to be, I can function and am not badly depressive. I&amp;#39;m trying hard to get better but the regrets are eating me alive. The anxiety of not having anything to show for myself after ALL these years, it&amp;#39;s pathetic really.... It&amp;#39;s just too much. I struggle to move forward because all these feelings of inadequacy and failure are destroying me. I can&amp;#39;t even drive because I can&amp;#39;t pass a driver&amp;#39;s test thanks to my anxiety. I feel paralyzed and i can&amp;#39;t get out of my own head. I&amp;#39;m trying to make efforts and move forward but I still spend each day alone in the house and it&amp;#39;s maddening. It&amp;#39;s like a curse because when I start feeling better and the depression starts to subside I get crushed by my inability to get out and do ANYTHING. I&amp;#39;m so bad I can&amp;#39;t even talk to people on the phone. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.\nSorry if this a super long post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; !!!: I want to start by saying to all of you here in this subreddit , regardless of whether you replied to me or not that I truly 100% feel so grateful this place exists. I hope this doesn&amp;#39;t come off as super sentimental or maybe even fake but, I Just want to thank you guys for all of your support. Every reply I&amp;#39;ve received from you has felt like a boost of energy I haven&amp;#39;t felt in so long. In the past 10 days I feel like I have accomplished so much, i feel like it&amp;#39;s scary silly how much better one can feel by just finding others that can relate to what you&amp;#39;re going through. I&amp;#39;m working really hard to push back the sad thoughts of all the things I haven&amp;#39;t done and at this point, i say &amp;quot; who cares &amp;quot; to them. What&amp;#39;s done is done, let&amp;#39;s focus on not being cruel to ourselves. I received so much kindness and support from all of you, it&amp;#39;s been so awesome... but i know we are much harsher and unforgiving towards ourselves, so really I wish i could send back all of the strength you guys have sent my way back to you. At least I know we&amp;#39;re not alone and that&amp;#39;s significant. Since I wrote this, I decided to give therapy another try. I don&amp;#39;t know that it will do miracles, but i&amp;#39;m giving it a try. I&amp;#39;ve started running every day and i really suck at it but i do 5 miles walking/running, my husband still has to do it with me obviously. I feel like it&amp;#39;s helped a lot with stabilizing my mood and keeps the anxiety at bay for longer throughout the day. I still haven&amp;#39;t really practiced any exposure really so it&amp;#39;s not technically real progress in the agoraphobia department, but I feel better mentally. I think it&amp;#39;s thanks to all of you. So again, Thank you!!! And sorry for all the cheesiness, it probably is coming off as a cross between the speech from brave heart and a beauty pageant queen who won a crown but that&amp;#39;s what you guys get! :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi, i decided to write because today is one of those days when the house is too quiet, silence is too loud and the loneliness is harder than usual to deal with. I'm not too sure what the real purpose of me writing here is. I'm 29 years old and I haven't left the house alone in 9 years. I spend most of the week in the house, I get out on weekends sometimes if possible... It's painful just to write it down and acknowledge the reality of the situation. I'm a prisoner of myself, the last time I ever had a job was when i was 19, that was my first and only job. My problems started a year after I got married and we moved from a big city to the middle of nowhere shit town. I was 21 years old then. I got really bad depression and slowly entered this cycle of hell I can't seem to get out of. We've moved a lot and either because of that or money or simply my mental issues, I wasn't able to go to college. So fast forward years of medications, failed attempts at therapy and the horrible burden that I've been on my husband and myself. I am now 29 years old going on 30, no higher education, no work experience, no social life, serious anxiety disorders and struggling to keep depression at bay. I'm better today than I used to be, I can function and am not badly depressive. I'm trying hard to get better but the regrets are eating me alive. The anxiety of not having anything to show for myself after ALL these years, it's pathetic really.... It's just too much. I struggle to move forward because all these feelings of inadequacy and failure are destroying me. I can't even drive because I can't pass a driver's test thanks to my anxiety. I feel paralyzed and i can't get out of my own head. I'm trying to make efforts and move forward but I still spend each day alone in the house and it's maddening. It's like a curse because when I start feeling better and the depression starts to subside I get crushed by my inability to get out and do ANYTHING. I'm so bad I can't even talk to people on the phone. I don't know what to do anymore.\nSorry if this a super long post.\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE** !!!: I want to start by saying to all of you here in this subreddit , regardless of whether you replied to me or not that I truly 100% feel so grateful this place exists. I hope this doesn't come off as super sentimental or maybe even fake but, I Just want to thank you guys for all of your support.

I could make it about 30 feet from my fence before the panic made me run back home.  But I decided that if I couldn&amp;#39;t get very far the least I could do was just stand outside and feel the fear for as long as I could. It worked. Day 2 I got ballsy and tried to cross the street, &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/SbuqShViGuE\"&gt;come, laugh at my obsessive counting of steps, swearing and running away in fear!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quit going outside for a few days after that happened, but I picked it up again. I pushed myself to the ends of the alley, then across the street (where I freak out in my video) and even down towards a corner a bit. Each day I just forced myself to go further and further until I got used to it. Sure, it takes a long time, but I moved from being able to walk a mile (1.6km) in an hour and five minutes (but only doing half that because it was unbearable) to expanding my time to about 60-90 minutes and almost 3 miles (4.8km). I can&amp;#39;t get too far yet, but holy shit I didn&amp;#39;t realize how far I&amp;#39;d come this last month watching that video.

Most people just look at me like &amp;quot;Oh, basic bitch&amp;quot; and go back to whatever they&amp;#39;re doing. Some people have asked me why I walk past their house halfway and turn back, I explain what&amp;#39;s what and they don&amp;#39;t bother me about it. The dogs don&amp;#39;t escape their fences, sometimes I fall (I literally tumbled down a hill the other day!) but I&amp;#39;m not dead. Every time I feel the panic rise I tell myself that 5 steps back is no safer than 5 steps forward, and that it&amp;#39;s okay to be afraid. I can walk 2-3 miles, I can walk half another block. Sometimes it gets so bad and I remind myself that I can just come back to this later and push against it then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last month I had a period where I didn&amp;#39;t go out for 10 days, because it was muddy and obviously that meant that I would sink to the bottom of something and die. So I waited it out until I realized that it&amp;#39;s the rainy season and I would either have to keep going now or wait to try again until next year. I opted to get muddy. It&amp;#39;s never too late to recapture your progress!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I can get about 2 blocks away from my house in one direction, and 1-1.5 blocks  in the other three directions. I force myself to cross streets at odd points so I don&amp;#39;t get locked into bullshit &amp;quot;safe zones&amp;quot; or only traveling in straight lines. I struggled for nearly the entire month to turn a corner, but I&amp;#39;ve been doing it all this week and it&amp;#39;s a lot less scary now.

I couldnt go outside for a very long time. My parentd were supportive and tried to help me. I always knew that it was only me who can get me out of this. Since I know that this fear is only a placeholder for something else. In my case living on my own and being a man. \nNow, the biggest thing that holds me back is going outside during the night. I worked last year for amazon and got offered to do morning shifts only. But I didnt do it. I worked there half a year and I got back up. I felt strong. Then december came (worked there 6  months). I wasnt the best employ and I was sure they wouldnt keep me. But still it hit me. I was sure I wouldnt fall back to what I was. This little pathetic guy who always backs away from his fear.

Im about to do something im afraid of and need some helpful words.\nTo me: Im 23 years old, wheigh to much and still with my mom. I live in fear since im 19. I couldnt go outside for a very long time. My parentd were supportive and tried to help me. I always knew that it was only me who can get me out of this. Since I know that this fear is only a placeholder for something else. In my case living on my own and being a man. \nNow, the biggest thing that holds me back is going outside during the night. I worked last year for amazon and got offered to do morning shifts only. But I didnt do it. I worked there half a year and I got back up. I felt strong. Then december came (worked there 6  months). I wasnt the best employ and I was sure they wouldnt keep me. But still it hit me. I was sure I wouldnt fall back to what I was. This little pathetic guy who always backs away from his fear.

My mother passed away when I was 5 to septicaemia and I have never really known my real father. When I was born my real father decided to leave my mother, she found a new partner just before I was born and I was brought up and told he was my real father. She passed away and I was left in the care of the guy who I thought was my father.\nSome few years later he found a woman and started dating her, they became close and sooner or later got engaged and moved into a new house with myself. Around the age of 9 I was brought downstairs one morning and my &amp;quot;stepfather&amp;quot; explained to me that he wasnt my biological father and that my real father had left my mother before I was born... After that moment life changed for me I started being less interested in anything they had to say as my mind told me they were worthless to me? Not blood related just strangers really even though he had brought me up for 4 years after my mother had passed away... Well my behaviour towards my stepfathers new partner became worse also.. my stepfather used to work late nights to the early morning so I&amp;#39;d ignore orders from his new parnter and create chaos basically even at a young age.. Randomly one day my stepfathers new partner wanted to go to her mothers after I had finished school but I couldn&amp;#39;t take it I just snapped and started going ballistic at her at how much time we had to spend at her mums when I fucking hated it there. So I told her for the first time that I hated going to her mums and it annoyed the shit out of me... yet we still went that day and she decided to tell her mother what I said about her calling her names etc. My stepfathers partner also phone called my stepfather from work and told him he had to come and see to me even though he was suppose to be working as a mechanic on the road(AA) in the UK. He arrived at her mothers and started shouting at me and dragged me into his van explaining whats wrong with me and why my behaviour has become so terrible towards his partner... so he took me home just me and him and we sat down in the front room and said to me &amp;quot;Do you want to live here anymore?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You need to decide if you do or don&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; So I replied literally within a second and said &amp;quot;No I want to go live with my mothers father(Grandfather) so I was told to ring him and see what could be done.. after that phone call I have been living with my grandfather since then(Age of 10-24) But now I&amp;#39;m starting to have a really difficult time in life... housebound for 2 years, Severe Depression, Social Anxiety, Self-Harm(Attempted suicide 4 times) And I&amp;#39;m for some reason wanting to reconnect with my stepfathers partner and I don&amp;#39;t know why... I used to hate her back when I was younger but now I&amp;#39;m thinking about it I want to hug her and talk with her and ask for help but I haven&amp;#39;t seen them properly since I was 10 years old.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this I know its long but I wanted people to know my mini life story I guess... comments appreciated &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm a 24 year old male with a history of Agoraphobia and Severe Depression for the past 2 years while also gaining 10+ stone in them 2 years.. while also being housebound. My mother passed away when I was 5 to septicaemia and I have never really known my real father. When I was born my real father decided to leave my mother, she found a new partner just before I was born and I was brought up and told he was my real father. She passed away and I was left in the care of the guy who I thought was my father.\nSome few years later he found a woman and started dating her, they became close and sooner or later got engaged and moved into a new house with myself. Around the age of 9 I was brought downstairs one morning and my \"stepfather\" explained to me that he wasnt my biological father and that my real father had left my mother before I was born... After that moment life changed for me I started being less interested in anything they had to say as my mind told me they were worthless to me? Not blood related just strangers really even though he had brought me up for 4 years after my mother had passed away... Well my behaviour towards my stepfathers new partner became worse also.. my stepfather used to work late nights to the early morning so I'd ignore orders from his new parnter and create chaos basically even at a young age..

Black mold was terrible in the basement and I've never placed the two together. After researching black mold it does lead to mental issues. What if it isn't me and just the environmental conditions! This is great news in a way, we are currently looking into ways to relocate although it will be difficult because our home is paid off and we are tight on funds due to his back disability and my mental. I just wanted to share this. I'll post again in the future if things change with living conditions and my mental state.

Now i am conserned about my future, why did it happen to me etc. I feel like a lion in a cage so to speak. I believe that this is common to most panic disorder people. But is it? \n\nOne doctor that i visited told me that this is ocd. I replied that i have no compulsions and second i dont obsess about killing someone, dirt, checking things etc. I worry a lot cause i am immobilized. Thats all. \n\nSo i want to ask you how you are at home. Do you worry about your condition? I dont worry all the time of course. There are times that i forget about it and there are times that i am too overwhelmed emotionally by my negative thoughts that i feel some panicky feelings even in my home.\n\nI believe that we all feel that way but since i dont know many people with this disorder, i wanted to ask here.

I feel like I'm keeping him from doing things he wants to do, when he wants to do them. It's rare since he is also pretty just wanting to be home. But I still feel bad if I cant go to a game store or bookstore when the urge strikes. \n\nIs it normal not to feel hindered by agoraphobia?\n\nTL:DR I love my life as an agoraphob except when I have to leave my home...Normal?

When I quit the job, I felt like I would never find a job again because I was too inept or immature (agoraphobia still makes me feel like this; it's such a self-esteem killer).\n\n\n**Spring 2015**\n\n-I am still taking classes, and getting all A's so far. \n\n-I've been sleeping too late because of homework and financial stress and other stress in general. \n\n-Dated the guy I met in the summer for two weeks. He stopped contacting me after I told him about my agoraphobia and saw my self harm scars. I might have done something to scare him off, but oh well.\n\n-I attended the cherry blossom festival in San Francisco last weekend and I didn't have a panic attack at all. My two friends came with me. \n\n\n**TL;DR**: Currently getting hired as a Pharmacy Tech and am afraid of messing things up because I have failed some opportunities in the past due to agoraphobia.
