I don't get nearly the same level of stress as I did at high school, and I don't feel the compulsions to the same levels as I did though they are still there.\n\nSo back to the question: I was having a bit of an argument with my sister the other week, and she hit me with a bit of a low blow \"Yeah well you need to get over your OCD!\" (the argument actually had nothing to do with mental health or OCD, but that's beside the point).\n\nThis really got me thinking, if my OCD is still there, but it doesn't interfere with my life in the same manner it used to, and for the forseeable future it won't effect me, do I really need to go through treatment for it?\n\n(sorry for the wall of text!)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ib86h", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Do I need to confront my OCD?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": true, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7ib86h", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7ib86h/do_i_need_to_confront_my_ocd/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512724544.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7ib86h/do_i_need_to_confront_my_ocd/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Bosunny_Delight", "created_utc": 1512695744.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have OCD since when I was about 9 years old and did not know it was OCD when I was 12 years old I discovered what OCD was and I am the reason I washed my hand every moment was because of it and that sucks.

Apologies in advance for the length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some compulsions in regard to my OCD, but for me it&amp;#39;s mainly obsessive thoughts (checking, rechecking, etc.). I focus on anything concerning mental and physical health Ever since I was little, (like even before kindergarten) I was worried about everything concerning health. For example, in grade school, I had it in my mind that I &amp;quot;saw slanted&amp;quot; so like, I would look down a hallway or in front of me and saw everything tilting. I went to the eye doctor and a specialist and they didn&amp;#39;t find anything wrong with me. I also had an optical migraine twice in grade school as well where it covered most of my vision for a bit. That sent me into a panic for years. I gradually developed floaters as well, but learned to live with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been worried I had leukemia, cancer, MS, etc. In terms of mental health, ever since I saw a documentary about schizophrenia in high school (I&amp;#39;m now in law school, so it&amp;#39;s been such a long time!), I&amp;#39;m convinced I&amp;#39;m going to develop it and have even &amp;quot;heard&amp;quot; things to some extent. It&amp;#39;s like when a phone rings and then stops and you still hear it. I&amp;#39;ve had that with birds chirping, crickets, cicadas, loud thoughts, etc. It comes in phases of a few weeks then disappears. I&amp;#39;ve also had obsessive thoughts about death (fear of) that never went away for 2 months while I was abroad. There&amp;#39;s much, much more and it&amp;#39;s exhausting, so this was the LAST thing I need, especially before finals. I&amp;#39;m also on Lexapro, but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be helping in this situation. I don&amp;#39;t get to see my therapist till the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to the reason I&amp;#39;m asking for advice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days ago I was on the way home from a road trip when I fell asleep in the car. I don&amp;#39;t remember waking up, but remember being at a stoplight and seeing snow around me. I asked my boyfriend if it was snowing and he said no. I started panicking, worrying the &amp;quot;snow&amp;quot; wouldn&amp;#39;t go away. I don&amp;#39;t really remember if I is saw what I&amp;#39;m seeing now in terms of &amp;quot;misting,&amp;quot; though, which is tripping me up.

It&amp;#39;s like diagonal mist that looks likes it falling. I&amp;#39;ve been online (been told not to, but saw something about visual snow. this doesn&amp;#39;t help me because I&amp;#39;m worried it&amp;#39;ll get worse and worse till I go blind). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the optometrist yesterday and told him this.

I just don&amp;#39;t believe him. What if he&amp;#39;s just guessing at this? What if he missed something? Plus Optometrists don&amp;#39;t know much about eye diseases.

Like can it actually make me see this stuff? I always have a hard time believing anxiety can manifest these types of symptoms (physical).  I guess I don&amp;#39;t know when I should be concerned v. not concerned. I keep on checking to see if it&amp;#39;s still there and it always is, even when I don&amp;#39;t think about it. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s getting worse or if it&amp;#39;s always been there. I can&amp;#39;t focus on anything but this and can&amp;#39;t stop crying when I see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: grammar&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi there.\n \nJust some history for my anxiety/OCD. Apologies in advance for the length.\n\nI have some compulsions in regard to my OCD, but for me it's mainly obsessive thoughts (checking, rechecking, etc.). I focus on anything concerning mental and physical health Ever since I was little, (like even before kindergarten) I was worried about everything concerning health. For example, in grade school, I had it in my mind that I \"saw slanted\" so like, I would look down a hallway or in front of me and saw everything tilting. I went to the eye doctor and a specialist and they didn't find anything wrong with me. I also had an optical migraine twice in grade school as well where it covered most of my vision for a bit. That sent me into a panic for years. I gradually developed floaters as well, but learned to live with those.\n\nI've also been worried I had leukemia, cancer, MS, etc. In terms of mental health, ever since I saw a documentary about schizophrenia in high school (I'm now in law school, so it's been such a long time!), I'm convinced I'm going to develop it and have even \"heard\" things to some extent. It's like when a phone rings and then stops and you still hear it. I've had that with birds chirping, crickets, cicadas, loud thoughts, etc. It comes in phases of a few weeks then disappears. I've also had obsessive thoughts about death (fear of) that never went away for 2 months while I was abroad. There's much, much more and it's exhausting, so this was the LAST thing I need, especially before finals. I'm also on Lexapro, but that doesn't seem to be helping in this situation. I don't get to see my therapist till the end of December.\n\nSo back to the reason I'm asking for advice:\n\nTwo days ago I was on the way home from a road trip when I fell asleep in the car. I don't remember waking up, but remember being at a stoplight and seeing snow around me. I asked my boyfriend if it was snowing and he said no. I started panicking, worrying the \"snow\" wouldn't go away. I don't really remember if I is saw what I'm seeing now in terms of \"misting,\" though, which is tripping me up. I have had hallucinations when I'm half asleep, which I've been told by my therapist is normal.\n\nSo, we stopped at a gas station and whenever I looked in the distance at darker spots (like trees or windows) it looked like it was misting. I clearly knew it wasn't. So I've been in a panic for the past few days now about this. So far, it's only when I look outside at darker spots. It's like diagonal mist that looks likes it falling. I've been online (been told not to, but saw something about visual snow. this doesn't help me because I'm worried it'll get worse and worse till I go blind). \n\nI went to the optometrist yesterday and told him this. He said my astigmatism had gotten worse and I now need glasses. He said that is probably the reason I'm seeing this \"mist\" when I look at dark spots outside. I just don't believe him. What if he's just guessing at this? What if he missed something? Plus Optometrists don't know much about eye diseases.

I hope you all have a happy holiday.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i37fr", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Self-sabotage and stress-related OCD", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7i37fr", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7i37fr/selfsabotage_and_stressrelated_ocd/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512641839.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7i37fr/selfsabotage_and_stressrelated_ocd/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Tishbite", "created_utc": 1512613039.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My native language isn&amp;#39;t english, so i apoligize in advance for any mistakes.

They also have to be long clothes, as in, a hoodie for example to make sure my arms won&amp;#39;t touch anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After having been downstairs, i &amp;quot;have&amp;quot; to do certain things before using my computer again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always wash my feet.\nI wash my hands, using dish cleaning liquid, then normal soap, then dish washing liquid again. Then i wash my face, counting to a certain number, and then i clean my hands again just like before.\nAfterwards when i enter my room i use little wet wipes that are for glasses, to clean my arms, once again counting to a certain number. I also use them to clean my hands, counting to a certain number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of the physical symptoms i have are centerd around me making sure everything feels and is right before i use the computer, but alot of the symptoms show even when i know i wont use it that day. So basically me wanting to use the computer &amp;quot;reinforces&amp;quot; these symptoms and makes them worse.\nFor example when i know i&amp;#39;m about to do something i really like on the computer, it gets even worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, alot of symptoms show even when i know i won&amp;#39;t use the computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever i shower knowing i will use the computer it takes me between 1h-2h. Usually 1h 30mins. When i shower knowing i won&amp;#39;t use it, it still takes me 30-45 mins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wash my hands multiples times a day and when i wash them, i wash more than once. As in: Take soap-wash, take soap-wash. I usually count to a certain number. I also use dish cleaninh liquid because it degreases the hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to clean the chair before sitting down at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After taking a dump i have to clean myself to the point where i start bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i am outside and stand up from a chair i repeatedly check if i dropped something before leaving the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, all troughout the day i keep remembering unpleasent memories from the past, even back to when i was a little child and they make me anxious and just feel uncomfortable. I very often have these thoughts when i do my &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; which leads me to repeat the routine from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now to the &amp;quot;will this help&amp;quot; part.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically today i wanted to use the computer, so i wanted to shower etc. However earlier today i was in a fight with my parents which made the unpleasant thoughts even worse. I just couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to take a shower because i felt like even if i was going to use the computer i wouldn&amp;#39;t enjoy it the way i usually would. This almost lead me to just say &amp;quot;f@&amp;amp;k it&amp;quot; and use it without doing any of my &amp;quot;cleaning&amp;quot;. Well, not really, but i played with the thought for quite some time. I thought that this might be a huge step to fix my ocd, but i just coulen&amp;#39;t bring myself to do it.

I was seeking constant reassurance and ruminating every single minute of the day, googling every single thing I did for hours to the point where I wasn&amp;#39;t getting work done. I was obsessed about my feelings and whether they were &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; and trying to understand them and make the perfect decision.

It&amp;#39;s not germaphobia exactly.

This happens with foods that aren&amp;#39;t oily or sticky either, like bread. A big one I don&amp;#39;t like touching is fruits like bananas, which have a strong scent and can smear onto your fingers and other objects which continue to carry that scent.

It's not germaphobia exactly. My problem is that I don't like touching food and then touching other objects, such as my phone, laptop keyboard, clothes, steering wheel of my car, etc. I feel like the oils or scents from food items are going to end up onto these other objects, making them oily, sticky, or smelly. This happens with foods that aren't oily or sticky either, like bread. A big one I don't like touching is fruits like bananas, which have a strong scent and can smear onto your fingers and other objects which continue to carry that scent.

I find it extremely difficult to recall an event by date and things that happened last week I seem to recall being months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways I have a wonderful boyfriend whom I am getting engaged to and moving in with in a few months. I&amp;#39;m extremely excited to finally begin our lives and move out I think about it 24/7 and I&amp;#39;m desperately counting down the days&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here is the thing. I had a 2 close friends about 2 (almost 3?) Years ago . One was a lady and another a gay man. I am no longer friends with the female and I&amp;#39;m unsure about the male. He moved away and doesn&amp;#39;t really reach out to me. Anyways I have a memory that about those 2-3 years ago I sent then a topless Snapchat of myself.  I don&amp;#39;t known why I would? Maybe it was a joke. I also believe that it may have just been me in a bra. I just do not know. I was with my bf at the time. I remember telling him &amp;quot;Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t send (male friend) those pictures haha&amp;quot; after I realized it was in appropriate.  I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with this so so so much these last few days. I would never cheat on my bf and the thought of another man make a me feel sick but idk I feel like my friends might have gotten the picture somehow and will send it to my bf and he will break up with ne. The thought is devastating.  The memory feels so real!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know if that really happened.... I mean why would i send a topless picture out of myself? I might have sent the bra one out and send it to my gay friend by mistake? Ugh I feel sick as if I cheated on my bf or something.  He knows something is wrong as I&amp;#39;m quiet around him. When he tells me he loves me I feel sick and like I want to cry. In my memory I think he might know I sent them?\nI&amp;#39;m lossing sleep over this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel fucking crazy so I can&amp;#39;t talk to anyone about this.\nHas anyone else had false memories?

The thoughts keep me up at night which sucks because I\u2019m a college student and my classes are early in the morning so I\u2019m constantly tired and lack sleep. I regret watching the gay porn because now whenever the thoughts get really bad those images pop into my head. I even asked myself if there was a possibility that I might be bisexual but I don\u2019t think I can be because I\u2019ve never been and still not sexually attracted to guys, but even though I know that, my brain keeps saying \u201cyou never know, you\u2019re probably gay/bisexual\u201d. I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to anyone about this without them thinking I\u2019m gay and in denial. I think if I were gay or bisexual I would\u2019ve accepted or I would have an urge to be with a man. I don\u2019t know, the thoughts have been a lot worse these past few weeks and I\u2019ve seriously contemplated suicide because that\u2019s the only way to make them stop permanently. I\u2019m sorry this is so badly written but I needed to get this out. I just want the thoughts to stop. Deep down I know I\u2019m straight, but my mind won\u2019t let me be at peace with that.

It is a brain glitch and basically your brain is malfunctioning. You may find yourself constantly asking people for reassurance that something is OK or something didn&amp;#39;t happen. Asking people for reassurance is like a drug, the more you get the more you keep needing more. This creates an endless cycle that keeps making the problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote this not to talk about my battle. I wrote this in hope it finds someone who may be struggling with OCD and/or depression looking for some kind of support; a place I have been before. I have endured three major episodes of OCD coupled with severe depression and suicidality. I have used drugs as a way to feel happy and overcame addiction. I want you to get the help you deserve and understand you can get better the right way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of depression I am a rational functioning member of society. When my OCD and depression got out of hand it made very little sense to me. I can understand why it was hard for others to understand because OCD is not rational. Again, your brain is malfunctioning and no amount of trying hard or talking to yourself will make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can beat OCD. You can beat depression. It doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight and won&amp;#39;t happen without help. You can find a therapist who understands OCD here: &lt;a href=\"https://iocdf.org/find-help/\"&gt;https://iocdf.org/find-help/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you are trying to find a therapist, they should be well educated in exposure response prevention which is the gold star treatment for OCD. Exposure response prevention is an evidence based treatment that makes you confront your fears. For example, if you are afraid you hit someone in your car and find yourself thinking endlessly about what-ifs, watching the news for hit and run accidents, or driving around the block endlessly, you do the opposite. You record yourself depicting the worse case scenario where you did kill someone and you listen to it endlessly. Your anxiety will spike but in time it will come down. Maybe you listen to it while you drive and don&amp;#39;t check what every bump in the road is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exposure response prevention is designed to bore the brain. Think of getting in a cold pool. At first the water is freezing but as you stay in the pool longer, your body acclimates to the temperature and the water begins to feel warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OCD finds that grey area in uncertainty and creates havoc and torture in your mind. Having OCD doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are a weak person or aren&amp;#39;t strong because you can&amp;#39;t dispense of the irrational thoughts. If you&amp;#39;re dealing with OCD I&amp;#39;d say it actually makes you a strong person. You&amp;#39;re battling something that very few people understand and unless they experienced it, will never fully grasp. OCD sucks the joy out of your life and makes you feel like you deserve no happiness because you&amp;#39;re the worst person in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Human beings do not really have control of what comes in their head. The problem with people who suffer from OCD, our brains get stuck in a loop we are unable to stop. Unfortunately, the more we try to suppress or control our thoughts, the worse it gets. Think of your thoughts as leaves flowing freely down a river. We want them to continue on, acknowledge them and move on. With OCD, our thoughts get clogged and bunched up and before we know it, the river has stopped flowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with therapy, medication can help OCD. While meeting with a behavior therapist, you may want to inquire about a psychiatrist. Medications known as select serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help. I found SSRIs to be like training wheels which help give you a window of opportunity to engage in ERP to beat OCD. SSRIs help slow down the ferocity and speed the constant obsessive thoughts occur. Again, OCD is a brain glitch and medication is sometimes necessary to correct this biological imbalance in your brain along with the correct therapy. Sometimes SSRIs are combined with atypical anti-psychotic drugs like Seroquel to help OCD further. I do not believe medication alone is a magic bullet; it is a piece of the puzzle. You have to engage in the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favor and don&amp;#39;t read the reviews online for different medications. I found myself discouraged by what a lot of people wrote online about Lexapro when I first started taking it. I wanted assurance it was going to work but was unable to find it. The truth is most people who write online about medications are ones who are understandably upset about one particular drug not working. Maybe the first medication didn&amp;#39;t work for them. Maybe another one did. I had to try a couple different ones before finding the right one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people who find a medication that works, by the time they find themselves feeling better, are out enjoying life and not writing online positive things about it. Medication takes 3 months at the right dosage. ERP success doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight. During your recovery, you have to remind yourself that healing is not linear. You will have good moments and bad, bad days and good days. It&amp;#39;s like the change of seasons from winter to spring. It&amp;#39;s not immediately hot; it&amp;#39;s cold one day, then warm, then eventually hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With OCD, the content of your obsessions is irrelevant. You can be worried about germs, harming others, not shutting off the oven, or being a pedophille; it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. These thoughts are all spam flying through your head and talking through the obsessions or analyzing them won&amp;#39;t help. It&amp;#39;s all garbage your brain is incorrectly alerting you to. Your fight or flight system has gone awry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of OCD as a separate entity; it is something that exists separate of your healthy brain. OCD will do everything possible to find what bothers you the most and do its best to stay alive in that grey area of uncertainty. OCD screams at you it needs certainty. Truth is, it doesn&amp;#39;t. OCD is a bully that does a great job being loud and the center of attention so it&amp;#39;s understandable it&amp;#39;s impossible to believe otherwise. However, by challenging OCD the right way, you can defeat it and live a happy life. Even if you found certainty to your current obsession, OCD would just move on to something else and torture you that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with OCD, I also had severe depression. I found behavioral activation helpful. Behavioral activation is basically forcing yourself to do things. Depression will make you feel like all you want to do is sleep or sit in a dark room and not speak to anyone, eat anything, or enjoy anything you once did. I found behavioral activation, along with Lamotrigine very helpful. Again, success doesn&amp;#39;t happen overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my depression got really severe, I found electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) extremely helpful. ECT is a small brief seizure you experience while asleep which helps &amp;quot;reboot&amp;quot; the brain. Don&amp;#39;t believe the scary nonsense online about ECT if you are considering it for severe depression. Thousands of people undergo ECT every year to successfully overcome their medication resistant depression. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OCD is a bully. The only way to beat it is to knock the bully out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:info@webeatocd.com\"&gt;info@webeatocd.com&lt;/a&gt; - Want to ask me a question? Speak to me directly?

I have endured three major episodes of OCD coupled with severe depression and suicidality. I have used drugs as a way to feel happy and overcame addiction. I want you to get the help you deserve and understand you can get better the right way.\n\nOutside of depression I am a rational functioning member of society. When my OCD and depression got out of hand it made very little sense to me. I can understand why it was hard for others to understand because OCD is not rational. Again, your brain is malfunctioning and no amount of trying hard or talking to yourself will make it go away.\n\nYou can beat OCD. You can beat depression. It doesn't happen overnight and won't happen without help. You can find a therapist who understands OCD here: https://iocdf.org/find-help/\n\nWhen you are trying to find a therapist, they should be well educated in exposure response prevention which is the gold star treatment for OCD. Exposure response prevention is an evidence based treatment that makes you confront your fears. For example, if you are afraid you hit someone in your car and find yourself thinking endlessly about what-ifs, watching the news for hit and run accidents, or driving around the block endlessly, you do the opposite. You record yourself depicting the worse case scenario where you did kill someone and you listen to it endlessly. Your anxiety will spike but in time it will come down. Maybe you listen to it while you drive and don't check what every bump in the road is.\n\nExposure response prevention is designed to bore the brain. Think of getting in a cold pool. At first the water is freezing but as you stay in the pool longer, your body acclimates to the temperature and the water begins to feel warm.\n\nOCD finds that grey area in uncertainty and creates havoc and torture in your mind. Having OCD doesn't mean you are a weak person or aren't strong because you can't dispense of the irrational thoughts. If you're dealing with OCD I'd say it actually makes you a strong person. You're battling something that very few people understand and unless they experienced it, will never fully grasp. OCD sucks the joy out of your life and makes you feel like you deserve no happiness because you're the worst person in the world.\n\nHuman beings do not really have control of what comes in their head. The problem with people who suffer from OCD, our brains get stuck in a loop we are unable to stop. Unfortunately, the more we try to suppress or control our thoughts, the worse it gets. Think of your thoughts as leaves flowing freely down a river. We want them to continue on, acknowledge them and move on. With OCD, our thoughts get clogged and bunched up and before we know it, the river has stopped flowing.\n\nAlong with therapy, medication can help OCD. While meeting with a behavior therapist, you may want to inquire about a psychiatrist. Medications known as select serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help. I found SSRIs to be like training wheels which help give you a window of opportunity to engage in ERP to beat OCD. SSRIs help slow down the ferocity and speed the constant obsessive thoughts occur. Again, OCD is a brain glitch and medication is sometimes necessary to correct this biological imbalance in your brain along with the correct therapy. Sometimes SSRIs are combined with atypical anti-psychotic drugs like Seroquel to help OCD further. I do not believe medication alone is a magic bullet; it is a piece of the puzzle. You have to engage in the work.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't read the reviews online for different medications. I found myself discouraged by what a lot of people wrote online about Lexapro when I first started taking it. I wanted assurance it was going to work but was unable to find it. The truth is most people who write online about medications are ones who are understandably upset about one particular drug not working. Maybe the first medication didn't work for them. Maybe another one did. I had to try a couple different ones before finding the right one.\n\nMost people who find a medication that works, by the time they find themselves feeling better, are out enjoying life and not writing online positive things about it. Medication takes 3 months at the right dosage. ERP success doesn't happen overnight. During your recovery, you have to remind yourself that healing is not linear. You will have good moments and bad, bad days and good days. It's like the change of seasons from winter to spring. It's not immediately hot; it's cold one day, then warm, then eventually hot.\n\nWith OCD, the content of your obsessions is irrelevant. You can be worried about germs, harming others, not shutting off the oven, or being a pedophille; it doesn't matter. These thoughts are all spam flying through your head and talking through the obsessions or analyzing them won't help. It's all garbage your brain is incorrectly alerting you to. Your fight or flight system has gone awry.\n\nThink of OCD as a separate entity; it is something that exists separate of your healthy brain. OCD will do everything possible to find what bothers you the most and do its best to stay alive in that grey area of uncertainty. OCD screams at you it needs certainty. Truth is, it doesn't. OCD is a bully that does a great job being loud and the center of attention so it's understandable it's impossible to believe otherwise. However, by challenging OCD the right way, you can defeat it and live a happy life. Even if you found certainty to your current obsession, OCD would just move on to something else and torture you that way.\n\nAlong with OCD, I also had severe depression. I found behavioral activation helpful. Behavioral activation is basically forcing yourself to do things. Depression will make you feel like all you want to do is sleep or sit in a dark room and not speak to anyone, eat anything, or enjoy anything you once did. I found behavioral activation, along with Lamotrigine very helpful. Again, success doesn't happen overnight.\n\nWhen my depression got really severe, I found electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) extremely helpful. ECT is a small brief seizure you experience while asleep which helps \"reboot\" the brain. Don't believe the scary nonsense online about ECT if you are considering it for severe depression. Thousands of people undergo ECT every year to successfully overcome their medication resistant depression. \n\nOCD is a bully. The only way to beat it is to knock the bully out.\n\ninfo@webeatocd.com - Want to ask me a question? Speak to me directly?

And none of them said that it is major depresion, very unlikely. Also, for about two weeks I was relatively fine, the thoughts were still there, but seemed less likely. Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?!

At this point in time, I was having regular weekly psychotherapy sessions with a very well-trained OCD Clinical psychologist and I was well into my 3rd month of SSRI treatment. Now, although I had and was continuing to make progress, I was not satisfied with how much progress I had made at this point. I also became quite concerned that I seemed to be making a great extent of progress and then in less than a week I began to fall back and my OCD symptoms began increasing yet again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Ive stated, my therapy included a combination of both SSRI medication and psychotherapy. The psychotherapy was particularly centred around CBT based therapy whereby I was challenged to expose myself to thoughts and/ or compulsions that I was experiencing with OCD (commonly known as Exposure and Response Prevention ~ ERP). As difficult as this was to me, I seemed to make steady strides with this form of therapy. However, the same could not be said with how effective I believed the SSRI seemed to be. I was quite sceptical to begin with when being introduced to SSRI&amp;#39;s after i&amp;#39;d previously conducted research on the matter, but I was willing to give it a go as my psychiatrist insisted that this particular SSRI (sertraline) is considered to be quite effective in the treatment of OCD. Now, in saying this, strangely enough, within the first week or so, I began to notice an enhancement in my overall mood and I also started to not view my obsession so disturbingly. The thoughts were still present, but I seemed to be able to kind of put them aside in a sense. Unfortunately, this experience was very short lived-by and within a week later my OCD thoughts were back in full force. I wasn&amp;#39;t so worried though, as I was informed that I wouldn&amp;#39;t notice the full effects of the sertraline until around the 6-12 week mark. So I continued to up my dose as directed by my psychiatrist and to continue my psychotherapy sessions weekly. At around the 3 month mark I was still not noticing any changes specifically by the medication. I brought this up with my psychiatrist and he stated that we will just continue to up the dose until you notice you&amp;#39;re making some changes again. I was not satisfied with this response, but I continued to follow his directions and also start conducting my own fairly extensive research on medication and OCD. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is where the post ties in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However id like to just state a few things before you consider this treatment:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Although im fairly knowledgeable on the topic of medicine (it interests me).

As such, I began heavily researching two particular drugs being: \n- Psychedelic Mushrooms\n- Ketamine \nI was astounded to find that these drugs had extremely encouraging results from both clinical trials conducted by world-class Universities and personal testimonials. As such, I became incredibly fascinated by said drugs and spent hours upon hours of research learning more and more about them. Now I could go on forever talking about these drugs and how encouraging their outcomes have been!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Im going to add my personal experience im a few hours in a part 2, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi fellow OCD peeps!                                                      \nNot long (&lt; 2 weeks) ago I was at a fairly low point in my journey fighting OCD. At this point in time, I was having regular weekly psychotherapy sessions with a very well-trained OCD Clinical psychologist and I was well into my 3rd month of SSRI treatment. Now, although I had and was continuing to make progress, I was not satisfied with how much progress I had made at this point. I also became quite concerned that I seemed to be making a great extent of progress and then in less than a week I began to fall back and my OCD symptoms began increasing yet again. \n\nAs Ive stated, my therapy included a combination of both SSRI medication and psychotherapy. The psychotherapy was particularly centred around CBT based therapy whereby I was challenged to expose myself to thoughts and/ or compulsions that I was experiencing with OCD (commonly known as Exposure and Response Prevention ~ ERP). As difficult as this was to me, I seemed to make steady strides with this form of therapy. However, the same could not be said with how effective I believed the SSRI seemed to be. I was quite sceptical to begin with when being introduced to SSRI's after i'd previously conducted research on the matter, but I was willing to give it a go as my psychiatrist insisted that this particular SSRI (sertraline) is considered to be quite effective in the treatment of OCD. Now, in saying this, strangely enough, within the first week or so, I began to notice an enhancement in my overall mood and I also started to not view my obsession so disturbingly. The thoughts were still present, but I seemed to be able to kind of put them aside in a sense. Unfortunately, this experience was very short lived-by and within a week later my OCD thoughts were back in full force. I wasn't so worried though, as I was informed that I wouldn't notice the full effects of the sertraline until around the 6-12 week mark. So I continued to up my dose as directed by my psychiatrist and to continue my psychotherapy sessions weekly. At around the 3 month mark I was still not noticing any changes specifically by the medication. I brought this up with my psychiatrist and he stated that we will just continue to up the dose until you notice you're making some changes again. I was not satisfied with this response, but I continued to follow his directions and also start conducting my own fairly extensive research on medication and OCD. \n\n*This is where the post ties in*\n\nHowever id like to just state a few things before you consider this treatment:\n\n1) Although im fairly knowledgeable on the topic of medicine (it interests me). I am most definitely NOT a qualified professional. \n\n2) I do not recommend you self medicate yourself without a) conducting extensive research and b) seeking advice by a medical professional if you're already taking other forms of medication, as there can be serious \nconsequences if you interact the wrong drugs together.\n\n3) Although these drugs can be legally prescribed in some countries, in most countries they are illegal substances.\n\nSo, I personally had come the conclusion that I was not responding to SSRI'S and was in desperate need of an alternative that was both very effective and also could work fairly quickly.

I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s \u201cchecking\u201d me because he\u2019s into my dick, or if he\u2019s checking to make sure I\u2019m still smaller than him (I also think he is obsessed with his own size - not much bigger than me, but I think a lot of his confidence comes from this). It all sort of seems narcissistic, and feels a bit like sexual abuse. \n\nAny advice, or personal stories, would be appreciated. I need to know how to talk to him about this. Thank you. \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7h2cib", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Penis obsession and compulsive groping", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7h2cib", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7h2cib/penis_obsession_and_compulsive_groping/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512245936.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7h2cib/penis_obsession_and_compulsive_groping/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "gunnerchameleon", "created_utc": 1512217136.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ihavtheblues, if you&amp;#39;d like to message/talk to me again, then don&amp;#39;t be afraid to make another account :) \nAnd don&amp;#39;t feel discouraged: I enjoyed talking to you and it gave me something to look forward to every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Ihavtheblues, if you'd like to message/talk to me again, then don't be afraid to make another account :) \nAnd don't feel discouraged: I enjoyed talking to you and it gave me something to look forward to every day.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gwpfz", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "A friend I made on here deleted their account", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7gwpfz", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7gwpfz/a_friend_i_made_on_here_deleted_their_account/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512179646.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7gwpfz/a_friend_i_made_on_here_deleted_their_account/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "self_hating_prophecy", "created_utc": 1512150846.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 27}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have OCD, and one of my intrusive thoughts is that God can&amp;#39;t really hear thoughts and silent prayers.

It\u2019s not just a case of me being dramatic here - if I don\u2019t join them then someone inevitably comes to find me and will kinda force me into the garage to socialise. His family/friends don\u2019t get how this is an issue for me and it\u2019s so hard for me to explain. \n\nI\u2019m worried this is starting to affect my relationship with my boyfriend. When I know we have to visit his family I get really anxious and stressed out for about a week beforehand knowing that I\u2019m going to a place that I can\u2019t stand being in. I have no idea how to share these feelings with him without being rude or insulting to his family. \n\nAnyway my hope in sharing all of this is to get some tips on dealing with spending extended periods of time so far outside of my comfort zone and around so many triggers. How does everyone else deal with these kind of situations? \n\nTLDR: Have to spend Christmas with my bf\u2019s family whose house and ways of socialising hit basically every single one of my triggers.

Maybe some of you can relate to it and hopefully I can help some of you that are struggling with it. Also, I want people to know that you are not the only one out there so don\u2019t feel like you are alone in this. Sorry if this is long, but here we go\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I\u2019ve suffered from Anxiety for over 8 years now and it has made life hard for me. I had panic-attacks, I had trouble sleeping, and I rarely wanted to go out, a lot of things made me very anxious. Basically, I had General Anxiety symptoms. It also caused me to have bouts of depression where I didn\u2019t want to leave my bed some days. I went through the whole medication deal a few years ago and my doctor put me on all different anti-depressants and so on. I had terrible reactions/side effects from each medication and decided I wasn\u2019t going to take medication anymore. I know for some medication could be helpful, but it wasn\u2019t worth it for me. After some time I decided to do my own research and go the supplement route as well as learning relaxation and diversion techniques to help cope with my anxiety.  After about a year I finally felt a lot better. I felt stable and functional after what seemed like forever. Now I still did have random moments of anxiety, but it was a lot more controllable and didn\u2019t bother me so much. I finally felt good; I got a good job, was able to go out all the time, and just have fun. Things were looking up for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a little over a year ago, I developed really bad OCD, mainly the contamination kind. It probably started before that, but it didn\u2019t really get worse and worse until about a year ago. I couldn\u2019t touch anything with my hands; I was excessively washing my hands and washing for long periods of time. I have to wear gloves to touch certain things, and the list goes on. My life went a full 180 degrees. I lost my job and haven\u2019t worked in a year; it\u2019s difficult to do most things. Basic tasks are even a pain. Every day is a struggle for me. Everything feels like a chore and has to be planned and it just takes so much time out of a day and it\u2019s exhausting. It feels like being in limbo, like you\u2019re there, but not really there. At times I just feel lifeless, like even my personality is gone. It\u2019s just really frustrating and sometimes makes me angry or depressed. It\u2019s feels like you are trapped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recently though, I have done a lot of research on OCD and Anxiety and I have tried some different techniques on my own and it has helped, however I feel like I have hit a wall again.

However, you can choose what you do with the thoughts. Remember they are only thoughts, it does not mean that they will come true or that you have to act upon them. As hard as it may be the best thing to do is just ignore them, do nothing about them, just let them go and move on. It takes time and isn\u2019t easy, but if you make an effort, you will see progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have an intrusive thought or you feel the need to do a compulsion, stop and think would a person without OCD do this?

You just have to start with the things that don\u2019t bother you as much and work your way up to the more difficult ones. You can make a chart and try to rate the things that you fear or obsess over from 1\u2013 10, one being the least feared to ten which is the thing(s) that bother you the most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are some methods that I have found to be the most helpful with coping with my OCD and Anxiety. Every day is still a challenge for me, but you have to be positive and make an effort to make changes and really try to overcome these obsessions/compulsions. It\u2019s not easy, it takes courage, but it helps and gets easier over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember to never give up no matter how difficult things may get.

Maybe some of you can relate to it and hopefully I can help some of you that are struggling with it. Also, I want people to know that you are not the only one out there so don\u2019t feel like you are alone in this. Sorry if this is long, but here we go\u2026\n\nSo, I\u2019ve suffered from Anxiety for over 8 years now and it has made life hard for me. I had panic-attacks, I had trouble sleeping, and I rarely wanted to go out, a lot of things made me very anxious. Basically, I had General Anxiety symptoms. It also caused me to have bouts of depression where I didn\u2019t want to leave my bed some days. I went through the whole medication deal a few years ago and my doctor put me on all different anti-depressants and so on. I had terrible reactions/side effects from each medication and decided I wasn\u2019t going to take medication anymore. I know for some medication could be helpful, but it wasn\u2019t worth it for me. After some time I decided to do my own research and go the supplement route as well as learning relaxation and diversion techniques to help cope with my anxiety.  After about a year I finally felt a lot better. I felt stable and functional after what seemed like forever. Now I still did have random moments of anxiety, but it was a lot more controllable and didn\u2019t bother me so much.

Then all of a sudden after i read about a guy who was suicidal. The thoughts came back and feel realer than the real. The scary thing is that there are feelings, not only thoughts. For example: Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have 100% desire to die. Then I got hit by (anxiety) not sure and the thoughts seemed even more real, like i really had a desire. It lasted about an hour then I calmed and the thoughts felt less real. Today the same thing happened. Today I also had pulsating neck pain on the right side.(Maybe it is sign of anixety?!?!

I&amp;#39;ve been NEET, living with my mom for 4 years. I feel stuck. So much has happened to me over this period. I&amp;#39;ve had run-ins with the police. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for a stretch of time. My ex-girlfriend almost strangled me to death. I burned all my bridges. And now, I&amp;#39;m dealing with this fucking disease. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been fighting this madness inside my head since March 2016. I call it the &amp;quot;alignment problem&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve had signs of it all my life, but March 2016 was a particularly stressful time for me, and that&amp;#39;s when it spiraled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For context, I&amp;#39;ve always felt that I&amp;#39;m not fully immersed in the present moment, like there&amp;#39;s something I need to finish before I can truly enjoy and experience &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;. Imagine you want to unwind, and relax, but you have to finish a work assignment, or a report, and so there&amp;#39;s a hanging presence of unfinished business constantly following you around until you finish. That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve felt like all my life, like I&amp;#39;m not truly relaxed, because I have something I need to &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This thing I need to &amp;quot;finish&amp;quot; has destroyed me. I describe it as an optimization process, or an alignment process. It feels like I have to straighten out my very core, and once I do, I&amp;#39;ll be at the forefront of reality, able to live freely and relax without feeling the presence of unfinished business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In March 2016, when I felt the urge to straighten myself out, I decided for the first time that I&amp;#39;d start work on this unfinished business and align myself as such. When I refer to &amp;quot;alignment&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m often using the term in a very literal sense. Picture a dark, cavernous space, with a bubble inside it, directly located in the center. That bubble was me. I felt the urge to be fully aligned and symmetrical, in a very literal, visual sense, and if I wasn&amp;#39;t, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to move forward with my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d often lay down in bed and visualize myself in this dark, cavernous space for hours. I needed to remember it at all times. I needed to be centered at all times. These initial visualizations led to a more &amp;quot;intellectualized&amp;quot; approach, where I would actually try to prove I was &amp;quot;in the center&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it started like this...&amp;quot;in the center&amp;quot;... what does that mean, exactly, and how can I make it true? Eventually, I came to the word &amp;quot;important&amp;quot;. If I want to be truly &amp;quot;centered&amp;quot;, I have to become the most important person in the Universe. Not for any egotistical reason. Purely for the sake of alignment and symmetry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I came up with a list of arbitrary facts about myself and the world, and tried to maneuver them into some &amp;quot;grand truth&amp;quot; about the Universe, so that I could prove my significance and finally become centered. Every part of me knew it was untrue and knew I wasn&amp;#39;t universally significant, but I needed it to be true, and I practically FORCED it to be true. For days and days and weeks and months I forced myself to remember every significant fact about myself to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; that I was worthy of alignment and symmetry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about 3 months of this, my consciousness was fucking rattled, almost to the extent of numerous psychedelic trips. I felt like I was off the planet. Three straight months of forcing untrue drivel into reality by repeating it incessantly to myself. Three straight months of looping thoughts, desperately trying to find my center. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I developed derealization. My moods became incredibly erratic. Paranoia set in. I was no longer on planet Earth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this period, I realized I would not be able to align myself this way, by forcing absurd truths into existence. I figured, hey, if I want to center myself, I have to center myself using facts. And so I did. I spent another four months trying to unravel the true nature of reality. I thought if I could understand the world around me, as well as morality, I&amp;#39;d finally be aligned and have strong justification for my actions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four months went by. Another long stretch of time, trying to accomplish the impossible. Trying to answer every question known to man so that I have symmetry in my life. After this, I no longer had anything to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot;. I was just lost. The alignment problem began to seep into every facet of my life, whether it be fitness, speaking with family and friends, organizing my home, literally everything became an issue of symmetry and balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything needed to be &amp;quot;just right&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was only in the summer of this year that I started to realize... Maybe there&amp;#39;s no solution here. Maybe I&amp;#39;m too far gone. At this point, I&amp;#39;d developed severe delusions, probably stemming from all the months of obsessive thoughts and ruminations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I finally saw a psychiatrist, about a month ago. I&amp;#39;m apparently schizophrenic, which makes sense, but I think there&amp;#39;s more to it than that. She prescribed me Risperdal, which I haven&amp;#39;t really taken. I&amp;#39;m in a state of chaos right now. It&amp;#39;s been nearly two years of repeating thoughts. Fucking &amp;quot;alignment&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me thinks I shouldn&amp;#39;t take medication, because if I force myself not to, my mind might accelerate into &amp;quot;overdrive&amp;quot; mode and automatically revert back to normal. I&amp;#39;m desperately hoping for this. I just want to go back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I wrote this post, frankly, but I&amp;#39;m now thinking of killing my ex-girlfriend. I&amp;#39;ve had thoughts like this before but this time it&amp;#39;s real. I want to kill her, film it, and became famous for it. And then maybe I&amp;#39;ll kill myself. I can&amp;#39;t take these repeating thoughts anymore. I can&amp;#39;t do it anymore. Just can&amp;#39;t do it. I want it to end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT SAID... I think this would all go away if I could just solve this fucking alignment problem. Maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t have to end like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess what I want to ask is... does this sound like OCD to you? Would antipsychotics even help my situation? Am I so far gone it&amp;#39;s not even worth it anymore? I&amp;#39;ve been awake nearly 36 hours and I&amp;#39;m struggling to see the point of living anymore. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

So much has happened to me over this period. I've had run-ins with the police. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for a stretch of time. My ex-girlfriend almost strangled me to death. I burned all my bridges. And now, I'm dealing with this fucking disease. \n\nI've been fighting this madness inside my head since March 2016. I call it the \"alignment problem\". I've had signs of it all my life, but March 2016 was a particularly stressful time for me, and that's when it spiraled out of control.\n\nFor context, I've always felt that I'm not fully immersed in the present moment, like there's something I need to finish before I can truly enjoy and experience \"now\". Imagine you want to unwind, and relax, but you have to finish a work assignment, or a report, and so there's a hanging presence of unfinished business constantly following you around until you finish. That's what I've felt like all my life, like I'm not truly relaxed, because I have something I need to \"finish\" first.\n\nThis thing I need to \"finish\" has destroyed me. I describe it as an optimization process, or an alignment process. It feels like I have to straighten out my very core, and once I do, I'll be at the forefront of reality, able to live freely and relax without feeling the presence of unfinished business.\n\nIn March 2016, when I felt the urge to straighten myself out, I decided for the first time that I'd start work on this unfinished business and align myself as such. When I refer to \"alignment\", I'm often using the term in a very literal sense. Picture a dark, cavernous space, with a bubble inside it, directly located in the center. That bubble was me. I felt the urge to be fully aligned and symmetrical, in a very literal, visual sense, and if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to move forward with my life. \n\nI'd often lay down in bed and visualize myself in this dark, cavernous space for hours. I needed to remember it at all times. I needed to be centered at all times. These initial visualizations led to a more \"intellectualized\" approach, where I would actually try to prove I was \"in the center\".\n\nSo it started like this...\"in the center\"... what does that mean, exactly, and how can I make it true? Eventually, I came to the word \"important\". If I want to be truly \"centered\", I have to become the most important person in the Universe. Not for any egotistical reason. Purely for the sake of alignment and symmetry. \n\nSo I came up with a list of arbitrary facts about myself and the world, and tried to maneuver them into some \"grand truth\" about the Universe, so that I could prove my significance and finally become centered. Every part of me knew it was untrue and knew I wasn't universally significant, but I needed it to be true, and I practically FORCED it to be true. For days and days and weeks and months I forced myself to remember every significant fact about myself to \"prove\" that I was worthy of alignment and symmetry. \n\nAfter about 3 months of this, my consciousness was fucking rattled, almost to the extent of numerous psychedelic trips. I felt like I was off the planet. Three straight months of forcing untrue drivel into reality by repeating it incessantly to myself. Three straight months of looping thoughts, desperately trying to find my center. \n\nI developed derealization. My moods became incredibly erratic. Paranoia set in. I was no longer on planet Earth. \n\nAfter this period, I realized I would not be able to align myself this way, by forcing absurd truths into existence. I figured, hey, if I want to center myself, I have to center myself using facts. And so I did. I spent another four months trying to unravel the true nature of reality. I thought if I could understand the world around me, as well as morality, I'd finally be aligned and have strong justification for my actions moving forward.\n\nFour months went by. Another long stretch of time, trying to accomplish the impossible. Trying to answer every question known to man so that I have symmetry in my life. After this, I no longer had anything to \"prove\". I was just lost. The alignment problem began to seep into every facet of my life, whether it be fitness, speaking with family and friends, organizing my home, literally everything became an issue of symmetry and balance.\n\nEverything needed to be \"just right\". \n\nIt was only in the summer of this year that I started to realize... Maybe there's no solution here. Maybe I'm too far gone. At this point, I'd developed severe delusions, probably stemming from all the months of obsessive thoughts and ruminations. \n\nAnd so I finally saw a psychiatrist, about a month ago. I'm apparently schizophrenic, which makes sense, but I think there's more to it than that. She prescribed me Risperdal, which I haven't really taken. I'm in a state of chaos right now. It's been nearly two years of repeating thoughts. Fucking \"alignment\". I can't take it anymore. \n\nPart of me thinks I shouldn't take medication, because if I force myself not to, my mind might accelerate into \"overdrive\" mode and automatically revert back to normal. I'm desperately hoping for this. I just want to go back to normal. \n\nI don't know why I wrote this post, frankly, but I'm now thinking of killing my ex-girlfriend. I've had thoughts like this before but this time it's real. I want to kill her, film it, and became famous for it. And then maybe I'll kill myself. I can't take these repeating thoughts anymore. I can't do it anymore. Just can't do it. I want it to end.\n\nTHAT SAID... I think this would all go away if I could just solve this fucking alignment problem. Maybe it doesn't have to end like this.\n\nI guess what I want to ask is... does this sound like OCD to you? Would antipsychotics even help my situation? Am I so far gone it's not even worth it anymore? I've been awake nearly 36 hours and I'm struggling to see the point of living anymore. I don't know what to do. Please just help me, tell me something that will help me. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7fwhnh", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Please help me (very long post)", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7fwhnh", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7fwhnh/please_help_me_very_long_post/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511830183.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7fwhnh/please_help_me_very_long_post/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "nubt29104", "created_utc": 1511801383.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t think anything negative or like criticize a person/think something bad  about anyone because if I do something bad will happen to them (death, accident, etc) so as a result, I knock my feet together tap my knees then tap my face in order to clear myself of the thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I can\u2019t think anything negative or like criticize a person/think something bad  about anyone because if I do something bad will happen to them (death, accident, etc) so as a result, I knock my feet together tap my knees then tap my face in order to clear myself of the thought.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7fv56t", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Anybody else experience this?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7fv56t", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7fv56t/anybody_else_experience_this/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511817990.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7fv56t/anybody_else_experience_this/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "thatgirltag", "created_utc": 1511789190.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know what I&amp;#39;m feeling.

There&amp;#39;s some truth to this, probably: I&amp;#39;m sure you all know that it&amp;#39;s hard to concentrate on things when you&amp;#39;re trying to ignore the urge to give into a compulsion, and obviously I want to be able to give my full attention to the piece I&amp;#39;m writing so that it turns out well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might argue that me trying to write &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; articles is an obsession in and of itself, but in this case it&amp;#39;s not about that: it&amp;#39;s just about writing good articles that will get high ratings and not be rejected. So, for the past few days, I have been going back and forth about whether to try and do some French in the next month, or to wait to do any kind of exposures until I&amp;#39;m in therapy.

It started out with incest thoughts towards my sister. Then in may I started getting thoughts not about myself being incest but if incest is morally ok and I had a lot of anxiety around that thought, until I finally admitted to myself that there is nothing wrong with incest about 2 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in summer vacation I got thoughts that didn&amp;#39;t stop me about thinking if beastiality and necrophilia are okay. I basically don&amp;#39;t have an opinion on these things and my therapist also told me that I don&amp;#39;t need an opinion on things like these.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about 6 weeks ago I started getting thoughts like &amp;quot;Would I leave my wife that I&amp;#39;m together with for 40 years that sexual contact with a dog about 45 years ago&amp;quot; and a lot of questions like this. I just couldn&amp;#39;t stop tinking and getting these questions into my mind. Basically my opinion on most of these questions is that I wouldn&amp;#39;t do it (I forgot a lot of these questions but this is the one that I remember). My therapist told me I don&amp;#39;t need to think of these questions, but wouldn&amp;#39;t a normal human being have a stance on these things(I try to have on most of them)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 4 weeks ago I started thinking about the morality of eating animals and I really can&amp;#39;t justify eating meat. But I also read something about plants that feel pain and now I think what can I even eat without doing harm to a living creature or thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also about 4 weeks ago I got a thought that basically looked at everything realistically animals is murder, then I got thoughts like well then I need to have sex with my sister and I don&amp;#39;t know why I got these thoughts, but they just seemed so true and I basically believed them but was really unhappy and tried to disprove the idea or the thought and I basically came to the conclusion, just because we eat animals doesn&amp;#39;t mean we should have sex with our relatives there is basically no logical connection to all of that and we don&amp;#39;t need to harm ourselves just for because we as humankind harm other species when we basically can&amp;#39;t just stop doing that from one day to another and that it basically only makes us unhappy and we should just try to live life with animals without kiling (I know it won&amp;#39;t happen today or tomorrow but maybe some day).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then also about 3 weeks ago I got the idea that maybe you get numb to sex with something you think is disgusting after a while so: &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t humans go over their disgust to sex with animals and have sex with them so they always have a partner&amp;quot;(disregarding) and I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;ve gotten the thought but I really struggled to find any answer to this question. What answer I have is: Humans don&amp;#39;t have sex with animals because it&amp;#39;s probably natural instinct to not have sex with animals, humans don&amp;#39;t see animals as a sex partner and we&amp;#39;ve not been raised that it&amp;#39;s good and honestly I really don&amp;#39;t want to go against that as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the next idea that I had also about 3 weeks ago is that since we kill animals we need to let them have sex with us (for example let a dog hump our leg to finish) and this view also really made me uncomofortable because I didn&amp;#39;t see anything speaking against it. So basically I thought we would deprive them of sex. Now my answer to that question is this: Dogs and other animals dont feel bad if you reject them if they hump you that is uniquely to humans and if humans dont want to have sex with animals there is really nothing wrong with it. The thing why do I need to tell myself this a few weeks ago i was arguing with myself with beastiality should even be legal and now I get thoughts that why are we not doing this? I obviously felt really uncomfortable and it took me about 3 4 days to find the answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now yesterday evening I got the same thoughts again but didn&amp;#39;t believe my answer that if humans don&amp;#39;t want it it&amp;#39;s not wrong to not have sex with them because basically animals won&amp;#39;t have a fulfilled life. It took me about 4 hours to get to this answer. Every dog in the world can probably live without humping their owner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday when I came home from school the thought came into my mind &amp;quot;If you look at someone else and imagine to be your sibling and get aroused that wouldn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re attracted to your sister&amp;quot; and I said that it means that but the thought just didn&amp;#39;t leave it was like I actually believed it, I had another one &amp;quot;If my sister calls me daddy that wouldn&amp;#39;t be implying a sexual relationship and incest&amp;quot; but basically there is no way you call your brother like this. It was just like I said it isn&amp;#39;t like this but I didn&amp;#39;t believe myself I don&amp;#39;t know what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday evening I got a lot of anxiety because of the guilt I have or I feel like I don&amp;#39;t have because of these and then for about 30 minutes I watched a video and got hope again and then got the thought: Maybe OCD is caused by my grandmothers death two years ago and I need to masturbate to her as kind of a ritual and my sister one time so the thoughts will stop. The same situation again I felt like it would actually work but I was really anxious and also felt like I was going insane. I didn&amp;#39;t do it but I still feel guilty and don&amp;#39;t know what to do I really don&amp;#39;t feel normal anymore, I feel guilt but that it&amp;#39;s not as bad as the guilt I had 8 months ago when I masturbated and an intrusive thought came while masturbating. Back then I wanted to kill myself and I had this physical guilt and really didn&amp;#39;t feel like doing anything anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently my guilt maybe feels a bit physical but not that much and mentally I still think I can get out of this. But to me what happened jsut doesn&amp;#39;t seem like OCD to my anymore. Usually OCD thoughts are things that you don&amp;#39;t want and now these &amp;quot;questions&amp;quot; that I had regarding the human sexuality and animal sexuality and the why don&amp;#39;t I have sex with my sister when I&amp;#39;m eating meat or why we don&amp;#39;t have sex with animals, and that yesterday I thought maybe the thioughts would go away if i masturbated to my dead grandmother and my sister they are jsut too much I am seriously going insane. It seems like questions I actually believed and I ran around up to a week with these questions not finding an answer I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do and since the guilt doesn&amp;#39;t feel that bad I mean I feel guilt but it just doesn&amp;#39;t feel enough for what is actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just strave for this feeling I used to have last year, everything felt like a miracle, I remember last winter I was at a friends house and just started shaking and crying because of how much I enjoyed my life and how glad I am to be alive. even though sometimes in the last months it wasn&amp;#39;t that I could never let myself go it was never the feeling I used to have I always have this feeling that something is off that I can&amp;#39;t be in the moment and now I&amp;#39;m just going insane. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how and why but I hope there is an explanation for all this even though I kind of lost hope and maybe it&amp;#39;s just better to not go on with my life since who wants to be with some one that had these ideas anyways? I wouldn&amp;#39;t, I would be way too uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I wanted is to have a girlfriend and chill with my friends but now I realized I&amp;#39;m killing animals and vegetables just to eat and have all these really disgusting thoughts to that I didn&amp;#39;t find an answer over longer periods of time. What if I would&amp;#39;ve masturbated to my dead grandmother yesterday, it felt like I would&amp;#39;ve actually done it. I just feel like it&amp;#39;s too late for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Maybe this is too fucked for some people to read but please, over the last few months I lost any joy in life and really don't know what to do anymore, I just feel like I'm getting crazier and crazier everyday.

I didn't do it but I still feel guilty and don't know what to do I really don't feel normal anymore, I feel guilt but that it's not as bad as the guilt I had 8 months ago when I masturbated and an intrusive thought came while masturbating. Back then I wanted to kill myself and I had this physical guilt and really didn't feel like doing anything anymore. \n\nCurrently my guilt maybe feels a bit physical but not that much and mentally I still think I can get out of this. But to me what happened jsut doesn't seem like OCD to my anymore. Usually OCD thoughts are things that you don't want and now these \"questions\" that I had regarding the human sexuality and animal sexuality and the why don't I have sex with my sister when I'm eating meat or why we don't have sex with animals, and that yesterday I thought maybe the thioughts would go away if i masturbated to my dead grandmother and my sister they are jsut too much I am seriously going insane. It seems like questions I actually believed and I ran around up to a week with these questions not finding an answer I really don't know what to do and since the guilt doesn't feel that bad I mean I feel guilt but it just doesn't feel enough for what is actually going on.\n\nI just strave for this feeling I used to have last year, everything felt like a miracle, I remember last winter I was at a friends house and just started shaking and crying because of how much I enjoyed my life and how glad I am to be alive. even though sometimes in the last months it wasn't that I could never let myself go it was never the feeling I used to have I always have this feeling that something is off that I can't be in the moment and now I'm just going insane. \n\nI don't know how and why but I hope there is an explanation for all this even though I kind of lost hope and maybe it's just better to not go on with my life since who wants to be with some one that had these ideas anyways? I wouldn't, I would be way too uncomfortable.\n\nAll I wanted is to have a girlfriend and chill with my friends but now I realized I'm killing animals and vegetables just to eat and have all these really disgusting thoughts to that I didn't find an answer over longer periods of time. What if I would've masturbated to my dead grandmother yesterday, it felt like I would've actually done it. I just feel like it's too late for me.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7f8ibo", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I've hit rock bottom of my life and feel like I'm actually going insane I don't know what to do and how to look back on all this", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7f8ibo", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7f8ibo/ive_hit_rock_bottom_of_my_life_and_feel_like_im/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511569684.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7f8ibo/ive_hit_rock_bottom_of_my_life_and_feel_like_im/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "nitsyy", "created_utc": 1511540884.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so confused.

Oh right, because some germs can make you sick. But how do you know if you have the good germs or bad germs on your hands? What? There\u2019s no way to know either way? But if I don\u2019t constantly wash my hands until they\u2019re raw and bleeding, what if by some stroke of bad luck I contract e. Coli and end up dying? Well, I guess I won\u2019t stop washing my hands then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you see, uncertainty gives me great anxiety.

By this time, my blood was rushing, heart was pounding very deep and I began to break into a sweat. \nI tried to fight it to no avail. I kept on trying to convince myself that this will go away but it didn\u2019t because I just had to find out what song with part came from. I tried to remember one song and looked it up but it wasn\u2019t it so now I was trembling in panic, already contemplating suicide. Then out of the blue, I remembered listening to the song Feel It Still by Portugal the Man and by the time the part of this song which was stuck in my head came around, I felt some relief. \nStill, this panic attack left me in a sort of PTSD state since I could not sleep well after it. The next morning, I still felt shaky but got up, only to remember a familiar sound out of nowhere again. I used to listen to three radio stations and in between the songs, there would be sound effects and this sound I remembered was just that. \nI tried to remember from which radio station this sound effect came from but I could not so panic and anxiety once again set in. I needed to know from which radio station this sound effect came from and the only way to find out was by listening to the radio but I did not want to do it since that would make my anxiety and panic even worse. I knew that by listening to the radio, I would go down a slippery slope and just make my issue worse since there would be other sounds which would trigger me. Plus, I did not know if this sound effect was being played on the radio anymore but what if it was? \nThen I began thinking about how my time was limited to find this sound effect because they might change it eventually like they did in the past and eventually FM radio will shut off because now everyone is streaming music and using XM radio since that is what is going to be more popular so my change of ever finding that sound will go down to zero since FM radio will go extinct. \nThis happed on Monday 11/20/2017. It is now Wednesday 11/22/2017, by 21st birthday and while some people celebrate their birthdays, I am still in a state of panic, anxiety, shock, fear, nervousness and depression. I really want to kill myself because I see no escape from this situation. I am scared right now and hope there will be someone I can talk and help me find out what is wrong with me. \nI used to have similar episodes but they all seemed to have an end but this one just feels like it will never go away. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "It happened on Sunday 11/19/2017 at around 9:00pm.

A year later, he told me that he couldn&amp;#39;t ask his girls (his new family) to do that. I was heart broken. And felt so abandoned. That&amp;#39;s the first time fear entered my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years later my mother picked up a chronic auto-immune disease, left undiagnosed for about 10 years. It was brutal watching her slowly die, an organ failing every year for 3 years before she started to get weekly infusions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point after that, my father molested my sister in a movie theatre, while I just sat there. I felt so helpless, so betrayed, and like I should have done something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My whole life, I never felt like I was good enough. I was always trying to be better, do better, be a better person... And it was exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Addiction runs in the family, and it&amp;#39;s a bit of a tradition to go to rehab when you&amp;#39;re 21. I made it 4 days after my 21st birthday. I had been an addict for years. My first tattoo at 18 was &amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t stop if I could&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, my OCD started slowly over a month or two after a bad trip. I took a bunch of 2c-e, and did a bunch of nitrous and hallucinated my friends giving me an intervention saying I was bi-polar and &amp;quot;had a problem&amp;quot;. Then I watched myself die. I woke up out of that zoned-ou-hal-conscious nitrous state, and ran outside. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, I had been an addict for a long time, stealing thousands of dollars, stealing monthly supplies of my mom&amp;#39;s pain pills at a time, unable to stop, and unwilling... But I wasn&amp;#39;t suffering enough yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That all changed when, after this bad trip, I read something about the McKinsey scale and how &amp;quot;everyone is a little bit bisexual&amp;quot;. I was determined to know if that was true, and started checking myself constantly. Probably 600 times a day. It was exhausting... and started to really hurt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was also a very active member of the communist party (think super hippies, not Russia, although we did get a few bad eggs from time to time)... But I wasn&amp;#39;t seeming to make as big of a difference as I wanted, so one day, after taking a bunch of xanax and trying to make myself gay, I got a boner for the first time (after about 5 months of checking a minimum of 100 times / day... rofl) and thought &amp;quot;Okay sweet. I now know there&amp;#39;s a little part of me that&amp;#39;s gay, time to move on.&amp;quot; So I wondered how to best get into politics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing that most politicians are narcissists, I decided I would make myself a narcissist. Who needs to have a soul if I can make the world a better place for others? I&amp;#39;m happy to sell away my own happiness and sense of goodness if it makes things better for the billions of people without food or clean water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well. That&amp;#39;s when I picked up the OCD of being a narcissist. Within 3 days, I was broken. I no longer knew what I believed about anything, and the drugs all stopped working. I started doubting everything I knew about myself and avoided thinking I was right about everything... For future reference, the assumption &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m always wrong about everything&amp;quot; is not a very good assumption... It&amp;#39;s a bit way too extreme.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called my mom, and signed myself up for rehab. If the drugs don&amp;#39;t work, why keep going? Looking back, this was the first real attack of OCD I had... Checking stuff a hundred times a day was normal, but never stopping the train of thought for days on end? That was new to me. Nothing could distract me or change my focus from the fact that I no longer knew who I was or what I believed in. If fentanyl won&amp;#39;t work, nothing will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flash forward a month. I&amp;#39;m coming down after years of opiate addiction, and my sister asks how I feel. I respond &amp;quot;If nothing changes in the next year, I&amp;#39;m going to kill myself&amp;quot;. It was just a fact. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9 months later, and nothing has changed, so I decide to start using drugs again. The OCD is as bad as ever, my brain won&amp;#39;t never stop running around in circles, repeating the same loops over and over, and I can never stop checking myself for whatever happens to be the OCD of the day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out drinking wasn&amp;#39;t enough fun, I was too scared to use hallucinogens, so I tried opiates again. I quickly realized that no human is ever supposed to like something that much, and I&amp;#39;ve never done them since. Not even when I broke my ankle. So I smoked weed all the time instead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next almost year, I smoked weed and let my OCD run wild. I would start getting deep into that hole on a weekly basis, freaking out about my heart rate increasing, simple things like a hypnogogic hallucinations at the end of a long day (where you see things with your eyes closed), etc... I was utterly convinced at all times that if I didn&amp;#39;t keep constant tabs on myself and my thoughts, I would go crazy and schizophrenic... So i became hyper-vigilent in checking every thought I had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent about a year obsessing and checking constantly whether or not &amp;quot;any of this shit is even real man&amp;quot;. How do I know I&amp;#39;m in reality and what&amp;#39;s happening is really happening? Let&amp;#39;s check. Constantly. Always. Check. Check. Check. Check. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was miserable. I would cry every day that I made it past noon without smoking weed. Simply because stopping the drugs was the only thing I wanted in the world. They were tears of joy. I blamed them for the anxiety and OCD, but they were also my only solution &lt;em&gt;to the OCD&lt;/em&gt;. Talk about a negative feedback loop... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, about a year after my relapse, I sat down in meditation one day, after a particularly rough OCD day (I happened to watch a movie about schizophrenia and was freaking the f*** out), I saw my drug use so clearly... I knew how it all worked. I saw the cycle! It all made sense! I could finally stop... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt so liberated, so free, that I sat up, went to the living room, and smoked a bowl without thinking. My first thought was &amp;quot;Oh well. Gigs up&amp;quot;... So I started going back to 12 step meetings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The OCD flared up like crazy for the first month, because I had nothing to numb it, but slowly died down. It took another 2 years to get a formal diagnosis, and the money to see a shrink. Yup. Just as I suspected. It was OCD all along. Some people call it Pure-O. I call it OCD. It&amp;#39;s not purely obsessional for me, because I always have to check myself, and check my surroundings. Those are compulsions. Check. Check. Check. Check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a long bout of ERP (the only thing that has ever worked), my symptoms are finally fully manageable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During an average week, I&amp;#39;ll spend about 30 minutes obsessing and checking. Not so bad, eh? Not so bad at all! At least, I&amp;#39;m damn proud of it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 2 or 3 times a year, I stop practicing shit, find a new obsessional fear and something new to check, and start going down the rabbit hole again. But you know what? Every time they get shorter. It doesn&amp;#39;t take me a year to break out of that hole anymore. I&amp;#39;ve done it so many times now, that I can go from paralyzed laying on my bed checking myself and obsessing for 18 hours a day to up and about, returning to my normal life in 4 days flat. That&amp;#39;s some damn good progress folks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I hopped down that rabbit hole, but I climbed out in only 3 hours! It&amp;#39;s a record. I went from unable to stop obsessing, unable to stop checking, to smiling with a clear head, able to think about the topic without obsessing in 3 mother f***&amp;#39;ing hours. It&amp;#39;ll still be here for the next week, but it&amp;#39;ll die back down and I&amp;#39;ll go a few months of having a totally normal, fulfilling life. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent years of my life not knowing how to do this stuff. The fact that I can do it in 3 hours, 4 days, 1 week? That&amp;#39;s amazing. I probably lose a total of 4 weeks each year to this disease these days... Before, I lost 3 years straight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a generally happy person. I see my shrink, I&amp;#39;m grateful, and I have some of the best friends anyone could ever ask for. My best friend, whom I met in pre-school, is still my best friend today, decades later. I started an english 12-step meeting in my town, and am a contributing member of the addiction outreach community. I&amp;#39;m now also living in another country, speaking another language, and getting my PhD in quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no longer paralyzed by fear most of the time. No longer running from my problems with drugs or using other avoidance strategies. I&amp;#39;m no longer trapped by years of obsessions which I only knew how to escape with opiates and weed. I&amp;#39;m no longer afraid every second of my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is light at the end of this tunnel. For so long, it was so far away that I couldn&amp;#39;t see it... but I see it now, and sometimes, I&amp;#39;m bathed in it. And god damn is it a nice, warm light after a cold dark life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, I still check my ego or penis or whatever all the time about whether I&amp;#39;m a narcissist, or gay, or a pedophile, or a murderer, or whatever absurd non-sense it is that week. Sure I still sometimes ask myself if this is real, and have to touch my leg to know that I even exist... but you know what? It&amp;#39;s about 1000x better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not an exaggeration. My quality of life is 1000x better. I just finished building a spectroscope that is currently the best of its kind in the entire world. I am a contributing part of the scientific and volunteer community, I have had deep and fulfilling relationships with friends, family, and lovers, and, you know what? For the most part, &lt;strong&gt;I am okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever be cured, but you know what? That&amp;#39;s okay too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love you guys, and see how much some of you suffer, the desperation in your posts and your sense of being lost, because I too was there. For years I was there... And I want to share some of my hope. There is another way to live. There is another side. You don&amp;#39;t have to suffer like you do. You just don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did I do it? ERP mostly. But I also learned and practiced every tool I could find. See, my obsessions, rumination, and checking were all just bad coping strategies for fear and intrusive thoughts. They work some of the time, they really do, but not often. Rumination and checking are even useful, if not necessary, for certain parts of life... They just don&amp;#39;t fix anything when it comes to fear or insecurities or intrusive thoughts. When I learn other coping skills, and practice them a lot, I have such a wide variety of tools, that if one doesn&amp;#39;t work, I just go to the next one. Every problem in life needs a particular solution, so I carry around a tool belt of coping skills with me today, instead of just one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Acceptance, ERP, meditation, deep breathing, more acceptance, more ERP, sometimes gritting my teeth or squeezing my fist into a ball, chewing gum, going for a walk, regular exercise, eating well, staying hydrated, being with friends instead of isolating, more acceptance and ERP, doing things for others just to get out of my own head, etc... etc... I have sooo many coping strategies now, that one of them almost always works. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll find them too. Help is out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My dad left down when I was 4 and promised to come back in a year.

I would cry every day that I made it past noon without smoking weed. Simply because stopping the drugs was the only thing I wanted in the world. They were tears of joy. I blamed them for the anxiety and OCD, but they were also my only solution *to the OCD*. Talk about a negative feedback loop... \n\nEventually, about a year after my relapse, I sat down in meditation one day, after a particularly rough OCD day (I happened to watch a movie about schizophrenia and was freaking the f*** out), I saw my drug use so clearly... I knew how it all worked. I saw the cycle! It all made sense! I could finally stop... \n\nI felt so liberated, so free, that I sat up, went to the living room, and smoked a bowl without thinking. My first thought was \"Oh well. Gigs up\"... So I started going back to 12 step meetings. \n\nThe OCD flared up like crazy for the first month, because I had nothing to numb it, but slowly died down. It took another 2 years to get a formal diagnosis, and the money to see a shrink. Yup. Just as I suspected. It was OCD all along. Some people call it Pure-O. I call it OCD. It's not purely obsessional for me, because I always have to check myself, and check my surroundings. Those are compulsions. Check. Check. Check. Check.\n\nAfter a long bout of ERP (the only thing that has ever worked), my symptoms are finally fully manageable. \n\nDuring an average week, I'll spend about 30 minutes obsessing and checking. Not so bad, eh? Not so bad at all! At least, I'm damn proud of it!\n\nAbout 2 or 3 times a year, I stop practicing shit, find a new obsessional fear and something new to check, and start going down the rabbit hole again. But you know what? Every time they get shorter. It doesn't take me a year to break out of that hole anymore. I've done it so many times now, that I can go from paralyzed laying on my bed checking myself and obsessing for 18 hours a day to up and about, returning to my normal life in 4 days flat. That's some damn good progress folks.  \n\nToday, I hopped down that rabbit hole, but I climbed out in only 3 hours! It's a record. I went from unable to stop obsessing, unable to stop checking, to smiling with a clear head, able to think about the topic without obsessing in 3 mother f***'ing hours. It'll still be here for the next week, but it'll die back down and I'll go a few months of having a totally normal, fulfilling life. :)\n\nI spent years of my life not knowing how to do this stuff. The fact that I can do it in 3 hours, 4 days, 1 week? That's amazing. I probably lose a total of 4 weeks each year to this disease these days... Before, I lost 3 years straight. \n\nI'm a generally happy person. I see my shrink, I'm grateful, and I have some of the best friends anyone could ever ask for. My best friend, whom I met in pre-school, is still my best friend today, decades later. I started an english 12-step meeting in my town, and am a contributing member of the addiction outreach community. I'm now also living in another country, speaking another language, and getting my PhD in quantum physics.\n\nI'm no longer paralyzed by fear most of the time. No longer running from my problems with drugs or using other avoidance strategies. I'm no longer trapped by years of obsessions which I only knew how to escape with opiates and weed. I'm no longer afraid every second of my life. \n\nThere is light at the end of this tunnel. For so long, it was so far away that I couldn't see it... but I see it now, and sometimes, I'm bathed in it. And god damn is it a nice, warm light after a cold dark life.\n\nSure, I still check my ego or penis or whatever all the time about whether I'm a narcissist, or gay, or a pedophile, or a murderer, or whatever absurd non-sense it is that week. Sure I still sometimes ask myself if this is real, and have to touch my leg to know that I even exist... but you know what? It's about 1000x better. \n\nThat's not an exaggeration. My quality of life is 1000x better. I just finished building a spectroscope that is currently the best of its kind in the entire world. I am a contributing part of the scientific and volunteer community, I have had deep and fulfilling relationships with friends, family, and lovers, and, you know what? For the most part, **I am okay.**\n\nI don't think I'll ever be cured, but you know what? That's okay too. \n\nI love you guys, and see how much some of you suffer, the desperation in your posts and your sense of being lost, because I too was there. For years I was there... And I want to share some of my hope. There is another way to live. There is another side. You don't have to suffer like you do. You just don't.\n\nHow did I do it? ERP mostly. But I also learned and practiced every tool I could find. See, my obsessions, rumination, and checking were all just bad coping strategies for fear and intrusive thoughts. They work some of the time, they really do, but not often. Rumination and checking are even useful, if not necessary, for certain parts of life... They just don't fix anything when it comes to fear or insecurities or intrusive thoughts. When I learn other coping skills, and practice them a lot, I have such a wide variety of tools, that if one doesn't work, I just go to the next one. Every problem in life needs a particular solution, so I carry around a tool belt of coping skills with me today, instead of just one. \n\nAcceptance, ERP, meditation, deep breathing, more acceptance, more ERP, sometimes gritting my teeth or squeezing my fist into a ball, chewing gum, going for a walk, regular exercise, eating well, staying hydrated, being with friends instead of isolating, more acceptance and ERP, doing things for others just to get out of my own head, etc... etc... I have sooo many coping strategies now, that one of them almost always works. \n\nAnd you'll find them too. Help is out there.\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ecibw", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I wanted to share a story of success, because sometimes this sub can be a bit of a downer (long).", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1511223270.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7ecibw", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7ecibw/i_wanted_to_share_a_story_of_success_because/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511243414.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7ecibw/i_wanted_to_share_a_story_of_success_because/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "sloth788", "created_utc": 1511214614.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had derealization 24/7 for the past 3-4 years, I&amp;#39;ve kinda learned to deal with it but I fear it may be caused by something else such as medication which I started before these symptoms started. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My medication has been working perfectly so far for my OCD, but I really do fear it is the root cause of these derealization symptoms I constantly deal with.

I want to rid the general population of the idea that OCD is something that is a joke - &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s so OCD!&amp;quot; but rather that OCD is something that can cause someone to &lt;em&gt;commit suicide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not asking for anything from you here apart from your advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think this is a good idea, or do you think this will harm us, as OCD sufferers?\nMy personal opinion is that the game will be a powerful message to people about what OCD really is.\nMy hope is not to make money from this game, but to raise awareness, for people to talk about OCD and what OCD really is. \nAs a programmer, and with my friend as an artist, this is how we feel we can help spread education about OCD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please answer, do you think this is a good idea - or do you think this will set us back?\nAlso, if you would like to be shown the script periodically, please comment below.

It means I'm further from being able to confide in anyone, because the perception of what OCD is further and further removed from what it actually is.\n\nIn this game, with the working title 'Life with OCD', we will explore a woman named Daniella (working name). She has OCD, particularly Harm OCD, and some of her obsessions involve intrusive thoughts regarding knives, driving, assaulting or murdering people. The obsession that affects her the most regards her profession - an elementary school teacher. You can probably guess what her obsession is here.\n\nThe game is going to depict her at her very worst, and will include very graphic images - such as her wrists covered in blood, and, if this particular ending is chosen, her dead body. The reason I want to depict such vivid and graphic images is because I don't want this game to detract from what someone with OCD is feeling, or what someone with OCD can do, and perhaps might do. I want to rid the general population of the idea that OCD is something that is a joke - \"That's so OCD!\" but rather that OCD is something that can cause someone to *commit suicide.*\n\nI'm not asking for anything from you here apart from your advice.\n\nDo you think this is a good idea, or do you think this will harm us, as OCD sufferers?\nMy personal opinion is that the game will be a powerful message to people about what OCD really is.\nMy hope is not to make money from this game, but to raise awareness, for people to talk about OCD and what OCD really is. \nAs a programmer, and with my friend as an artist, this is how we feel we can help spread education about OCD.\n\nSo please answer, do you think this is a good idea - or do you think this will set us back?\nAlso, if you would like to be shown the script periodically, please comment below. I would love that so I can get some feedback and not rely on my own OCD as a guide, but rather many peoples OCD as a guide so we can make this as realistic, and powerful, as possible.\n\nBest Regards.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ds5c8", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Making a Visual Novel game about OCD - Read inside before judging.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 13, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7ds5c8", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7ds5c8/making_a_visual_novel_game_about_ocd_read_inside/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511029666.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7ds5c8/making_a_visual_novel_game_about_ocd_read_inside/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "darthplagueis420", "created_utc": 1511000866.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sorry for the long post but people just can\u2019t fucking understand, please at least give me an opinion on this, please.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;people keep telling me \u201cjust don\u2019t think about that\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d, fuck off people, fuck. right. off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my older sister (23) was diagnosed with BPD and Depression by the beginning of this year and whenever she\u2019s feeling down i\u2019m &lt;strong&gt;100% always&lt;/strong&gt; there to listen to her and let her express her feelings, and I never &lt;strong&gt;EVER&lt;/strong&gt; mistreat or yell at her for saying things that aren\u2019t correct, such as having a family that constantly critiques her and thinks about her like she\u2019s a stupid person who\u2019ll never do anything and that we\u2019ll abandon her.

For almost half a year I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with hocd. This week it started when I was in gym class. We were playing broomball and my friend was on of the subs because we had more people then the other team he started cheering for me and for some reason I got the idea of &amp;quot;what if they think youre gay?&amp;quot; and it made me spike. This whole week ive been having trouble with hocd. It started with my friend Gabe and being afraid that he found me attractive or something and then the other incident was with my friend andrew. Back when i was fourteen I was going through my angsty teenage years. And one day he invited me over for a sleepover at his house for his birthday. Two nights before the sleepover i got this intrusive thought where i got this image in myu head that was like &amp;quot;what if my friend and I had sex&amp;quot; and because that was two years ago i don&amp;#39;t remember if it gave me anxiety or not but I do know that it was unwanted and not true so i forgot about it. However, now whenever I&amp;#39;m hanging out with him and my other friends I am always afraid of the thought: &amp;quot;What if you&amp;#39;re gay and you like him.&amp;quot; and its disgusting. I got one groinal response to this question and its been plauging me ever since. Look, im not gay, I know that, and I don&amp;#39;t agree with homosexuality. I don&amp;#39;t think its normal and I just don&amp;#39;t agree with it. I am a christian and I believe that homosexuality goes against God&amp;#39;s plans for humans and i know that homosexuality is sexually immoral. Now im not going to say &amp;quot;oh youre gay? Turn or burn?&amp;quot; because really you can&amp;#39;t convince someone who doesn&amp;#39;t want to be convinced. Anyway, I know that if I don&amp;#39;t agree with it and find it abnormal and disgusting (atleast to me) then why would I be it. This whole week i&amp;#39;ve been having these intrusive thougths and I would try to force myself to be attracted to women and I just wouldn&amp;#39;t feel it. I mean i know i like women but i was forcing myself to do it to keep my mind off hocd and it just made it worse. So this whole week i would be watching tv or something and i would think &amp;quot;wait, do i find that guy attractive?&amp;quot; (also i mean in a good looking way rather than a sexual way, you know? no homo) and then i would get anxiety and i would be like &amp;quot;uh uh think of girls!&amp;quot; and then i would force myself to think of girls. My attraction to girls will come back and i can feel it now a little, but it bothers me because it makes me feel like I am having the same feelins to both genders. And thats not what I&amp;#39;m saying! I know i am straight but hocd makes me question it because of all this anxiety and crap. Lastly i want to say, sometimes i get scared about whether this is hocd or denial and when I think about hocd and how ridicoulus it kinda sounds it makes me wonder: &amp;quot;Is hocd really a thing?&amp;quot; because i mean somepeople who say that hocd is a thing are the same people that say &amp;quot;there are 63 genders&amp;quot; you get what I mean? anyway, any helpful advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So let me start out by saying that I hate hocd and how it effects my brain.

What If i talk to a therapist and it turns out I really am a pervert- I'm so scared that it might be true, I'd rather just live like this than the potential of it ruining my life. I just I don't know. Please help.

My job involves working with elementary age kids after school, and sometimes I'll have a cute kid near me (usually a boy) and I'll think \"shit is me thinking he's cute sexual?\" and I'll get groinal responses if he tries to hold my hand or gives me a hug. It worries me so much, because now whenever I think of younger boys or something I'll get a groinal response. I don't want to be a pedophile. I just want to be normal and get married and have a normal life. \n\nI have trouble distinguishing just really liking a kid because he is cute and sweet or wondering if it's sexual. I would NEVER do anything sexual to a child. Ever. And honestly, I have zero desire to. That's just wrong and it is disgusting to me. \n\nI know this probably sounds like POCD, and it probably is. But I seriously cannot help wondering if I'm actually attracted to young boys sexually. \n\nI'll get the groinal responses when they touch me, but it doesn't FEEL sexual in nature. It's more like, \"aw this kid is cute I want to love and protect him.\" \n\nIDK. This is bothering the hell out of me especially because I absolutely adore kids and am studying to become a teacher. I have a passion for teaching and I just really enjoy helping kids with stuff. But just the fact that I *may* be a pedophile scares me so much and makes me worried that sometime in the future I might act on it or something. \n\nI just want some reassurance or something, from anyone else who's experienced this.

I&amp;#39;ve been cycling  through various real-event and intrusive-thought-based themes for over a month now, and as far as I can tell, it&amp;#39;s only getting worse. I really need to talk to someone about one that occurred to me today, and no one I know who might understand is awake/around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a freshman in high school (around 14/15), I had a pretty major crush on this guy--let&amp;#39;s call him &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;--who was sort of a part of my friend group. He was a senior (probably 18), and pretty obviously had a crush on my friend (&amp;quot;D,&amp;quot; also 14/15), which made me somewhat jealous. She overall found him creepy (understandably), but also seemed flattered in some ways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one day, while D was in line getting lunch, L said something to me like &amp;quot;do you dare me to smack/grab her ass when she gets back?&amp;quot; It made me uncomfortable, but not really knowing what to say and...ugh...wanting him to like me, I laughed along and said sure. So when she came back, he did it, and she understandably got really mad, and we (D, my other friends and I, minus L) went off to eat somewhere else. I never told her that I&amp;#39;d gone along with the idea, and acted as outraged as she was; by that point, I could see that it was bad for me to go along with it at all, and I felt bad. (I wouldn&amp;#39;t develop full-blown OCD for a few more years, though, so I didn&amp;#39;t feel BAD bad.) Anyway, the anger between them didn&amp;#39;t last, if I recall correctly, and L remained a vague satellite of our friend group for a few more years (yeah, he was...a super-super-super senior by the end of it? Long, sad story, fucked up family situation, etc. etc.). I was a weird, ugly kid, and...my crush on L continued for probably another year, approximately? Just sort of in the back of my mind; I had other crushes and stuff, but it was still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward...god...9 years? 10? I was 23, and L messaged me out of nowhere on facebook, and we talked a few times about nothing much. On some level, I guess having had a crush on him all those years before had left an impression, because I was...flattered. (I&amp;#39;d never fully internalized the idea that he was a bad guy, I guess, what with our peripheral friendship after the ass-grabbing incident.)

What the fuck is wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My OCD is worse than it's ever been. I've been cycling  through various real-event and intrusive-thought-based themes for over a month now, and as far as I can tell, it's only getting worse. I really need to talk to someone about one that occurred to me today, and no one I know who might understand is awake/around.\n\nWhen I was a freshman in high school (around 14/15), I had a pretty major crush on this guy--let's call him \"L\"--who was sort of a part of my friend group. He was a senior (probably 18), and pretty obviously had a crush on my friend (\"D,\" also 14/15), which made me somewhat jealous. She overall found him creepy (understandably), but also seemed flattered in some ways. \n\nAnyway, one day, while D was in line getting lunch, L said something to me like \"do you dare me to smack/grab her ass when she gets back?\" It made me uncomfortable, but not really knowing what to say and...ugh...wanting him to like me, I laughed along and said sure. So when she came back, he did it, and she understandably got really mad, and we (D, my other friends and I, minus L) went off to eat somewhere else. I never told her that I'd gone along with the idea, and acted as outraged as she was; by that point, I could see that it was bad for me to go along with it at all, and I felt bad. (I wouldn't develop full-blown OCD for a few more years, though, so I didn't feel BAD bad.) Anyway, the anger between them didn't last, if I recall correctly, and L remained a vague satellite of our friend group for a few more years (yeah, he was...a super-super-super senior by the end of it? Long, sad story, fucked up family situation, etc. etc.). I was a weird, ugly kid, and...my crush on L continued for probably another year, approximately? Just sort of in the back of my mind; I had other crushes and stuff, but it was still there.\n\nFast forward...god...9 years? 10? I was 23, and L messaged me out of nowhere on facebook, and we talked a few times about nothing much. On some level, I guess having had a crush on him all those years before had left an impression, because I was...flattered. (I'd never fully internalized the idea that he was a bad guy, I guess, what with our peripheral friendship after the ass-grabbing incident.) He was a terrible conversationalist, though so eventually I made it so he couldn't see that I was online. Problem solved.\n\nFast forward a few more months: I found him on Tinder. The curiosity overwhelmed me, so I swiped right. We matched, to my weird, sick, decade-old satisfaction. He messaged me, and we sent a few messages back and forth before it petered out. I don't *think* I'd have ever taken it any further than that, or met up with him, or anything, but...the satisfaction at the situation was there. I don't think I fully considered, in that moment, what had happened so long ago--if you'd asked me about it, I'd have remembered, but it wasn't on my mind.

My daughter HAS has some abnormal eye movements, but she's had two normal evaluations by a pediatric neurologist and a normal EEG. She is meeting milestones and appears to be very healthy. I should not be worried, but I am terrified. I'm currently taking Zoloft and though it has helped me a little, I still feel that my anxiety is interfering with my quality of life to a large extent. I've tried therapy several times before, but found it to be of little help; I need something more focused on practical strategies for living with anxiety than what I previously received.

I would imagine gay situations and also straight situations to see if I would get aroused and the gay situations never aroused me but the straight ones did. Somehow this wasn&amp;#39;t enough though and I still had the thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a few weeks ago, by some sort of magic it seems, I woke up and I no longer had the gay thoughts but they had switched to thoughts that I was a sociopath. I googled things like &amp;quot;how to tell if you are a sociopath&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;symptoms of sociopathy in childhood&amp;quot; but it tended to give me no relief. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then one night I was out with some friends and we are some marijuana edibles and then I went home. I felt fine when I got home but I ended up having what I thought was a panic attack and had racing thoughts and kept on hearing things even when I plugged my ears. The morning after and he following week I felt like I was out of my body or something and my vision was distorted kind of and had racing thoughts still. I googled this and cam across depersonalization which is what I thought it was until I found out that depersonalization was a symptom of schizophrenia. For about a week I had fears that I was becoming schizophrenic and that I would eventually not be able to control myself and end up harming someone close to me like my parents. I would check to see if the kings I was hearing were real like the furnace running in my basement. At the end of the week these feelings pretty much subsided but we&amp;#39;re exchanged with something different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This different thing was the fear that I am transgender and that I will eventually become a woman. I have nothing against transgender people, but these thoughts are giving me extreme anxiety and I am constantly googling how people know they are transgender and what not. I am wondering if I was actually transgender all along through my childhood and high school years and just was so oblivious to it that I did not know. I never felt different than my friends or anyone else and I always hung out with my friends and played sports and enjoyed them and all that but I feel like I&amp;#39;m staring to question whether that was real or not. I also analyze whether I like it whenever someone calls me my name because through googling I have figured out that transgender people do not like their given names. I have also thought that since I like girls and like to fantasize sexually about girls that I actually want to be them instead of have sex with them. I have never felt this way before and it&amp;#39;s giving me anxiety just talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I googled whether transgender people get erections, which I thought they didn&amp;#39;t before and that fav eke some relief, but through google I found out that they do sometimes. I also found out that transgender don&amp;#39;t get random erections and morning wood and recently I haven&amp;#39;t been getting morning wood because I thought I was depressed but now it is making me think that I am actually transgender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much for keeping this short but, I guess my question is can OCD be about anything or am I basically in denial about all of these thoughts that I am having? Hopefully someone here can provide me with some information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve had what it think were OCD thoughts before this like in high school I had thoughts about death and dying and heaven and hell and that and if there is life after death, and I also had this weird thing where I would have to consciously breathe in and out and I couldn&amp;#39;t focus on anything really except breathing when I wasn&amp;#39;t doing something that kept my mind off of it like reading.

Literally, within the course of a week, my life went from perfect to absolutely awful. I stopped going to school, I balled up in bed, and I questioned my sanity.

By the end of my sophomore year, I felt great and was nearly back to normal. Other than occasional anxiety and panic attacks, I managed to cope and live a completely normal life for the next three years. Now, my life is hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My depression first reappeared when I started college away from home and without friends. After only two days at college, I was unmotivated, felt sick, stopped eating and would cry each night. I wasn&amp;#39;t myself. I realized being in an unfamiliar city without people I knew wasn&amp;#39;t going to work so I decided to leave college, enroll in another university in my hometown where friends were currently attending. I decided a semester off would also be a good idea as it would allow me to travel and work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After leaving college, I felt immediate relief and was happy to be home. However, towards the end of September, I noticed that my anxiety had returned. I ended up checking myself into the ER one day before work as I thought I was having a heart attack. It turned out to be a panic attack. I restarted therapy immediately. Things began to turn around. However, after just two weeks, I began to experience my first symptoms of OCD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had always suffered from anxiety but the anxiety that I feel with OCD is unlike anything I&amp;#39;d ever felt. To be honest, much of my generalized anxiety did take the form of OCD thinking but I never realized it . I  just, one day, started thinking. All I could do was think about terrible and sickening things. I honestly thought I was going crazy. I thought it was only a matter of time before I was committed. I rolled up into a ball in the couch for two weeks. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I researched what I was experiencing that I realized that I wasn&amp;#39;t crazy but experiencing Pure-O OCD. I finally told my therapist about what I was thinking about and how I felt. I was admitted to an intensive patient program that I attend two hours a day five days a week. Additionally, my psychiatrist put me back on Zoloft. Soon, things got somewhat better. I started eating again and returned to work. However, I&amp;#39;d still describe my life as a living hell. I&amp;#39;m certainly not my normal happy self. I&amp;#39;m still in constant fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately, my OCD has completely enveloped my life. Though I&amp;#39;ve only been doing CBT/Exposure therapy for two weeks, I feel as if I should be getting better, not worse. My new fear is that I&amp;#39;m not actually OCD but schizophrenic. I feel like I could be a ticking time bomb and just one day wake up and be crazy. This has caused me to be extremely self-aware. All I can is notice stuff. I&amp;#39;m just waiting to notice something out of the ordinary that points towards me losing my mind. It&amp;#39;s caused me to return to having panic attacks and feeling depersonalized, something I felt back when I first experienced anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other Pure-O OCD obsessions include going crazy and harming others that I love, becoming homeless or a low-paid worker, dying, becoming a pedophile, not ever finding a companion to love me, and not ever feeling happy or fulfilled in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally every day for the last two months has been hell for me.

I\u2019m aware enough to realize that I deal with POCD today. I have intrusive thoughts about sexually abusing children, yes, but I realize they\u2019re just thoughts. They\u2019re just my piece-of-shit brain acting like an asshole. I find those thoughts horrifying and I don\u2019t actually want to act them out. Yes, it causes me distress, but I realize that, because they\u2019re ego-dystonic, they are, by definition, not who I am. I\u2019ve been through this whole charade before with HOCD, so I know what I\u2019m dealing with. In reality, I\u2019m kind of\u2026indifferent about kids/babies. Sure, they can be lovable, but they can also be a pain in the ass (as my experience at IKEA today showed me). And I\u2019m confident enough in myself as a person today to know that I\u2019m definitely not attracted to anyone underage, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; not to little kids. I\u2019m attracted to women my age (give or take about 3-5 years). There are times I worry that I\u2019m secretly, deep-down actually attracted to kids, but\u2026I know I\u2019m not.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was going through puberty, I didn\u2019t really have the type of access to porn back then that we all do today. I think I had dial-up (but I could be wrong about that), I didn\u2019t have a computer in my own room (but I could be wrong about that, as well), and I didn\u2019t have, well\u2026the balls to actually visit real porn sites. Even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t have known how to find them, and they weren\u2019t as easily accessible as they are today.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is going to sound weird, but I got turned on by looking in encyclopedias at articles about sex, genitals, etc. I remember I got this children\u2019s encyclopedia when I was in, like, second grade, and there was a page in it on human reproduction. It had drawings of a naked man and woman, descriptions and diagrams of their reproductive systems and sexual intercourse. I remember reading articles about female genitalia and the human sexual response cycle (arousal, foreplay, plateau, orgasm, etc.) in my Encarta Encyclopedia CD and getting turned on by them. That was \u201cporn\u201d for me.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is what\u2019s freaking me out. It happened when I was about 13-ish, right around the time I was using encyclopedias as porn. There was this one time when my parents and I went to visit a cousin of mine for dinner. I believe he and his wife were expecting a baby. My parents, cousin, etc. were all sitting in the living room and talking. I was bored, so I was walking around the house. I went into their bedroom and found a book about what to expect when you\u2019re pregnant. It was just basic stuff about what will happen to your body, what\u2019s expected, what\u2019s expected for your baby, what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s not normal, etc. The kind of book you\u2019d expect a pregnant woman to have. And here\u2019s where I, welll\u2026start freaking out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked that book up and started flipping through it because I thought that it might have some of those encyclopedic descriptions of female genitalia. Sure enough, it did - it had descriptions of what you should expect your baby\u2019s genitals to look like. And I got turned on by those descriptions. Now, in my head, the fact that it was describing a baby\u2019s genitals was irrelevant. In fact, if I remember correctly, I felt gross reading it at the time, but I was also turned on, which made me feel even more gross. In fact, there was a part of that book that said something like \u201cif you suspect your doctor has inappropriately touched your baby\u2019s genitals, report it to the police\u201d and my reactions were \u201cwell, duh\u201d and &amp;quot;holy shit, are there actually people depraved enough to do that?&amp;quot;. It wasn\u2019t specifically the description of a baby\u2019s genitals that turned me on. I just wanted to see those encyclopedia-style descriptions of female genitalia. If there had been a book describing or depicting, say, adult female genitalia, I would have looked at that instead. For example, I remember visiting some relatives in August 2001, seeing \u201cThe Joy of Sex\u201d in one of their bookshelves, and occasionally sneaking into that room and flipping through it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that episode has really been freaking me out and filling me with shame and guilt. Of course, I\u2019ve never touched a child inappropriately and have never wanted to. I hear stories of people sexually abusing babies and they horrify me. And of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I am not sexually drawn to children or babies or anything like that. And of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; I wasn\u2019t sexually drawn to children or babies back then. I never have been. And I know that the reason I picked up that book and started reading it was because I just wanted to read an encyclopedia-style description of female genitals. But now I\u2019ve been wondering if maybe I picked it up because, deep down, I really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; sexually drawn to children or babies. I\u2019ve never changed a baby\u2019s diaper, but I\u2019ve been wondering if, back then, if I had to\u2026would or could I have sexually abused the baby?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno, this whole thing has me quite freaked out, and I don\u2019t know what to do. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did anyone else do anything like what I did when they were that age? I\u2019ve really been feeling terrible. I\u2019ve been in a funk about this for a few days now and I don\u2019t know what to do. Life has kind of\u2026come to a standstill. Does this sound like POCD?

(It happens randomly.)\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0This is about babies. Somewhere I have read \"I don't want kids on this terrible world.\" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.\n\nweird feeling:\u00a0Everything seems darker.\n\n*AND THE MOST IMPORTANT* :**WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......**\n\nAnd many intrusive suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.\n\nI visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,\u00a0no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.\n\nAny suggestions what it might be? Do I sound suicidal?\n\nThanks in advance,\u00a0have a good night.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7cb81k", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "***TRIGGER WARNING*** Is this Suicide OCD or I am suicidal?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 9, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7cb81k", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7cb81k/trigger_warning_is_this_suicide_ocd_or_i_am/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1510465378.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7cb81k/trigger_warning_is_this_suicide_ocd_or_i_am/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "lostminddd", "created_utc": 1510436578.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Christianity and it destroyed my teenage years because of my obsessive thoughts concerning Hell and judgment.

I&amp;#39;ve never raped or molested anyone, but I was into some taboo fantasies when it comes to masturbation fantasies or watching things on the internet. I&amp;#39;ve never downloaded or found anything illegal, but that doesn&amp;#39;t stop my immoral behavior or pictures I&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;fapped&amp;quot; to or the different subjects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped the really &amp;quot;abhorrent&amp;quot; fantasies years ago but I never stopped masturbating. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I got older that I realized what a piece of shit I&amp;#39;ve been in my life and that I didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be alive. I met an amazing woman who is the only person I&amp;#39;ve ever truly wanted to be with, but I&amp;#39;ve slowly realized she was put in my life to make me realize what an awful human being I&amp;#39;ve been and to punish me for it by the fact that I can never be with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a binge eater as well and I eat food like a drug addict would take drugs. It numbs me and when I start dieting and doing well the guilt overwhelms and empowers me. I&amp;#39;ve even done NoFap and done pretty good on some long streaks but it never eases the guilt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But recently when I look things up on the internet to &amp;quot;fap&amp;quot; to I feel nothing but guilt and I bring it on myself. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have these problems if I would just &amp;quot;fap&amp;quot; to my fantasies instead of searching for stuff. When I look for things I usually go to safe sites. I actually prefer the more non-gratuitous stuff like you would find in movies. Today I was &amp;quot;fapping&amp;quot; and on a safe movie website  where they add movie scenes and you can scroll through their recent additions. Well I was scrolling through it and I saw someone on there who looked relatively young, clicked away and found other porn to look at and finished. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it started to bother me and of course I searched the movie and the person was 16 years old when they filmed it. I&amp;#39;ve been going to this website for years and have never had to worry about this and now I&amp;#39;m feeling awful about it, like I&amp;#39;m a straight up sick human being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that I am, but I don&amp;#39;t want to be a bad man but when these things happen I feel like my world is closing in around me. I feel like I start doing better but then it gets worse because I can&amp;#39;t quit searching for things to &amp;quot;fap&amp;quot; to on the internet. Then when I&amp;#39;m scrolling through things I&amp;#39;ll see something on there and start obsessing about the age of the person. I know that I&amp;#39;m not actively searching for it,  but when things like today happen it brings me back to my guilt. I actually prefer women who are older than myself and I always have but that doesn&amp;#39;t stop me from feeling guilt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be a sick human being but I realize that I am and I know how incoherent my post is. I know that I&amp;#39;m probably going to offend people and I&amp;#39;m sorry, especially to every woman in the world I&amp;#39;ve ever been disrespectful to. I know that porn isn&amp;#39;t healthy and it&amp;#39;s not a solution. I just want to stop feeling guilt and I understand that I bring it on myself. Things like today and seeing these things accidentally make me realize that I have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for offending anyone, but I needed to post this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm going to apologize ahead of time because my post is going to be all over the place, but I'm just having to get this out there because it's eating me alive.\n\nSo to start off I want to say that I've never officially been diagnosed with OCD/Anxiety but I'm almost 95% sure I have it because I do nothing but live with guilt/fear about every bad thing I've done, especially when it comes to Sexual Things.\n\nI'm terrified to even type this out because What if someone comes and arrest me and everyone finds out what a sick freak I am, but I can't hold it in any longer.

Well I was scrolling through it and I saw someone on there who looked relatively young, clicked away and found other porn to look at and finished. \n\nThen it started to bother me and of course I searched the movie and the person was 16 years old when they filmed it. I've been going to this website for years and have never had to worry about this and now I'm feeling awful about it, like I'm a straight up sick human being.\n\nI know that I am, but I don't want to be a bad man but when these things happen I feel like my world is closing in around me. I feel like I start doing better but then it gets worse because I can't quit searching for things to \"fap\" to on the internet. Then when I'm scrolling through things I'll see something on there and start obsessing about the age of the person. I know that I'm not actively searching for it,  but when things like today happen it brings me back to my guilt. I actually prefer women who are older than myself and I always have but that doesn't stop me from feeling guilt.\n\nI don't want to be a sick human being but I realize that I am and I know how incoherent my post is. I know that I'm probably going to offend people and I'm sorry, especially to every woman in the world I've ever been disrespectful to. I know that porn isn't healthy and it's not a solution. I just want to stop feeling guilt and I understand that I bring it on myself. Things like today and seeing these things accidentally make me realize that I have a problem.\n\nI'm sorry for offending anyone, but I needed to post this.

And everybody I tell seems to have some explanation.

But I just want to understand people the feelings that are going on. Probably they&amp;#39;re not even real. Freaking hell. But I just idk. Nobody fucking believes me.

It started typically handwashing and stuff, I thought I would get AIDS from stupid shit that doesn't make sense at all scientifically or practically AT ALL, but I felt it was real, I had to lie to people in public that I was cold when they asked about my red bloody hands, because, \"what's wrong with your hands?\" I walked on paper towels and stuff when I got home, I had a \"safe space\" which was built around my video games. I showered until I felt I could go play. That's the only thing I could do safely. No one fucking noticed or cared at home which is freaking bizarre apparently? Dad said \"Get over it.\" and Mom said \"Why didn't your dad notice?\" And it was like FUCK. WTF. As long as I'm not bothering you I'm not bothering you I guess. And I had no idea what was going on 'til I saw \"The Aviator\" which I obsessively research what, how, and why most movies I watch. Because I need to know why. Which I think from my experience most people just wonder \"why do you do that?\" and I can only wonder \"why do you not do that?\". \"Just because.\" I kept dealing with it for 14 years, and it turned into being irrationally pregnant (it's not possible scientifically), which I never was, being harmed physically, which never happened despite giving into \"if it happens it happens\", and then now it turned into an obsession with selling my soul for whatever reason that pops, but I can't play games anymore (what would you do to achive this?), I can't do anything anymore (if I succeed, what if?), especially objects contact etc. \"if this happens, perhaps I _____________\" my soul and I've said that out loud I told people because I'm afraid my soul will be gone. And everybody I tell seems to have some explanation. Like, \"Yeah, I'm like that too\" or \"Yeah, but you just gotta think about something else\" or \"Yeah, okay, just smoke weed.\" \"You need a to get laid.\" And I tell people, no I can't do that shit.

Reeeeeeally good.  I&amp;#39;d kinda like to share it with the community if that&amp;#39;s alright, it might help some.  Honestly, I came to a conclusion today given my pure- OOCD thoughts and well, thinking in general.  It comes from a previous line of thought that I&amp;#39;d never really explored before but actually helped me a lot.  I&amp;#39;m not gonna encourage anybody to go down it, but just say it&amp;#39;s an option that helped me out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The line of thinking started with a question: &amp;quot;What is a thought?&amp;quot;  Following that I wondered: &amp;quot;Where do thoughts come from?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Where do conscious thoughts come from?&amp;quot;  What followed was a freakout about who I am and what the &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; is.  It really isn&amp;#39;t important and I don&amp;#39;t particularly wanna discuss the unfortunate anxiety that the whole thing caused.  I will say I came to a conclusion and I haven&amp;#39;t felt this good in a long time.  My OCD (harm ocd that focuses on suicidal thoughts) hasn&amp;#39;t evinced any anxiety in me since.  When you think about it, OCD (at least pure-o) is just us living in a constant dialogue in our head that&amp;#39;s steadily getting louder as we try to scream the thoughts down.  But when you just stop listening it gets so much better.  I mean, they&amp;#39;re there, but they&amp;#39;re muted.  We can&amp;#39;t control our thoughts.  Nobody really can.  You can pick one out to analyze and change, but you can&amp;#39;t choose what to think.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts come from the subconscious mind; they come from information we already know and have experienced.  You and I, we aren&amp;#39;t defective for having OCD; we merely have louder thoughts that are a pain in the ass and that draw us in with their screaming.

I'd kinda like to share it with the community if that's alright, it might help some.  Honestly, I came to a conclusion today given my pure- OOCD thoughts and well, thinking in general.  It comes from a previous line of thought that I'd never really explored before but actually helped me a lot.  I'm not gonna encourage anybody to go down it, but just say it's an option that helped me out.  \n\nThe line of thinking started with a question: \"What is a thought?\"  Following that I wondered: \"Where do thoughts come from?\"  \"Where do conscious thoughts come from?\"  What followed was a freakout about who I am and what the \"self\" is.  It really isn't important and I don't particularly wanna discuss the unfortunate anxiety that the whole thing caused.  I will say I came to a conclusion and I haven't felt this good in a long time.  My OCD (harm ocd that focuses on suicidal thoughts) hasn't evinced any anxiety in me since.  When you think about it, OCD (at least pure-o) is just us living in a constant dialogue in our head that's steadily getting louder as we try to scream the thoughts down.  But when you just stop listening it gets so much better.  I mean, they're there, but they're muted.  We can't control our thoughts.  Nobody really can.  You can pick one out to analyze and change, but you can't choose what to think.  \n\nThoughts come from the subconscious mind; they come from information we already know and have experienced.  You and I, we aren't defective for having OCD; we merely have louder thoughts that are a pain in the ass and that draw us in with their screaming.  When you don't worry about it anymore, go with the flow, accept a neutral state (that's how it feels right now), you get a perceived silence.  Damned if it doesn't feel good right now.  I've tried controlling my thoughts for so long...when I didn't need to...at all.  Thoughts happen whether we want them to or not.  We don't have to act on them.  We most likely won't act on them.

I&amp;#39;m stressed, anxious and simply trying to speed through this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m 16 years old and I have always been attracted to girls mainly my age and above, well since puberty. I have had massive crushes that have lasted months, I&amp;#39;ve gotten nervous when around girls I liked. Heck, I was pretty crushed when I once found out that a girl I really liked got a boyfriend, I had mixed emotions for like a week after that though it soon dissipated (this stuff happened earlier this year). To add onto that, a lot of my celebrity crushes are at least in their early thirties and since discovering porn in my earlier years, all the material I have watched and gotten addicted to numerous times have only involved adults. With all this happening in my life, I&amp;#39;ve never even thought of watching CP or having sexual desires for kids, in fact I have always found kids to be annoying, immature and whiny. A year ago a friend of my parent&amp;#39;s brought her young daughters to a dinner and my sister and I were forced to look after them. That whole time I could&amp;#39;ve been more annoyed and frustrated at children.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So looking at all this, you might think well it&amp;#39;s obvious I&amp;#39;m not a pedophile. Yeah I thought the same too until 4-5 months ago while binging on the show Black Mirror, I came across the episode involving a young guy (around 18-19) who is caught masturbating to CP (this isn&amp;#39;t really revealed until the end of the episode). My first thought was &amp;quot;Wow, that&amp;#39;s a pretty young age to be a pedophile,&amp;quot; since I have always been accustomed to the usual &amp;quot;Old, creepy uncle who likes to diddle kids,&amp;quot; movie trope my whole entire life. Then I thought &amp;quot;What if I&amp;#39;m a pedophile? If a young teenager can still possess pedophilic tendencies, then it&amp;#39;s possible I could be one too, right?&amp;quot; This is when it suddenly spiraled out of control. I began digging over my past memories to see if I had done anything merely pedophilic.. and to my dismay, I did find a few odd episodes, nothing too big but it still dwells on me a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 12-13 I came across a few nudist websites (simply out of curiosity) and quickly became aroused (this is really fucking difficult to type) at some of the girls who were like 12. I do realise that it&amp;#39;s only just a one year gap between me and them but the thought of it still messes me up today. What if those girls were possibly 10 or 11, that would be really troubling. At 15 I came across the same website, scrolled through the images and felt pretty neutral about everything I saw, wasn&amp;#39;t disgusted nor aroused. I only found the older female teenagers to be quite arousing (around 15-17). There were a few other oddballs that are quite traumatizing and shameful such as when I searched up pictures of young teenagers on google images (in hopes to find people around my age) when I was 14 or 15 which I deeply fucking regret when looking at it now. A few times some of the porn I was watching involved adults acting as young teenagers, which I will admit I did find it pretty arousing back then. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a whole entire week after watching that Black Mirror episode it felt like I had reached lowest point of my life. I felt fear, sadness, anger, shame and most of all, worthless. I didn&amp;#39;t see a way out, I was slowly coming to the conclusion that I could be a pedophile. That maybe a normal life wasn&amp;#39;t possible for me. That all my future career aspirations and dreams would mean nothing. That I would never be able to fall madly in love with someone, never be able to pursue a career in music or graphic design, never be able to fulfil my dream of moving out of the country, never to be able to grow old alongside someone and die happy with them by my side... simply because of this stain on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have now found ways to manage these terrible thoughts but only to an extent. There will still always be those odd occurrences where that one small perverted thought would bring me down and make me feel like utter shit for the rest of the day. Like now for example, first it started with me fearing &amp;quot;What if when I&amp;#39;m 50 and I stop finding women my age attractive since you know everyone is ageing and I start targeting teenagers?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What if I turn into Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey?&amp;quot; Then further along in the day, while thinking about a pornstar I recently watched, weird thoughts started appearing in my head of how this woman looked a bit like that girl who plays Eleven from Stranger Things. A moment later, I reconciled my thoughts and again felt the same feelings of disgust and shame. And now these off-putting images won&amp;#39;t stop popping up in my head and so now I&amp;#39;m back in that same low point I was in before. Help&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Firstly, sorry if this all sounds very long and incoherent.

There were a few other oddballs that are quite traumatizing and shameful such as when I searched up pictures of young teenagers on google images (in hopes to find people around my age) when I was 14 or 15 which I deeply fucking regret when looking at it now. A few times some of the porn I was watching involved adults acting as young teenagers, which I will admit I did find it pretty arousing back then. \n\nFor a whole entire week after watching that Black Mirror episode it felt like I had reached lowest point of my life. I felt fear, sadness, anger, shame and most of all, worthless. I didn't see a way out, I was slowly coming to the conclusion that I could be a pedophile. That maybe a normal life wasn't possible for me. That all my future career aspirations and dreams would mean nothing. That I would never be able to fall madly in love with someone, never be able to pursue a career in music or graphic design, never be able to fulfil my dream of moving out of the country, never to be able to grow old alongside someone and die happy with them by my side... simply because of this stain on me. \n\nI have now found ways to manage these terrible thoughts but only to an extent. There will still always be those odd occurrences where that one small perverted thought would bring me down and make me feel like utter shit for the rest of the day. Like now for example, first it started with me fearing \"What if when I'm 50 and I stop finding women my age attractive since you know everyone is ageing and I start targeting teenagers?\" and \"What if I turn into Harvey Weinstein or Kevin Spacey?\" Then further along in the day, while thinking about a pornstar I recently watched, weird thoughts started appearing in my head of how this woman looked a bit like that girl who plays Eleven from Stranger Things. A moment later, I reconciled my thoughts and again felt the same feelings of disgust and shame. And now these off-putting images won't stop popping up in my head and so now I'm back in that same low point I was in before.

To the point where I have fucked up my relationships, and job opportunities. I have been scared to live my life. Every weekend I\u2019d sit in my closet crying, because I felt so unworthy of love and so disgusting. I never thought I was OCD, because I am not very neat and pretty scatter brained. It does run in my family though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother has Emetophobia (that means she\u2019s scared of throwing up) and she has been seeking help with it for years. I remember being a little kid and having her freak out about germs when we went to the mall or once when I got food poisoning she cried hysterically and had to go to a motel. In all other aspects of life my Mom has been an incredibly put-together, rational, selfless, high-functioning person. It wasn\u2019t like she was a crazy-nut job who would constantly go on tirades. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s part of what made her episodes so confusing for me. She said that throwing up was the ultimate loss of control and she was terrified of it constantly. It just seemed nonsensical and it was frustrating because she wasn\u2019t this way with anything else. \nNothing my Dad or anyone said could change her mind. I used to get mad at her sometimes because it seemed so stupid to me and I thought she was making it up for attention or something. I assume that that is how people feel when I talk about my body image issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 and I have trained myself to believe that I am not a real woman and that I will never be beautiful because my body is broken. For a long time I didn\u2019t seek help because I wasn\u2019t cutting, purging, restricting my eating, having crazy sex, doing drugs, shoplifting, or any of those things that people do when they are losing control. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would get naked on camera for men a lot. It became an addiction but because it didn\u2019t leak out into my everyday life and nobody knew about it I thought it was OK. I didn\u2019t date guys in real life cause it was too hard and painful. I felt as if by keeping my PCOS from them I was somehow lying to them and if they got close enough to find out they wouldn\u2019t want me. I would get so lonely and fill the void with men online. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would constantly google studies about a woman\u2019s perfect height/weight measurements.

I want out\u201d over and over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get these terrible intrusive thoughts that are completely perverse and morbid but I feel like they are true.

To the point where I have fucked up my relationships, and job opportunities. I have been scared to live my life. Every weekend I\u2019d sit in my closet crying, because I felt so unworthy of love and so disgusting. I never thought I was OCD, because I am not very neat and pretty scatter brained. It does run in my family though. \n\nMy mother has Emetophobia (that means she\u2019s scared of throwing up) and she has been seeking help with it for years. I remember being a little kid and having her freak out about germs when we went to the mall or once when I got food poisoning she cried hysterically and had to go to a motel. In all other aspects of life my Mom has been an incredibly put-together, rational, selfless, high-functioning person. It wasn\u2019t like she was a crazy-nut job who would constantly go on tirades. \n\nThat\u2019s part of what made her episodes so confusing for me. She said that throwing up was the ultimate loss of control and she was terrified of it constantly. It just seemed nonsensical and it was frustrating because she wasn\u2019t this way with anything else. \nNothing my Dad or anyone said could change her mind. I used to get mad at her sometimes because it seemed so stupid to me and I thought she was making it up for attention or something. I assume that that is how people feel when I talk about my body image issues. \n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS at 15 and I have trained myself to believe that I am not a real woman and that I will never be beautiful because my body is broken. For a long time I didn\u2019t seek help because I wasn\u2019t cutting, purging, restricting my eating, having crazy sex, doing drugs, shoplifting, or any of those things that people do when they are losing control. \n\nI would get naked on camera for men a lot. It became an addiction but because it didn\u2019t leak out into my everyday life and nobody knew about it I thought it was OK. I didn\u2019t date guys in real life cause it was too hard and painful. I felt as if by keeping my PCOS from them I was somehow lying to them and if they got close enough to find out they wouldn\u2019t want me. I would get so lonely and fill the void with men online. \n\nI would constantly google studies about a woman\u2019s perfect height/weight measurements. I would compulsively google the heights and weights of celebrities and compare myself to them. I thought I was depressed but functional.

I am a 30F with contamination OCD. Recent stressful situation and I need someone to vent to who will understand my nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 weeks ago my apartment flooded with about 2 cm of water in the bedrooms by the windows because the drainage outside was blocked due to landscaping. I discovered at 11pm on a Saturday and had to call emergency maintenance. They vaccuumed up the water as best possible then left a commercial dehumidifier and air mover. They wanted to me to run them until the carpet was dry with the heat up to like 80 so the moisture would evaporate into the air for the dehumidifier to catch.\n1 week passes and I&amp;#39;m sleeping on the couch. Disgusted by the giant cord and water tube coming through my hall into my bathroom (one for power, other to drain into tub). They came into my apartment to check every day for 5 days (with dirty workboots on). After a week, the carpet is dry so I unplug the stuff and clean. A week later, they come back to pick them up.

Recent stressful situation and I need someone to vent to who will understand my nightmare. \n\n2 weeks ago my apartment flooded with about 2 cm of water in the bedrooms by the windows because the drainage outside was blocked due to landscaping. I discovered at 11pm on a Saturday and had to call emergency maintenance. They vaccuumed up the water as best possible then left a commercial dehumidifier and air mover. They wanted to me to run them until the carpet was dry with the heat up to like 80 so the moisture would evaporate into the air for the dehumidifier to catch.\n1 week passes and I'm sleeping on the couch. Disgusted by the giant cord and water tube coming through my hall into my bathroom (one for power, other to drain into tub). They came into my apartment to check every day for 5 days (with dirty workboots on). After a week, the carpet is dry so I unplug the stuff and clean. A week later, they come back to pick them up. They HAVE to come in with their workboots on \"because it's illegal to take of my shoes\" and then tell me I have to keep running the machines since the drywall is still wet. And they will keep coming back with their shoes on to check daily. \n\nI was able to be okay with the situation and look at is as ERP for the past two weeks.

Tidiness, organization, and repetition are personality traits. They can even be predominant, overwhelming personality traits. And though they can be common symptoms of OCD, these traits aren\u2019t actually indicative of the disorder...depicting a portion this big (small) of a concept this big (huge). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what actually is OCD? for all its misrepresentation, it\u2019s actually pretty simple. OCD has two components: obsessions and compulsions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obsessions are unwanted and repeated thoughts and feelings. Imagine being stuck in a loop where unwanted imagery plays in your head over and over. An obsession can be a constant, overwhelming focus on something you don\u2019t want to focus on\u2014 or it can be an intrusive thought that pops into your head completely at random and ruins your mood. It\u2019s awful because all you want is for it to be gone. That\u2019s an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to get rid of an obsession, the person with OCD will engage in a compulsion. That\u2019s an action that lessens the impact or gets rid of of the obsession. A compulsion could be cleaning or organizing, or it could be counting, tapping or touching. But compulsions don\u2019t stop at these common tropes; some other examples are confessing negative thoughts, altering your walking patterns, avoiding the touch of certain materials, engaging in specific eating behaviors... and more. A compulsion is usually performed with the intention of trying to escape an obsession or reduce an anxiety, even if that relief is only temporary. Compulsions can be extremely time consuming, depending on the severity of the person\u2019s OCD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OCD spans from mild to severe, and this scale is measured in two parts: firstly, by the intensity of the obsessions and compulsions. In mild OCD, obsessions and compulsions can be dismissed; the person can recognize an obsession and choose not to perform a compulsion. In severe cases, this is not an option. A person with severe OCD will have no option but to perform a compulsion, even if they completely understand that there is no logical basis for doing so. A person with severe OCD is completely at the mercy of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second component of diagnosis is how much time every day is taken up by obsessions and compulsions. Someone with mild OCD may only spend an hour or two per day being plagued with symptoms\u2014 that\u2019s the minimum amount of time per day needed to receive a diagnosis\u2014 whereas someone with severe OCD may spend 15 hours a day performing complex compulsions, and suffering from debilitating obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JJ Keeler, author of I Hardly Ever Wash My Hands: The Other Side of OCD, writes: \u201cOCD is not a disease that bothers; it is a disease that tortures.\u201d So what do you do if you have OCD? There is no cure for the disorder, but there are many treatment methods, the most common being cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention, aka ERP) sometimes in conjunction with medication, usually a SRI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 3.3 million Americans have OCD. 70% of them will benefit from therapy and SRIs. \nBut what do you do if you\u2019re in that 30% who is treatment resistant?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For my capstone project I am creating a video defining OCD.

But this weekend it\u2019s like a switch has flipped, I\u2019m feeling energetic, not lethargic, I\u2019m ready to plot through this rubbish job until I get one in the industry I love, I feel so much more drive, I feel ready to go to the gym every morning and then do long shifts stood up all day after, but my mind is still racing quit fast.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just needed to vent somewhere.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7b1j3i", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "OCD &amp; more (sh trigger)", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7b1j3i", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7b1j3i/ocd_more_sh_trigger/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1509956608.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7b1j3i/ocd_more_sh_trigger/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "SourMangoes", "created_utc": 1509927808.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone relate with it ?

I warn this is a long post, but yeah, no one knows it, and I mean no one, but I have OCD, I never sought help until I was 26, but that help did not help, because I managed to trick myself that I was better. I manipulated the entire system, tricked myself and them, became my obsession to do so, and so in 2014, I thought I was better, in my mind I did not have OCD, never did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just this week I realise I&amp;#39;ve been lying to myself for the last three years, because I very much do and it is completely destroying my life. I am unable to do so many things, just so many things simply because I spend all my time trying to hide the fact I am OCD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear is the reason, fear of weakness, how the world will see me if I can be beaten into submission by anxiety. Though in fact, I don&amp;#39;t even know anymore, I feel like I&amp;#39;ve lost all sense of reason, I do things simply because they&amp;#39;re obsessions, no other reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And anxiety is my punishment if I don&amp;#39;t, all the things I am OCD about, if I don&amp;#39;t do I can&amp;#39;t even describe to you have it feels. I pace back and forth, in a full on panic, and that panic keeps rising and rising, it completely cripples me, sometimes makes me want to cry, but I can&amp;#39;t cry, because men don&amp;#39;t cry, and so anger fills me and the rage forces the tears back, and so on the anxiety rises, and it will not stop rising until I bow to it and do whatever it is my obsession commands me to do, I don&amp;#39;t even fight it anymore, I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it effects everything, every part of my life, the clothes I wear, the food I eat, the order I eat food in, what I drink. I am lactose intolerant, but am I really. I don&amp;#39;t even know anymore, my mind has simply decided I am, and so I am because if I even touch anything with milk in it, I fall into a full on panic attack that I&amp;#39;m going to break out in hives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is completely illogical, irrational, but I am helpless to it, because of this, I eat a restricted diet that involves so few foods I could list them here, I won&amp;#39;t list them, simply because I don&amp;#39;t want to bore you, but I will tell you all that I am able to drink, and that is water. That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t drink alcohol anymore, I tell people it was a life choice. That&amp;#39;s a lie, it was because I became obsessed with the idea it gave me bad skin, and I am OCD about my skin. A single spot can mentally cripple me. I can&amp;#39;t tell you why, it just doesn&amp;#39;t look clean and so if I get a spot I tear it apart, self mutilation, I literally sometimes rip the pore out, and feel relieved after, a giant bloody cut is clean, a spot is not. My minds logic, which no matter how hard I try, I can&amp;#39;t escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even a red dot on the TV screen effects me. On Sky Sports, the red dot for the interactive button, I have to get rid of that or I cannot watch the channel. Madness, but true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there is my career, or lack of it. I should be an investment manager, I&amp;#39;m not, I gave that career up, the true reason why is because I couldn&amp;#39;t bear the thought of doing a nine till five job, my mind simply couldn&amp;#39;t cope at the thought of my morning routine being messed with, I have things to do, and an order to do them in, a 9 till 5 job would mess with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never admitted to that until now. But it&amp;#39;s the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even now that morning routine is the same- no, in fact, it&amp;#39;s even more cumbersome, sometimes takes me four/five hours to complete. And every now and then with great mental effort I can break that routine and get up early, but it takes me a week, sometimes two weeks to mentally recover, sometimes a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve passed up on so many opportunities in my life over my inability to escape this routine, it is crazy. I always think, it&amp;#39;s fine, I&amp;#39;ll just fix myself, sort my head and be ready for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And fortunately for me, there is always a next one, I just never take them, always for the same reason, which infuriates me. I planned to do extra work on TV and film five years back, but it involved early morning starts, and I can do so few early mornings, it took me to this year to actually manage to be able to do extra work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even now, writing this, my morning routine has been messed up, and so I am actually writing this in an effort to distract my mind, because I am completely crippled by anxiety, and if I don&amp;#39;t do something my head will erupt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It couldn&amp;#39;t even if I wanted it to, an obsession of mine is not to give in. And so if I do bellow in anger, it is in silent anger, no sound, no reaction. You could see me sitting there, I would look in complete peace, calm as calm could be, yet inside, I&amp;#39;m on my knees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I gave up the career in finance, I tried to change careers, follow the dream job to become an author. I tell everyone I did this because I managed to earn enough money to allow a career change -- I turned \u00a37,000 into \u00a350,000 on the stock markets, mainly because it became an obsession to do so, and when something becomes an obsession, I will make it to the end, I can&amp;#39;t not. No matter what, I will finish. Simple as that. I said \u00a350,000, and so got to fifty, and have barely touched the stock markets since, I can&amp;#39;t. My mind won&amp;#39;t let me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the reality is, my mind said if I could do a freelance career, then I could keep my morning routine intact. So the reason I changed careers was to keep my morning routine exactly as it is, if you saw that routine, you likely wouldn&amp;#39;t see the order, but it&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Order is everywhere, and yet no one can see it but me. To other people, things can look in complete chaos, but to me, they are perfectly in order. Break that order, you break me, it&amp;#39;s that easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And OCD is not just obsession with order, that&amp;#39;s not the only thing destroying my hopes of succeeding as an author, perfectionism, that is another part of OCD. I create something, it gets praise, but perfectionism takes over and so it is never good enough, so I keep working on it, and working on it, and working on it, until my mind can&amp;#39;t take it anymore, can&amp;#39;t even bear the thought at working on it anymore, and yet, I keep working on it to the point I often destroy everything that was good about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to escape working on it, I start another project, a new obsession, but the same thing happens, as it stands I have five full length manuscripts written, none are ready, because I can&amp;#39;t bear the thought of going back to them. Even the thought mentally cripples me, so they sit there, and I begin something new, because it feels liberating to do something new, until it does not, and instead it gets added to the pile of obsessions that I am afraid to come back to, and yet every single moment of every day all I can think is, I need to go back to them, finish them, make them perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To try to escape this, I do something different, mediocrity, I focus on creating things that I&amp;#39;m not interested in, things that aren&amp;#39;t very good, never will be. I also try to do activities I am not very good it, even singing. I can&amp;#39;t be a good singer, so I try singing, because it can&amp;#39;t become an obsession. That liberates me. So I put rubbish out there, not for the world to see, but for me to see. It&amp;#39;s rubbish, but it&amp;#39;s okay, because I&amp;#39;m not obsessed by it, but then I become obsessed by the idea of mediocrity, and so creating mediocrity becomes my obsession, it&amp;#39;s like there is no escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with photography, I started it three years ago, but rather than doing it more, I am doing it less and less, and I can now barely take a picture out of the sheer fear that it takes me so long to edit. A picture that should take five minutes to edit, now takes me an hour, minimum; a picture that should take me an hour to edit, I wouldn&amp;#39;t even bear to think how long it would take. The level of editing I take it to, if you watched me doing it, you&amp;#39;d say what are you doing that for, it was fine as it was, I&amp;#39;d say I know, but I have to do this, I can&amp;#39;t not. You&amp;#39;d say, that&amp;#39;s madness, I&amp;#39;d say I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I simply don&amp;#39;t take pictures anymore, or take very few, and yet every moment of every day that passes all I can think is, I need to take pictures. And my only source of income comes from photography, and so I can&amp;#39;t make money, meaning the only reason I am not on the streets is because I live at home and have very supportive parents. I&amp;#39;ve never lived anywhere else, it&amp;#39;s impossible for me to, I have too many obsessions to be able to afford to move out, and I can&amp;#39;t get a proper job, because the anxiety of my morning routine being messed with is too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet I find it impossible to admit that, even writing this my mind searches for excuses, anything but the truth. This can&amp;#39;t be happening to me, not me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years I have been crippled by this and every day I become more crippled, fifteen years I have been running because it&amp;#39;s an obsession of mine to run from it, and my reward for doing all this has been to end up with so many obsessions all I can do is just sit there, doing nothing but fret about how I am going to do all these things I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the only thing that can give me a moments respite is to find a new obsession to overpower the old, this post is a new obsession, writing it. It gave me respite, not for long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally can&amp;#39;t do anything, I struggle to go to the gym, people think I spend my life in the gym, that&amp;#39;s a lie, two times a week if I&amp;#39;m lucky, I&amp;#39;m just genetically blessed, I would go more, I can&amp;#39;t. I struggle to read, struggle to watch films, TV shows, go places, do anything, it is literally an endless war. My mind is just so crippled with anxiety over how many obsessions I have, I literally struggle to do anything, I sometimes can&amp;#39;t even answer the most simple questions. Hell, I used to be a math whiz, now I struggle to do basic math, not because I can&amp;#39;t, but because I simply can&amp;#39;t concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same with English, all that time and effort studying the English language, and yet now I struggle to recall basic stuff, it&amp;#39;s not that I don&amp;#39;t know it, I just can&amp;#39;t focus well enough to recall the answer, and so I look in the mirror and I see a six foot two guy, blue eyes, ripped, someone with two degrees, and I just ask myself, how the hell can&amp;#39;t I beat this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I tell myself I can, and I pull myself together, and I put in an appearance with the outside world, and they see me, and I become David, and no one sees the reality, because David does not have OCD, he is invincible, drifts through life, everything a breeze. That&amp;#39;s the dream, not the reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is, I am broken, and all because I&amp;#39;m obsessed with the idea that I can fix myself alone, that I don&amp;#39;t need anyone. But I do, I can&amp;#39;t do it alone, I realised this the other day, and you&amp;#39;ve no idea how difficult is for me to accept it, how bitter a pill it is for me to swallow, and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what people say about whether it shouldn&amp;#39;t be or what not, the fact is, to me, it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, so I&amp;#39;ve reached out for help and I&amp;#39;m now getting it, or am going to be, I don&amp;#39;t know when it will begin, will just have to wait and see. But wish me luck in the hopes that I actually am able to finally beat this, because right now, for the first time in my life, I truly feel like I&amp;#39;ve been beaten. I won&amp;#39;t give up, because it&amp;#39;s an obsession of mine not to, but the fact is, that is the only reason I am not, and that scares even me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the downbeat post, but I&amp;#39;ve just realised that I&amp;#39;ve spent my entire adult life running from my issues, and my reward for doing this is simply to have created so many issues, that I can barely leave the house. Not that I have many places left to go, I&amp;#39;ve kicked so many people out of my life, it&amp;#39;s staggering, and all for one reason, they got too close to finding out the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s why I wanted to write this, and why I wanted to write this now, for the message. If you run from your issues, all you will do is compound them, so don&amp;#39;t make my mistake, if you&amp;#39;re facing mental health issues, don&amp;#39;t feel you need to face them alone, reach out for help, get help, get better, then get on with living your life. If you don&amp;#39;t, one day you&amp;#39;ll wake up like I did, look back at your life, and ask yourself, how the fuck did this happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience of OCD, and what trying to run from it did to me, in case it can help anyone else avoid making my mistake.  I warn this is a long post, but yeah, no one knows it, and I mean no one, but I have OCD, I never sought help until I was 26, but that help did not help, because I managed to trick myself that I was better. I manipulated the entire system, tricked myself and them, became my obsession to do so, and so in 2014, I thought I was better, in my mind I did not have OCD, never did.\n\nBut just this week I realise I've been lying to myself for the last three years, because I very much do and it is completely destroying my life. I am unable to do so many things, just so many things simply because I spend all my time trying to hide the fact I am OCD.\n\nFear is the reason, fear of weakness, how the world will see me if I can be beaten into submission by anxiety. Though in fact, I don't even know anymore, I feel like I've lost all sense of reason, I do things simply because they're obsessions, no other reason.\n\nAnd anxiety is my punishment if I don't, all the things I am OCD about, if I don't do I can't even describe to you have it feels. I pace back and forth, in a full on panic, and that panic keeps rising and rising, it completely cripples me, sometimes makes me want to cry, but I can't cry, because men don't cry, and so anger fills me and the rage forces the tears back, and so on the anxiety rises, and it will not stop rising until I bow to it and do whatever it is my obsession commands me to do, I don't even fight it anymore, I can't.\n\nAnd it effects everything, every part of my life, the clothes I wear, the food I eat, the order I eat food in, what I drink. I am lactose intolerant, but am I really. I don't even know anymore, my mind has simply decided I am, and so I am because if I even touch anything with milk in it, I fall into a full on panic attack that I'm going to break out in hives.\n\nIt is completely illogical, irrational, but I am helpless to it, because of this, I eat a restricted diet that involves so few foods I could list them here, I won't list them, simply because I don't want to bore you, but I will tell you all that I am able to drink, and that is water. That's it.\n\nI can't drink alcohol anymore, I tell people it was a life choice. That's a lie, it was because I became obsessed with the idea it gave me bad skin, and I am OCD about my skin. A single spot can mentally cripple me. I can't tell you why, it just doesn't look clean and so if I get a spot I tear it apart, self mutilation, I literally sometimes rip the pore out, and feel relieved after, a giant bloody cut is clean, a spot is not. My minds logic, which no matter how hard I try, I can't escape.\n\nEven a red dot on the TV screen effects me. On Sky Sports, the red dot for the interactive button, I have to get rid of that or I cannot watch the channel. Madness, but true.\n\nThen there is my career, or lack of it. I should be an investment manager, I'm not, I gave that career up, the true reason why is because I couldn't bear the thought of doing a nine till five job, my mind simply couldn't cope at the thought of my morning routine being messed with, I have things to do, and an order to do them in, a 9 till 5 job would mess with that.\n\nI've never admitted to that until now. But it's the truth.\n\nEven now that morning routine is the same- no, in fact, it's even more cumbersome, sometimes takes me four/five hours to complete. And every now and then with great mental effort I can break that routine and get up early, but it takes me a week, sometimes two weeks to mentally recover, sometimes a month.\n\nI've passed up on so many opportunities in my life over my inability to escape this routine, it is crazy. I always think, it's fine, I'll just fix myself, sort my head and be ready for the next one.\n\nAnd fortunately for me, there is always a next one, I just never take them, always for the same reason, which infuriates me. I planned to do extra work on TV and film five years back, but it involved early morning starts, and I can do so few early mornings, it took me to this year to actually manage to be able to do extra work.\n\nEven now, writing this, my morning routine has been messed up, and so I am actually writing this in an effort to distract my mind, because I am completely crippled by anxiety, and if I don't do something my head will erupt.\n\nIt couldn't even if I wanted it to, an obsession of mine is not to give in. And so if I do bellow in anger, it is in silent anger, no sound, no reaction. You could see me sitting there, I would look in complete peace, calm as calm could be, yet inside, I'm on my knees.\n\nAfter I gave up the career in finance, I tried to change careers, follow the dream job to become an author. I tell everyone I did this because I managed to earn enough money to allow a career change -- I turned \u00a37,000 into \u00a350,000 on the stock markets, mainly because it became an obsession to do so, and when something becomes an obsession, I will make it to the end, I can't not. No matter what, I will finish. Simple as that. I said \u00a350,000, and so got to fifty, and have barely touched the stock markets since, I can't. My mind won't let me.\n\nAnyhow, the reality is, my mind said if I could do a freelance career, then I could keep my morning routine intact. So the reason I changed careers was to keep my morning routine exactly as it is, if you saw that routine, you likely wouldn't see the order, but it's there.\n\nOrder is everywhere, and yet no one can see it but me. To other people, things can look in complete chaos, but to me, they are perfectly in order. Break that order, you break me, it's that easy.\n\nAnd OCD is not just obsession with order, that's not the only thing destroying my hopes of succeeding as an author, perfectionism, that is another part of OCD. I create something, it gets praise, but perfectionism takes over and so it is never good enough, so I keep working on it, and working on it, and working on it, until my mind can't take it anymore, can't even bear the thought at working on it anymore, and yet, I keep working on it to the point I often destroy everything that was good about it.\n\nSo to escape working on it, I start another project, a new obsession, but the same thing happens, as it stands I have five full length manuscripts written, none are ready, because I can't bear the thought of going back to them. Even the thought mentally cripples me, so they sit there, and I begin something new, because it feels liberating to do something new, until it does not, and instead it gets added to the pile of obsessions that I am afraid to come back to, and yet every single moment of every day all I can think is, I need to go back to them, finish them, make them perfect.\n\nTo try to escape this, I do something different, mediocrity, I focus on creating things that I'm not interested in, things that aren't very good, never will be. I also try to do activities I am not very good it, even singing. I can't be a good singer, so I try singing, because it can't become an obsession. That liberates me. So I put rubbish out there, not for the world to see, but for me to see. It's rubbish, but it's okay, because I'm not obsessed by it, but then I become obsessed by the idea of mediocrity, and so creating mediocrity becomes my obsession, it's like there is no escape.\n\nSame with photography, I started it three years ago, but rather than doing it more, I am doing it less and less, and I can now barely take a picture out of the sheer fear that it takes me so long to edit. A picture that should take five minutes to edit, now takes me an hour, minimum; a picture that should take me an hour to edit, I wouldn't even bear to think how long it would take. The level of editing I take it to, if you watched me doing it, you'd say what are you doing that for, it was fine as it was, I'd say I know, but I have to do this, I can't not. You'd say, that's madness, I'd say I know.\n\nI simply don't take pictures anymore, or take very few, and yet every moment of every day that passes all I can think is, I need to take pictures. And my only source of income comes from photography, and so I can't make money, meaning the only reason I am not on the streets is because I live at home and have very supportive parents. I've never lived anywhere else, it's impossible for me to, I have too many obsessions to be able to afford to move out, and I can't get a proper job, because the anxiety of my morning routine being messed with is too much.\n\nYet I find it impossible to admit that, even writing this my mind searches for excuses, anything but the truth. This can't be happening to me, not me.\n\nFifteen years I have been crippled by this and every day I become more crippled, fifteen years I have been running because it's an obsession of mine to run from it, and my reward for doing all this has been to end up with so many obsessions all I can do is just sit there, doing nothing but fret about how I am going to do all these things I need to do.\n\nAnd the only thing that can give me a moments respite is to find a new obsession to overpower the old, this post is a new obsession, writing it. It gave me respite, not for long.\n\nI literally can't do anything, I struggle to go to the gym, people think I spend my life in the gym, that's a lie, two times a week if I'm lucky, I'm just genetically blessed, I would go more, I can't. I struggle to read, struggle to watch films, TV shows, go places, do anything, it is literally an endless war. My mind is just so crippled with anxiety over how many obsessions I have, I literally struggle to do anything, I sometimes can't even answer the most simple questions. Hell, I used to be a math whiz, now I struggle to do basic math, not because I can't, but because I simply can't concentrate.\n\nSame with English, all that time and effort studying the English language, and yet now I struggle to recall basic stuff, it's not that I don't know it, I just can't focus well enough to recall the answer, and so I look in the mirror and I see a six foot two guy, blue eyes, ripped, someone with two degrees, and I just ask myself, how the hell can't I beat this.\n\nAnd then I tell myself I can, and I pull myself together, and I put in an appearance with the outside world, and they see me, and I become David, and no one sees the reality, because David does not have OCD, he is invincible, drifts through life, everything a breeze. That's the dream, not the reality.\n\nThe reality is, I am broken, and all because I'm obsessed with the idea that I can fix myself alone, that I don't need anyone. But I do, I can't do it alone, I realised this the other day, and you've no idea how difficult is for me to accept it, how bitter a pill it is for me to swallow, and it doesn't matter what people say about whether it shouldn't be or what not, the fact is, to me, it is.\n\nAnyhow, so I've reached out for help and I'm now getting it, or am going to be, I don't know when it will begin, will just have to wait and see.

Dogs are one of the few things that give me joy in life and I feel like I am on par with pedophiles and animal abusers because of this.  I just want to feel like a normal and moral person.  I have discussed it with my therapist/psychiatrist and he kind of made it seem like I wasn\u2019t thinking logically by lumping myself into a group with those people...can anyone help me?

I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone has had experiences like this, if this sounds like OCD, something else or a combination of things. And If there are any questions/comments anyone has that could help me better express what I&amp;#39;m experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote it mostly on the morning bus so it&amp;#39;s a little broken up, but it was taking up so much of my time I just needed to stop editing it. I&amp;#39;m concerned with POCD, among other things,  so in some places I put an * instead of the word pedophile. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve had intrusive thoughts since I was about 15(maybe earlier but this is when the most notable worry began) it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad then but that&amp;#39;s about the earliest I can trace this worry to. It became a little worse around 20 when a discussion unrelated to me brought it up again. Now I&amp;#39;m 26 and for the past year or 2 it&amp;#39;s been increasing. It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point that I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable whenever children are around or on TV. As well as images I don&amp;#39;t want to describe I also get my thoughts finished by intrusive ones such as &amp;quot;i like that child/young teen tv  character they are &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; when I wanted to think &amp;quot;cute&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; or anything positive really. Same thing happens with family members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I first discovered pure o when listening to a podcast about it and I immediately thought &amp;quot;holy shit this is what this is, this is what&amp;#39;s happening&amp;quot; it was the most I&amp;#39;ve ever thought any disorder has ever described what&amp;#39;s happening in my brain. I was not seeing a counselor or Dr. at the time so I noted it I my journal and didn&amp;#39;t seek any further assistance. After I noted that I felt a lot better about my thoughts having had an explanation, I didn&amp;#39;t feel I needed to worry about what was wrong with me as much as I had before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I started seeing a counselor at school and then a nurse practitioner and then a psychologist. I was diagnosed with depression and general anxiety(and in the past bi polar due to manic reaction to Paxil). Eventually I became comfortable enough with the nurse that I mentioned that I thought I had OCD.\u00a0 He suggested I mention it to the psychologist but I wasn&amp;#39;t as comfortable with her. When I mentioned it to both of them I was not specific at all and refused to be until nearly my last meeting with the nurse (I moved afterwards). He focused on making me feel better about the thoughts and didn&amp;#39;t speak as to their cause. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The psychologist(who I wasn&amp;#39;t specific with) didn&amp;#39;t seem to be taking me seriously and suggested it was oncoming psychosis. This may be so, however she consistently did not listen to me when I attempt to disagree about how I was feeling and accurately describe what I meant. Thinking back on it I can&amp;#39;t see and justification for this. I think she decided it was psychosis because 1) I smoked pot at the time, 2) I answered yes to &amp;quot;do you think people are talking about you or staring at At you&amp;quot;. I said yeah sometimes on the bus if people are laughing or looking past/behind me. Which I KNOW lots of people with general anxiety experience and I don&amp;#39;t think I experience this very differently from them. And 3) I answered yes to a question I didn&amp;#39;t completely understand &amp;quot;do you have a lot of thoughts at once that are hard to distinguish from one another&amp;quot; I was thinking about when I had panic attacks when she asked me that and I said &amp;quot;yes?&amp;quot; I honestly don&amp;#39;t know if this is true or not. I don&amp;#39;t have this problem any other time (if I have it at all) and when I have panic attacks it just feels like everything is so overwhelming, I&amp;#39;m terrified, my chest hurts and I feel like I&amp;#39;m dying. I wouldn&amp;#39;t on my own describe that with the words she used. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also noted that I reported feeling foggy and unable to focus/remember things, but I only felt this way after this way after being put on medication\u00a0 (cipralax then abilify) and the entire time I was reporting those symptoms to her I thought she understood that these were side effects of the medication and not regular symptoms I had and didn&amp;#39;t experienced before being put on these meds. It became clear to me at that time that nearly all of our meetings had been completely misunderstood by both of us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time with the kinds of questions that are asked when having an assessment. I don&amp;#39;t know how to answer some of them because I feel like they are relative. I don&amp;#39;t know how other people feel or think so it&amp;#39;s hard for me to say if I experience this more than normal. For example the &amp;quot;do you think you&amp;#39;re being talked about&amp;quot; question. I think everyone has thought this at one point. I know how I experience that it not very different from how friends with anxiety. We&amp;#39;ve talked about it and I can relate without having to think &amp;quot;yeah but&amp;quot; or &amp;quot; not it&amp;#39;s more/different than just that&amp;quot;. But my answer to this question is still yes , because it&amp;#39;s true, I DO think that sometimes. Should I have answered no? I was pretty specific that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they aren&amp;#39;t talking about me and that I don&amp;#39;t that these people have ill wishes against me and that it&amp;#39;s most likely that I&amp;#39;m very anxious that day. But she still saw that as validation for a diagnosis of psychosis. I feel the need to be as honest as I can be during these meetings incase I miss something and end up accidentally withholding information that is crucial. But after this experience I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m answering these questions right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m confused about the mental compulsion part. When I&amp;#39;m asked this question I don&amp;#39;t know how to answer. I have the intrusive thoughts but I don&amp;#39;t know if anything I do right now is compulsive. When I an very bothered by a sudden image I blink rapidly to try and confuse what I&amp;#39;m seeing. I used to get the intrusive thoughts less(I think) but I would think a lot about what it meant. I had reached a sort of conclusion that I had the potential to be* so I would have to be very careful with myself to not allow that to happen. Now my sort of conclusion is that this is OCD and I don&amp;#39;t worry as much that I could be *. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever I&amp;#39;m not so sure it is OCD I worry about what else it could be though. That is very distressing and it&amp;#39;s sort of panicking because nothing else I&amp;#39;ve ever read or heard of mentions this type of intrusive thought. I&amp;#39;m almost angry over the possibility that they would tell me it&amp;#39;s something else without an explanation for these thoughts. But now that I currently don&amp;#39;t think that being * is a possibility because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s OCD when they ask &amp;quot;do you worry about this&amp;quot; I will have to say &amp;quot;not so much anymore, but I used to&amp;quot; and that makes me think they won&amp;#39;t see that as compulsive worrying and say it&amp;#39;s something else(like the last psychologist). I also have other intrusive thoughts that have increased in frequency since moving in with my brother and I just try not to let myself think about what that could mean if it&amp;#39;s not OCD. It just makes me feel sick. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dreams have become contaminated with terrible situations aswell. I used to/still do have dreams about exes and then become consumed over if I still have feelings for them and if I did the right thing breaking up. Now my dreams include awful sexual situations that are just terrifying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also ruminate on a lot of social interactions. Things that happened years ago or things that happened recently. When I was was a kid sometimes it would get so bad that I would just cry hysterically and feel physical pain over it. Right now I&amp;#39;m taking welbutran and I find that it doesn&amp;#39;t get to that point anymore. I still spend so much time thinking about friends I&amp;#39;ve lost and how I would explain the reasons I think they aren&amp;#39;t friends with me anymore. I even think about what I could say to explain to people I&amp;#39;m not really close friends but were somewhat in the same social group. These can be pretty all consuming, it upsets me if I let it go on for too long but it can be pretty hard to stop. It&amp;#39;s frustrating because I have lots of homework to do and I can just sit there thinking about conversations I&amp;#39;ll never have. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also used to be pretty consumed by the thought of who I was or what life was. In high school I would get very surreal experiences of feeling/thinking as if things &amp;#39;weren&amp;#39;t real&amp;#39; like thinking that things seemed &amp;#39;like a hologram&amp;#39; or as if I could put my hand through the wall of I tried. And I would touch something to check and of course I couldn&amp;#39;t but I couldn&amp;#39;t shake the idea that it &amp;#39;seemed&amp;#39; like that. Sometimes this would be so consuming that I would just cry outside school instead of going to class. At that time I also self harmed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I periodically Google the different types of pure o OCD to try and see if I fit these symptoms and then Google other things that it could be to compare how I resonate with each one. I am anxiously awaiting my appointment with a psychologist at my new school, at which I expect to get a &amp;#39;yay&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;neigh&amp;#39; situation.. which is probably not accurate. But I keep &amp;#39;wanting&amp;#39; it to be OCD because that&amp;#39;s what seems to resonate with me the most and explain these awful thoughts. If it&amp;#39;s something else I don&amp;#39;t know that I would be able to accept it. It just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. While I don&amp;#39;t have ALL the symptoms and sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t take up as much time as I think it should to be OCD, there just isn&amp;#39;t anything else that feels like it fits and I&amp;#39;m honestly terrified that I will be given some diagnosis that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to fit and doesn&amp;#39;t explain these thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote so much more but this has to stop at some point or noone will ever read it.

After I noted that I felt a lot better about my thoughts having had an explanation, I didn't feel I needed to worry about what was wrong with me as much as I had before. \n\nEventually I started seeing a counselor at school and then a nurse practitioner and then a psychologist. I was diagnosed with depression and general anxiety(and in the past bi polar due to manic reaction to Paxil). Eventually I became comfortable enough with the nurse that I mentioned that I thought I had OCD.\u00a0 He suggested I mention it to the psychologist but I wasn't as comfortable with her. When I mentioned it to both of them I was not specific at all and refused to be until nearly my last meeting with the nurse (I moved afterwards). He focused on making me feel better about the thoughts and didn't speak as to their cause. \n\nThe psychologist(who I wasn't specific with) didn't seem to be taking me seriously and suggested it was oncoming psychosis. This may be so, however she consistently did not listen to me when I attempt to disagree about how I was feeling and accurately describe what I meant. Thinking back on it I can't see and justification for this. I think she decided it was psychosis because 1) I smoked pot at the time, 2) I answered yes to \"do you think people are talking about you or staring at At you\". I said yeah sometimes on the bus if people are laughing or looking past/behind me. Which I KNOW lots of people with general anxiety experience and I don't think I experience this very differently from them. And 3) I answered yes to a question I didn't completely understand \"do you have a lot of thoughts at once that are hard to distinguish from one another\" I was thinking about when I had panic attacks when she asked me that and I said \"yes?\" I honestly don't know if this is true or not. I don't have this problem any other time (if I have it at all) and when I have panic attacks it just feels like everything is so overwhelming, I'm terrified, my chest hurts and I feel like I'm dying. I wouldn't on my own describe that with the words she used. \n\nShe also noted that I reported feeling foggy and unable to focus/remember things, but I only felt this way after this way after being put on medication\u00a0 (cipralax then abilify) and the entire time I was reporting those symptoms to her I thought she understood that these were side effects of the medication and not regular symptoms I had and didn't experienced before being put on these meds. It became clear to me at that time that nearly all of our meetings had been completely misunderstood by both of us. \n\nI have a hard time with the kinds of questions that are asked when having an assessment. I don't know how to answer some of them because I feel like they are relative. I don't know how other people feel or think so it's hard for me to say if I experience this more than normal. For example the \"do you think you're being talked about\" question. I think everyone has thought this at one point. I know how I experience that it not very different from how friends with anxiety. We've talked about it and I can relate without having to think \"yeah but\" or \" not it's more/different than just that\". But my answer to this question is still yes , because it's true, I DO think that sometimes. Should I have answered no? I was pretty specific that I'm pretty sure they aren't talking about me and that I don't that these people have ill wishes against me and that it's most likely that I'm very anxious that day. But she still saw that as validation for a diagnosis of psychosis. I feel the need to be as honest as I can be during these meetings incase I miss something and end up accidentally withholding information that is crucial. But after this experience I don't know if I'm answering these questions right. \n\nRight now I'm confused about the mental compulsion part. When I'm asked this question I don't know how to answer. I have the intrusive thoughts but I don't know if anything I do right now is compulsive. When I an very bothered by a sudden image I blink rapidly to try and confuse what I'm seeing. I used to get the intrusive thoughts less(I think) but I would think a lot about what it meant. I had reached a sort of conclusion that I had the potential to be* so I would have to be very careful with myself to not allow that to happen. Now my sort of conclusion is that this is OCD and I don't worry as much that I could be *. \n\nWhenever I'm not so sure it is OCD I worry about what else it could be though. That is very distressing and it's sort of panicking because nothing else I've ever read or heard of mentions this type of intrusive thought. I'm almost angry over the possibility that they would tell me it's something else without an explanation for these thoughts. But now that I currently don't think that being * is a possibility because I'm pretty sure it's OCD when they ask \"do you worry about this\" I will have to say \"not so much anymore, but I used to\" and that makes me think they won't see that as compulsive worrying and say it's something else(like the last psychologist). I also have other intrusive thoughts that have increased in frequency since moving in with my brother and I just try not to let myself think about what that could mean if it's not OCD. It just makes me feel sick. \n\nMy dreams have become contaminated with terrible situations aswell. I used to/still do have dreams about exes and then become consumed over if I still have feelings for them and if I did the right thing breaking up. Now my dreams include awful sexual situations that are just terrifying. \n\nI also ruminate on a lot of social interactions. Things that happened years ago or things that happened recently. When I was was a kid sometimes it would get so bad that I would just cry hysterically and feel physical pain over it. Right now I'm taking welbutran and I find that it doesn't get to that point anymore. I still spend so much time thinking about friends I've lost and how I would explain the reasons I think they aren't friends with me anymore. I even think about what I could say to explain to people I'm not really close friends but were somewhat in the same social group. These can be pretty all consuming, it upsets me if I let it go on for too long but it can be pretty hard to stop. It's frustrating because I have lots of homework to do and I can just sit there thinking about conversations I'll never have. \n\nI also used to be pretty consumed by the thought of who I was or what life was. In high school I would get very surreal experiences of feeling/thinking as if things 'weren't real' like thinking that things seemed 'like a hologram' or as if I could put my hand through the wall of I tried. And I would touch something to check and of course I couldn't but I couldn't shake the idea that it 'seemed' like that. Sometimes this would be so consuming that I would just cry outside school instead of going to class. At that time I also self harmed a lot.\n\nI periodically Google the different types of pure o OCD to try and see if I fit these symptoms and then Google other things that it could be to compare how I resonate with each one. I am anxiously awaiting my appointment with a psychologist at my new school, at which I expect to get a 'yay' or 'neigh' situation.. which is probably not accurate. But I keep 'wanting' it to be OCD because that's what seems to resonate with me the most and explain these awful thoughts. If it's something else I don't know that I would be able to accept it. It just doesn't make sense to me. While I don't have ALL the symptoms and sometimes it doesn't take up as much time as I think it should to be OCD, there just isn't anything else that feels like it fits and I'm honestly terrified that I will be given some diagnosis that doesn't seem to fit and doesn't explain these thoughts. \n\nI wrote so much more but this has to stop at some point or noone will ever read it. I'm sorry I rambled on for so long.

Tonight, though, the obsession du jour is that I&amp;#39;ll never gain full sexual functionality. I feel like I have a little more sensation now than I used to, but I masturbated today and still didn&amp;#39;t come. It&amp;#39;s only been a few months, and I guess I need to give it more time, but there are some people online (as well as some mentioned in actual studies!) who claim to have never gained back the ability to orgasm, even after only having been on SSRIs for a brief while.

I now owe them money for the missed appointment and they were very unsympathetic in me having missed it because I was sure they would give me a call beforehand to let me know - as they did before for the initital assessment. The office was awful and rude and now I can't see this new therapist either. I feel like I am getting nowhere in recovery by myself and it seems every time I have an opportunity to get better and see a provider, something like my insurance being dropped, or a really shitty office policy gets in the way. \nI've found myself stuck in the rut of staying up until 4 AM then going to bed and sleeping for 12 hours and feeling anxious and like crap, ultimately wanting to just go back to sleep to escape it. Not sure what I should do at this point, I'm just hoping the obsessions and compulsions will calm down and let me get some peace of mind for more than 5 minutes. Thanks for listening, this has been absolute torture and I haven't befriended anyone with OCD who really relates so this subreddit is definitely helpful.

I just want to feel not so alone in this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been suffering from OCD for about 10 years. My OCD was triggered when i was about 23. I had a bad experience with a pot brownie and it basically made my brain highly paranoid and obsessive. I spent a few years terrified that I would ingest pot, acid or any type of hallucinogen for years. I was obsessed with the idea that people were poisoning me or I would accidentally end up eating something that someone put pot in. Eventually I gave up the obsession, I&amp;#39;m not sure what did it exactly, it started to fade after a while and I felt better (never took meds or went to the dr). In the years that followed I had OCD symptoms but nothing that was overwhelming or taking over my life (thinking that my mom and dad might die, doing tapping rituals, feeling better). I wasn&amp;#39;t in therapy and felt like I was able to handle my emotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few years later, I&amp;#39;m in my late 20&amp;#39;s and drinking excessively to cover up my general anxiety. I decide that pot is the answer to helping me feel more calm. I start to smoke small amounts for a few months and everything is fine. One day, I smoke a bit to much and panic ensues. Long story short, I find myself in the same exact place. Nervous about food, not trusting anyone cooking for me, stuff from the grocery store and of course restaurants (that&amp;#39;s a big one for me). I finally get on medication (prozac) and I get thrown into a manic depressive state. They diagnose me with Bi-Polar (with the bad reaction to an SSRI) as well as OCD and now I&amp;#39;m in an even bigger state of shock. They put me on Sereoquel (I take 200mgs now) and it&amp;#39;s helpful for giving me sleep, but honestly not much else (I worry it&amp;#39;s not enough sometimes but that&amp;#39;s another story). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a bright shining light in the year that followed I met my boyfriend who I absolutely love and adore (tearing up typing this because of how much I love and care for this person). Not only did he understand what I was going through but he had OCD himself and really understood what I needed and how to be comforted and ver the last year my struggle with food has subsided. My boyfriend and I moved in together a year later, share loving thoughts about the future of our relationship, discussing ideas about marriage and kids and things you talk about when you know it&amp;#39;s real. For a few weeks everything felt great - my OCD had subsided about food and I thought - &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve beat this thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the trouble with OCD is, you never really beat it. It all started with a thought - &amp;quot;My boyfriend hasn&amp;#39;t texted me back in a couple of hours. Does that mean he&amp;#39;s cheating?&amp;quot; Turns out he was napping! &amp;quot;My boyfriend asks me what time will I be home&amp;quot; - Does that mean he has someone in our apartment and they&amp;#39;re sleeping with each other? Come home and walk in on him masturbating. Clearly the reason he wanted to know. My boyfriend has some bruising near his shoulder - &amp;quot;Is that a hicky&amp;quot; I think? He doesn&amp;#39;t know how he got it but that&amp;#39;s not good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying we spend all of our time together. He comes home everyday at the same time, he is loving and devoted to me, he rarely makes plans without me and when he does he texts me the whole time he&amp;#39;s aways (not trying to justify anything, just wanting to state that he is a trustworthy human).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We talk about cheating after I get nervous that the &amp;quot;condoms are in a different spot&amp;quot; (yes I understand that is insane) and he assures me he knows we&amp;#39;re in a monogamous relationship, that he&amp;#39;s not a cheater and that he loves me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, I still can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling. At times I know it&amp;#39;s my OCD and at other times I go over &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; to make the argument in my brain that he is (these facts are not really facts as I&amp;#39;ve made up stories in my brain - he likes someone at work and they find a closet to have sex in. The only conclusion I&amp;#39;m able to draw since we&amp;#39;re always together).I think of what if scenarios constantly and worry that if I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;aware&amp;quot; of him cheating it will blindside me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not coming from a &amp;quot;bad experience&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve never had a relationship last this long, and I&amp;#39;ve never been cheated on. This is simply something I&amp;#39;ve put into my brain to replace my OCD symptoms.

Why am I not more sad, does that mean I&amp;#39;m gay? I was a little bit sad, does that mean I&amp;#39;m straight? When I talk to guys at parties, I feel pretty comfortable.

It just doesn&amp;#39;t do it for me. Then I think what if it is because I can&amp;#39;t find the right gay porn, then I try finding more gay porn. None of which works. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to matter, I&amp;#39;ll never stop thinking: maybe its just the wrong men. Then, I masturbate to women which I enjoy. I&amp;#39;m worried that I am now compulsively masturbating to determine my sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep noticing handsome guys and then envisioning myself in graphic sexual relationships with them.

I keep going back and remembering all the intense crushes on girls I have had going back to around second grade and how I was never attracted to any of my male friends. Then I think about how older kids when I was younger looked so cool and I wanted to be them. Was I actually attracted to them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if I never get crushes on girls again? Now I&amp;#39;m wondering if I am attracted to my male friends, I know which ones are ugly and which ones are good looking and I like hanging out with them, would I like it more if we were dating? What if I reach over and grab my friends dick, would I like that? Should I kiss him?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time I get an erection for whatever reason I immediately check to see if thinking of naked men makes it go away and thinking about naked women to see if it gives me an erection. Results are inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is HOCD even real? Or is it made up for people ashamed of their sexuality? Is questioning your sexuality a sign of you not being what you thought you were? Sometimes I get relief for a few days when I think about how noticing the beauty in things is a normal human thing. I like mountains, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I am attracted to mountains. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to matter, logic doesn&amp;#39;t help.

Every time I tried to have sex with her I got scared I would lose my erection. I thought it was nerves, as it was my first few times or maybe I was masturbating too much. This made sex unenjoyable. Then I started thinking: do I even like my girlfriend? Do I even like kissing her? Do I have to leave her if I'm gay? Now that we've broken up, am I even sad about it? Why am I not more sad, does that mean I'm gay? I was a little bit sad, does that mean I'm straight? When I talk to guys at parties, I feel pretty comfortable. I'm scared to even talk to girls romantically because what if it gets going and I cannot perform?\n\nI've tried masturbating to gay porn, I can't do it. It just doesn't do it for me. Then I think what if it is because I can't find the right gay porn, then I try finding more gay porn. None of which works. It doesn't seem to matter, I'll never stop thinking: maybe its just the wrong men. Then, I masturbate to women which I enjoy. I'm worried that I am now compulsively masturbating to determine my sexual orientation.\n\nI keep noticing handsome guys and then envisioning myself in graphic sexual relationships with them. At first it repulsed me, now I just don't know if it repulses me anymore and if I'm being desensitized to it. \n\nHave I only had crushes on girls because thats what society wanted to me have? I keep going back and remembering all the intense crushes on girls I have had going back to around second grade and how I was never attracted to any of my male friends. Then I think about how older kids when I was younger looked so cool and I wanted to be them. Was I actually attracted to them?\n\nWhat if I never get crushes on girls again? Now I'm wondering if I am attracted to my male friends, I know which ones are ugly and which ones are good looking and I like hanging out with them, would I like it more if we were dating? What if I reach over and grab my friends dick, would I like that? Should I kiss him?\n\nEvery time I get an erection for whatever reason I immediately check to see if thinking of naked men makes it go away and thinking about naked women to see if it gives me an erection. Results are inconclusive.\n\nIs HOCD even real? Or is it made up for people ashamed of their sexuality? Is questioning your sexuality a sign of you not being what you thought you were? Sometimes I get relief for a few days when I think about how noticing the beauty in things is a normal human thing. I like mountains, but that doesn't mean I am attracted to mountains. It doesn't seem to matter, logic doesn't help. I needed somewhere to vent.

So, working with a Doctor, I gradually withdrew from them and stopped them completely 6 months ago.\n\nSince then there have been some tough times but I mainly put that down to my body re-adjusting, and hoped that eventually things would sort themselves out. Within the last few weeks though my OCD symptoms have really ramped up - even the slightest thing which wouldn't have bothered me before is now a major cause of anxiety. I have made a Doctor's appointment to get her advice on the matter, but wondered if anybody here has been through a similar situation? I'm not averse to trying medication again but am willing to consider other things - St John's Wort perhaps? The more I read up on it though, the less convinced I am that it would help with OCD...\n\nAny opinions would be great - thanks guys!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "79g80i", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "6 months after coming off anti-depressants - Majorly wobbling!", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_79g80i", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/79g80i/6_months_after_coming_off_antidepressants_majorly/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1509308869.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/79g80i/6_months_after_coming_off_antidepressants_majorly/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "JSlash-", "created_utc": 1509280069.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi folks!\nSo my first medication I took was lexapro at a dosage of 10mg prescribed for OCD and depression. Back in January I tried weaning off and by the end of 6 months life got pretty ugly and I crashed. So I&amp;#39;ve been back on 10 mg of lexapro since august and it&amp;#39;s really helped. Unfortunately I&amp;#39;m having bad insomnia that&amp;#39;s still sticking around, so I take 50mg of trazodone for sleep. I&amp;#39;m also still dealing with general anxiety and some ocd. I also see a therapist and do exposure therapy, which has been helpful. So my first question is what medication works for you and at what dosage? The thing is I actually would like to increase my dosage but I&amp;#39;m just concerned about the insomnia. I&amp;#39;ve also been looking into genesight which does a genetics test to see what medication may work best for you with the least side-effects. I&amp;#39;m also curious if anyone has tried genesight. So from what I&amp;#39;ve read, lexapro dosage is usually higher than 10mg when prescribed for OCD, and I don&amp;#39;t want to try to keep white knuckling with a low dosage if I don&amp;#39;t have to. Also, this is a bit unrelated, but I&amp;#39;ve on and off had bad tension headaches throughout my life, and I&amp;#39;m sure much of it has to do with the mental gymnastics I&amp;#39;ve tried to play by compulsively trying to reason with obsessive thoughts and try to shut them off. When I came off my medication they came back strong. Unfortunately back on my medication again they still stick around, and daily, sometimes severe.

She used to be the main person I told things like this to, back when I first had a spike at 16, but this time I&amp;#39;ve avoided doing so, both because I know reassurance-seeking is counterproductive and because she has enough on her plate already (and her anxiety issues tend to feed mine and vice versa). I basically told her that I want to tell her everything, and while she seemed wary--she knows, too, that it&amp;#39;s a bad way of dealing with these things--she said she&amp;#39;d be willing to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just...she keeps saying shit like &amp;quot;no thoughts you tell me you have could make me think you&amp;#39;re a bad person,&amp;quot; and I just can&amp;#39;t quite buy it.

She used to be the main person I told things like this to, back when I first had a spike at 16, but this time I've avoided doing so, both because I know reassurance-seeking is counterproductive and because she has enough on her plate already (and her anxiety issues tend to feed mine and vice versa). I basically told her that I want to tell her everything, and while she seemed wary--she knows, too, that it's a bad way of dealing with these things--she said she'd be willing to hear it. \n\nIt's just...she keeps saying shit like \"no thoughts you tell me you have could make me think you're a bad person,\" and I just can't quite buy it. This shit is gross, and it will change how she sees me. That should make me not want her to know, but...I'm so tired. It's been over a month, and I'm exhausted, and for all that my therapist tells me I'm not a bad person, I think I need to hear it from someone who I've trusted for longer (though like...she objectively knows less about these sorts of things than my therapist does, for obvious reasons, so I should really trust my therapist a lot more in this regard).\n\nOh, and bonus points: thanks to the contents of one of the posts (which I won't remove from the version I'll give her, because it makes things make more sense), this will also essentially mean roundabout coming out as bi, which I honestly hadn't planned to do unless it ever became relevant. So that's  cool. Great way for that information to come out, in the middle of a screed about inappropriate thoughts about minors. Excellent.\n\nSomeone, I don't know, talk me out of this?

So, since OCD prevents me from doing things I want to do, my activities will be very limited until January.\n\nI guess this is all nonsense and there's nothing wrong with trying ERP on my own. It's just sentences like this from Chrissie Hodges blog stand out in my mind: \"Self-directed ERP can be detrimental if not done correctly or at the right pace.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there are also blogs that say: \"The GOOD NEWS is that you can do ERP on your own, if you are committed to it, and if you\u2019re willing to work hard.\"\n\nI even emailed Jonathan Grayson, author of Freedom from OCD, about this, and he said: \"Peter, I think if you feel you understand your OCD, self run ERP may work for you. The idea that you can better pace yourself is not a definite yes. I've seen sufferers move to slow or too fast on there own. Rather than making this another obsession, make it an experiment. Take a few months to self treat and evaluate the progress at that point. If you haven't made truly significant progress, than a good OCD specialist would be able to help you see what needs to be different. take care, Jon Grayson\"\n\nI'm just so worried I won't be able to function if I start doing ERP on my own...though I suppose I'm not functioning anyway.\n\nI'm worried that, for instance, I could try exposure on my own and this could backfire, making it so that exposure I do later with my therapist won't work! For instance, one thing I want to do is start a YouTube channel, but I won't because I'm worried it will be contaminated. What if I start it on my own, it feels contaminated, I refrain from deleting it in order to wait for help from the therapist, but because I did the exposure the \"wrong way\" then I will never be able to get over the obsession through therapy and the only way to get rid of my anxiety will be to delete it?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7955by", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Not going to therapy until at least January, stopped challenging OCD on my own", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1509130629.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7955by", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/7955by/not_going_to_therapy_until_at_least_january/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1509158404.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7955by/not_going_to_therapy_until_at_least_january/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "throwawei7892", "created_utc": 1509129604.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;after July, in which I experienced low anxiety and depression episodes because my mind was and still is conditioned by Derealisation and Depersonalisation, from which I recovered, apart from the thought problems.

Additionally I've lost both my mother and mother-in-law to prolonged painful deaths in hospice in the past 2 years.\n\nI took some time documenting patterns in my spiral, and I'm wondering if self-hatred/self-loathing can be an obsession. If not, I'm not sure what to call this.\n\nAlso writing this here because friends don't understand how a bad day literally becomes a call to suicide from my brain.\n\nI just kind of made a bullet point outline. Hope someone groks.\n\nSelf-hatred\n\n- The feeling I shouldn't exist\n- Shouldn't have been born\n- Wish I hadn't been born\n- Wish to not exist\n- Wish to die\n\nBody-focused self-hatred\n\n- Body weight === self- worth\n- I am undeserving of anything good because I'm fat\n- Denying myself food, even when hungry, because I don't deserve it\n- Anything I eat will only make me more fat\n\nThoughts of self-harm (VISUAL)\n\n- Images of slitting my wrists\n- Images of swallowing all of my medication\n- Images of shooting myself in the brain stem\n\nSelf-Worth\n\n- Is tied to perceived lack of life achievements\n- Is tied to lack of income contribution\n- Is tied to lack of job\n\n\"Don't/Shouldn't belong\"\n\n- Anything bad that happens to me is the universe trying to tell me I should be dead\n- I shouldn't be alive\n- I'm a waste of resources (food/water/air)\n\nSocial fears\n\n- Nothing even remotely complimentary about me is true\n- Anyone who is a perceived friend/companion is just pretending to like me out of pity\n- Everyone is sick of me\n- Everyone wishes I would just go away\n- Everyone is tired of my \"drama\" (see family deaths/job loss)\n- Everyone has lost faith in me, if they ever had any\n\nEvery day is a constant battle against suicidal thoughts/imagery/ideation, when it isn't a unending stream of self-loathing so intense I want to die just to make it stop.\n\nI see a therapist weekly.

So I always said no it&amp;#39;s not okay until a few weeks ago when I said no I&amp;#39;m not a freak and as long as they use a condom it&amp;#39;s okay. Well now I think that maybe it&amp;#39;s not okay because it could possibly destroy the family of these people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since 2 months now I get these thoughts of my sister again.

Sometimes when I get the thoughts it feels like I actually want it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the last days it felt like it is actually true but I was just hapypy trying not to think about it. Sometimes I get these thoughts and think I shoud masturbate but NOT TO THE thoughts but to porn. I told my therapist today still thinking that &amp;quot;come on, it can&amp;#39;t be true&amp;quot; but he told me it could actually be that I like my sister in a sexual way.

Then later I had a strange feeling in my pantsand I thought what if I&amp;#39;m aroused and it is because of my sister? I&amp;#39;m sure about these two things that at least the thoughts and the feeling aren&amp;#39;t false memory.\nI still have this thought and what if it&amp;#39;s true? I also walked around alone for like 2 hours on MDMA, what if during that time I thought sexually about my sister? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since I took MDMA it feels like it could actually be true a lot and I don&amp;#39;t want it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also get thoughts that have completely nothing to do with reality:\nI get thought like would I have sex with my sister if she needed to survive? I say she would need to decide if she wants to but it&amp;#39;s fucking disgusting.\nOr would I have sex with my sister if I would die otherwise? I say no because of the guilt I would feel afterwards and she would feel it as well.\nOr what if I needed to have fun during sex with my sister to survive? In any case me or her surviving I just cant do it it&amp;#39;s so disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why do I get these in the first place? They are so disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t want to be with my sister but what if I wanted to be with her during the last days? It felt as if I really didn&amp;#39;t care. And &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also get thoughts like what if a girl I liked or my girlfriend:\nWould have had sex with an animal or would let dogs hump her legs or would lick the asshole of a dog or cat.\nThis is just way too disgusting for me so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be with her or break up but why do I constantly get thoughts like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also always evaluate my morales and get thoughts like is beastiality okay or is necrophilia okay?

What triggered the situation that I will describe below is a misdiagnose by a doctor who wanted to perform surgery on me without doing ALL appropriate exams first and/or asking for my medical history. Eventually, I went to my personal doctor (and couple of other doctors as well), we did all the tests and repeated them for the appropriate amount of time and he told me that the original examination was a false positive, I definitely did not need surgery and I have nothing life-threatening. All of the tests came back negative. However, since I have the tendency to punish myself, I do not believe the doctors or the results. Fun fact: I am a scientist myself and I should know that should know where to draw the line regarding the validity of results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently I came to realize that my compulsions are causing my most of my panic attacks. My compulsions consist on me checking a particular area of my body for possible disease signs. The area the stupid doctor wanted to perform surgery. Here it how it works with my compulsions: If I give in, I either 1) get happy and satisfied for a short period (an hour at most) and then give in again. As a result, because I check myself extensively, I end up hurting myself unintentionally and I get pain that I get panicked cause I think that the pain is related to my imaginary diseases. or 2) I find a sign (pimple, scratch, cut, skin pore) that I think is not normal (always normal but cause I am not a doctor, I think it&amp;#39;s not) and I have to run to the doctor or the hospital (if it&amp;#39;s late at night). So basically my compulsion of checking myself leads me to either self harm and/or to more strong compulsions or both. If I don&amp;#39;t give in to my compulsions, I get extremely panicked and anxious and I think that the world is going to end and I have infected everyone I love and now everybody hates me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After talking with my therapist for over a year and given recent events, I decided I need to help myself get better.

And I&amp;#39;m no way trolling or playing around with you.

I once went to a therapist due to a week of constant mild to moderate panic attacks and he told me that I have an obsessive compulsive way of thinking. I don&amp;#39;t know if that can be considered OCD. Then, I became kind of recluse about my psychological issues and I haven&amp;#39;t been back to another professional ever since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my current problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I probably have IBS, as well, and even if I do, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it&amp;#39;s 90 percent psychological. Whenever I get stressed or feel moody, I feel a constant urge to defecate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, in this case, the pooping problem elevated to a whole new level of ridiculousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, while I was defecating (I have my own room in a different area below our house and I want to have full privacy and quietness when defecating), I heard a loud sound of something falling and then cats howling. That startled me and left me half finished. Yes, I&amp;#39;m not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever I go to the bathroom for number two, I get anxious about something like this happening again. So, apart from checking outside before going in, when I do start defecating, I can&amp;#39;t fully relax because, as I said, I&amp;#39;m worried whether it might happen again and stop me. That leads to incomplete evacuation and huge bloating afterwards which completely destroys my mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, I have to reassure myself that it&amp;#39;s going to be fine and that I&amp;#39;m going to overcome it in the following days. But it just doesn&amp;#39;t go away.

And I'm no way trolling or playing around with you. I genuinely need some help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could get into my history on why I believe I have OCD but I don't think there's any reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with it. I once went to a therapist due to a week of constant mild to moderate panic attacks and he told me that I have an obsessive compulsive way of thinking. I don't know if that can be considered OCD. Then, I became kind of recluse about my psychological issues and I haven't been back to another professional ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's my current problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI probably have IBS, as well, and even if I do, I'm pretty sure it's 90 percent psychological. Whenever I get stressed or feel moody, I feel a constant urge to defecate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in this case, the pooping problem elevated to a whole new level of ridiculousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days ago, while I was defecating (I have my own room in a different area below our house and I want to have full privacy and quietness when defecating), I heard a loud sound of something falling and then cats howling. That startled me and left me half finished. Yes, I'm not kidding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, whenever I go to the bathroom for number two, I get anxious about something like this happening again. So, apart from checking outside before going in, when I do start defecating, I can't fully relax because, as I said, I'm worried whether it might happen again and stop me. That leads to incomplete evacuation and huge bloating afterwards which completely destroys my mood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, of course, I have to reassure myself that it's going to be fine and that I'm going to overcome it in the following days. But it just doesn't go away. And when I'm finally half done, I start thinking of ways I should react the next time I'll have a bowel movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's so embarrassing to discuss it and I wouldn't be bothered by it if it didin't affect me physically. Which it obviously does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think that this is OCD related?

Sorry for the spam.Also it maybe triggering. /// ///I will try to describe my story as accurate as possible because everytime I feel like I missed something.///&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here we go again, my story started a few months ago (22.07.2017). It was a wonderful day I was outside, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, talking about my new project...everything Was perfect. So okay, I decided to see what is happening on my facebook timeline, I was scrolling and shit. Then the news about Chester Bennington&amp;#39;s suicide popped up. I instantly became anxious and the question which popped in my head was &amp;quot;He had everything, why he did it? What stops me from doing it?&amp;quot; and immediately after that I started having suicidal thoughts. For example: &amp;quot;A friend: Lets go outside tomorrow; My mind: Yes, If I don&amp;#39;t suicide by then.&amp;quot; and so on. I completely forgot about my other episode of OCD in which I was worried that I will became drug addict. So I googled suicidal thoughts and the result Major Depression came in(Chester had it.). I completely freaked out, I looked at the symptoms and there was nothing wrong with me. But I completely freaked out(I think I had anxiety attack, but not sure - My heart was beating fast, my vision became blurry, I felt like vomiting, my hands were sweating.) I came back home, didn&amp;#39;t eat, didn&amp;#39;t sleep. I was terrified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story continues the next day. I woke up earlier, I was extremely anxious, couldn&amp;#39;t think of anything than suicide. I tried to do some stuff to take my mind of. It was impossible. Short after that there was a feeling that makes everything feel pointless. That makes life feels pointless. I tried to argue with these thoughts, and rationalize them. It was impossible. At the beginning for the half of the day everything felt pointless, then I came back to my normal self, but I couldn&amp;#39;t stop googling. I was Terrified. I made depression tests online, they all showed no or very few chances of depression.\nI thought I had Major Depressive Disorder so I went immediately to my psychologist. He said that I am fine, and the problem is probably that I find something similar to me and Chester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay. There was a temporary relief, but then everything started over. But, then my mind started to tell me that I didn&amp;#39;t tell everything to him. The pointlessness and the suicidal thoughts continued.\nI started obsessing even more, constantly on Google. Trying to find answer to the pointlessness and the thoughts. And I started finding horrible stories about people who felt that life is pointless.\nThe more I googled the harder it became to gain relief. But I continued. I even googled &amp;quot;Am I suicidal?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How can I tell if I am suicidal?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Reasons why people suicide.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Inside the mind of a suicidal person&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Can a person suddenly become suicidal?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Suicide risk test&amp;quot; and so on.\nThe thoughts and the pointlessness feeling started to become constant, I am always anxious and constantly in my head with these 2 obsessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I red a lot about depression and how people with depression feel overwhelmed from life. So I it became obsession and I feel like I now I think/am afraid of/I don&amp;#39;t know. from life.\nI missed my exams and stopped attending university because 1. I lost interest in it(I read that also. But it is strange for me, like I have interest, but at the same time I don&amp;#39;t). 2. Because I am /Afraid of(not sure/) overwhelmed of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thoughts became more, and now there Is a dark feeling that makes them real and that makes life seems pointless it feels like there is a door between my old life and now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my obsession are many and too real to be OCD. I will list them here: 1. Why I don&amp;#39;t just give up and do it. 2. What if life gets hard and I do it. 3. Feeling that life is already hard and I will do it. 4. Feeling that I am becoming/became overwhelmed/bored with life and will do it. 5. I don&amp;#39;t want kids on this terrible world.(I read this somewhere, and for some reason I think that this means I am suicidal) 6. What if I no longer see a meaning and kill myself(accompanied with a dark feeling which I can&amp;#39;t describe that makes me think that I am suicidal.) 7. What Is the point of working for when I can kill myself.(This scares me the most.) 8. Intrusive images of me doing it. 9. Life is not worth living.(I never thought of that before I red it somewhere.) 10. Whenever I do something which proves I am not suicidal there are thoughts and feelings that makes it feel like I don&amp;#39;t wanted to do this. Or that doesn&amp;#39;t prove that I am not suicidal. 11. It was better to not being born.(Also red it somewhere.) 12. Why not die now, when I will die anyway?(Also red it somewhere and became obsession, and feels real. :( )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up. 3 Months later. I am constantly anxious (I think, there is a dark feeling that makes everything seem darker and pointless(including my life goals and life at all.) and is scary and makes butterflies in my stomach.)Everything seems pointless, I am constantly on reddit/Google trying to find answer/reassurance/ It feels like I am overwhelmed of life but at the same time I am not. The thoughts are still there. And this shit feels too damn real to be OCD. And there is a feeling that I will do it in the future which is (scary).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also there is a feeling that something is draining me inside. :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I was diagnosed with OCD yesterday, I felt almost fine, then started doubting it and the pointless, overwhelmness and the other stuff came back. Is it possible for OCD to feel real/delusional? Am I missing university/avoiding work because of depression, not OCD, or just OCD fear of feeling overwhelmed or REALLY feeling overwhelmed? I can&amp;#39;t tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. I also have trichotillomania.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Is it OCD? Am I suicidal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "///Disclaimer: This is my 5000 time I post here, but I need to. Sorry for the spam.Also it maybe triggering. /// ///I will try to describe my story as accurate as possible because everytime I feel like I missed something.///\n\nSo, here we go again, my story started a few months ago (22.07.2017). It was a wonderful day I was outside, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, talking about my new project...everything Was perfect. So okay, I decided to see what is happening on my facebook timeline, I was scrolling and shit. Then the news about Chester Bennington's suicide popped up. I instantly became anxious and the question which popped in my head was \"He had everything, why he did it? What stops me from doing it?\" and immediately after that I started having suicidal thoughts. For example: \"A friend: Lets go outside tomorrow; My mind: Yes, If I don't suicide by then.\" and so on. I completely forgot about my other episode of OCD in which I was worried that I will became drug addict. So I googled suicidal thoughts and the result Major Depression came in(Chester had it.). I completely freaked out, I looked at the symptoms and there was nothing wrong with me. But I completely freaked out(I think I had anxiety attack, but not sure - My heart was beating fast, my vision became blurry, I felt like vomiting, my hands were sweating.) I came back home, didn't eat, didn't sleep. I was terrified.\n\n\nThe story continues the next day. I woke up earlier, I was extremely anxious, couldn't think of anything than suicide. I tried to do some stuff to take my mind of. It was impossible. Short after that there was a feeling that makes everything feel pointless. That makes life feels pointless. I tried to argue with these thoughts, and rationalize them. It was impossible. At the beginning for the half of the day everything felt pointless, then I came back to my normal self, but I couldn't stop googling. I was Terrified. I made depression tests online, they all showed no or very few chances of depression.\nI thought I had Major Depressive Disorder so I went immediately to my psychologist. He said that I am fine, and the problem is probably that I find something similar to me and Chester.\n\nOkay. There was a temporary relief, but then everything started over. But, then my mind started to tell me that I didn't tell everything to him. The pointlessness and the suicidal thoughts continued.\nI started obsessing even more, constantly on Google. Trying to find answer to the pointlessness and the thoughts. And I started finding horrible stories about people who felt that life is pointless.\nThe more I googled the harder it became to gain relief. But I continued. I even googled \"Am I suicidal?\", \"How can I tell if I am suicidal?\", \"Reasons why people suicide.\", \"Inside the mind of a suicidal person\", \"Can a person suddenly become suicidal?\", \"Suicide risk test\" and so on.\nThe thoughts and the pointlessness feeling started to become constant, I am always anxious and constantly in my head with these 2 obsessions.\n\nI red a lot about depression and how people with depression feel overwhelmed from life. So I it became obsession and I feel like I now I think/am afraid of/I don't know. from life.\nI missed my exams and stopped attending university because 1. I lost interest in it(I read that also. But it is strange for me, like I have interest, but at the same time I don't). 2. Because I am /Afraid of(not sure/) overwhelmed of life.\n\nThe thoughts became more, and now there Is a dark feeling that makes them real and that makes life seems pointless it feels like there is a door between my old life and now.\n\nNow my obsession are many and too real to be OCD. I will list them here: 1. Why I don't just give up and do it. 2. What if life gets hard and I do it. 3. Feeling that life is already hard and I will do it. 4. Feeling that I am becoming/became overwhelmed/bored with life and will do it. 5. I don't want kids on this terrible world.(I read this somewhere, and for some reason I think that this means I am suicidal) 6. What if I no longer see a meaning and kill myself(accompanied with a dark feeling which I can't describe that makes me think that I am suicidal.) 7. What Is the point of working for when I can kill myself.(This scares me the most.) 8. Intrusive images of me doing it. 9. Life is not worth living.(I never thought of that before I red it somewhere.) 10. Whenever I do something which proves I am not suicidal there are thoughts and feelings that makes it feel like I don't wanted to do this. Or that doesn't prove that I am not suicidal. 11. It was better to not being born.(Also red it somewhere.) 12. Why not die now, when I will die anyway?(Also red it somewhere and became obsession, and feels real. :( )\n\nSo to sum it up. 3 Months later. I am constantly anxious (I think, there is a dark feeling that makes everything seem darker and pointless(including my life goals and life at all.) and is scary and makes butterflies in my stomach.)Everything seems pointless, I am constantly on reddit/Google trying to find answer/reassurance/ It feels like I am overwhelmed of life but at the same time I am not. The thoughts are still there. And this shit feels too damn real to be OCD. And there is a feeling that I will do it in the future which is (scary).\n\nAlso there is a feeling that something is draining me inside. :(\n\nP.S. I was diagnosed with OCD yesterday, I felt almost fine, then started doubting it and the pointless, overwhelmness and the other stuff came back. Is it possible for OCD to feel real/delusional? Am I missing university/avoiding work because of depression, not OCD, or just OCD fear of feeling overwhelmed or REALLY feeling overwhelmed? I can't tell.\n\nP.S.

over and i had to go back.Within that like 6 min. time span from when i started to go home and from the time i made it back to the restaurant,there is no way cops and ambulance came picked up the body or helped someone and then they ALL left....In 6 minutes.When i got there there was even a car in front of me in the drive through and they got their food and left like there was no problem at all....When i pull up to get my item,it&amp;#39; the same person as who gave it to me the first time 6 min. prior and she looks as if nothing ever happened.When i go around again i even saw an

went back and saw nothing............wtf\n\n\nEdit* I went to the fast food place again not to long ago just to Triple check......Sigh.I'm all anxious af for no reason.I feel like the cops may come arrest me for hit and run or something lol\n\nI don't get it.I have logical reasons to believe i didn't hit anyone,but yet part of my brain truly thinks i hit someone like wtf.When i first left the fast food i drove on my way home for about 3 min. and then the obsessiveness took over and i had to go back.Within that like 6 min. time span from when i started to go home and from the time i made it back to the restaurant,there is no way cops and ambulance came picked up the body or helped someone and then they ALL left....In 6 minutes.When i got there there was even a car in front of me in the drive through and they got their food and left like there was no problem at all....When i pull up to get my item,it' the same person as who gave it to me the first time 6 min. prior and she looks as if nothing ever happened.When i go around again i even saw an employee walking to his car....AHHHHHH\n\ni'll also add in that it didn't even really sound like someone yelling.It's probably me just overreacting.I went back to see if i could recreate that \"yelling noise\",but the best i could here was this little high pitch screech when i accelerate.I don't even remember what kinda of yell noise i heard.I would think if i hit someone they would have like hit my car or something and i'm pretty sure i would here that and i would here them yelling or crying for a good couple of seconds. \n\nEdit* Well it's the next day and i had my mom call the place and ask if anyone/anything got hit last night when i went and the lady said \"No. It's just a metal flap on the ground.Everyone runs over it\"\nEven after all that proof of me not hitting anyone,i still feel as if i hit someone.sigh this sucks.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null,

I call my mom and we set up an appointment and we agree to let me try luvox, as I have researched it and found that it is a first line treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder. honestly its going to be hard staying clean, but im willing to do it. i want to feel normal again, i want to be able to function. i have so many goals for my life, and i cant let this illness get in the way of that, hell no. wish me luck with starting a new medicine guys, i hope it helps with my anxiety and intrusive thoughts better than the zoloft did. honestly it kind of bothers me that I know that I will have to take a pill to be able to function normally because of a chemical imbalance in my brain, but eh whatever. people that have diabetes or trouble with blood pressure have to take medicine, most for the entirety of their life, so why should I feel any different? on another note I'm so glad this community exists, you guys are great.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "78bx0j", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "welp im going back on meds", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_78bx0j", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/78bx0j/welp_im_going_back_on_meds/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508831446.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/78bx0j/welp_im_going_back_on_meds/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "delirium_trigger2001", "created_utc": 1508802646.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;just wondering if anybody has like off days where you are just down in the dumps even though your on ssris&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "just wondering if anybody has like off days where you are just down in the dumps even though your on ssris", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "78bpv3", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "anybody else have reallllly bad days on ssris even after 8 weeks?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qvqm", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_78bpv3", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/OCD/comments/78bpv3/anybody_else_have_reallllly_bad_days_on_ssris/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508829476.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/78bpv3/anybody_else_have_reallllly_bad_days_on_ssris/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "nohunna", "created_utc": 1508800676.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/OCD", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.OCD", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "OCD", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m starting to use Brintellix today for my OCD.
