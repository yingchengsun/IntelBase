I&amp;#39;ve been on antidepressants since I was 10, mood stabilisers since I was 12, been hospitalised three times for depression/suicidal thoughts the past two years, and got my diagnosis of bipolar when I was 14.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for mania/hypomania to not be severe? Basically, despite my parents saying that now I&amp;#39;m on a mood stabiliser my mood has become much more stable, they (and other people, like staff members at school) don&amp;#39;t believe I have bipolar because my mania/hypomania isn&amp;#39;t severe enough. I&amp;#39;m not doing risky things like getting drunk, having unsafe sex, etc. However, my mania/hypomania effects me negatively in other ways, and it causes me distress which I would think people would take seriously? I don&amp;#39;t do risky things because I don&amp;#39;t have the means to do them, but when I say I&amp;#39;m having thoughts of doing unsafe things, they aren&amp;#39;t treated seriously and as symptoms of the illness because I can&amp;#39;t/don&amp;#39;t do them. My manic/hypomanic symptoms are just &amp;#39;misbehaviour&amp;#39; according to people. So me slashing my wrist when I&amp;#39;m depressed and saying I want to kill myself when depressed isn&amp;#39;t misbehaviour, but me getting irritated and picking fights with people and getting suspended is? (I get it technically is misbehaviour, and that bipolar isn&amp;#39;t an excuse, but I behave that way because I&amp;#39;m in mental distress, not because I want to upset people like many people who get in trouble do). I tend to internalise my feelings and intellectualise them which helps me stop acting on them, so when I say I&amp;#39;m feeling this way, I&amp;#39;m able to not act on my impulses which makes people think it&amp;#39;s not a problem. But you don&amp;#39;t have to do illegal things/get in trouble with the law/harm people in order for it to be mania/hypomania, right? It&amp;#39;s gotten so bad before I wanted to go to the psych hospital, though that was before the diagnosis so nobody took it seriously. Why is it that when I say I&amp;#39;m going to kill myself I&amp;#39;m rushed to the ER but when I say I feel like my mood is so high I feel like I can&amp;#39;t control myself any longer that people don&amp;#39;t care or bat an eye? I hate pulling all-nighters and waking up with tons of energy. I hate being irritable and snapping at others without thinking. I hate waking up at 3AM cleaning my room. Sure, my room could use me cleaning it more often, but that&amp;#39;s not the point! Having my mind race and being super anxious I hate so much! I hate feeling superior to others! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to do risky things in order to be bipolar, right? The only criteria I don&amp;#39;t fulfil according to the DSM is doing risky things. Just because I don&amp;#39;t act like a stereotypical bipolar person you hear about means I don&amp;#39;t have it? I&amp;#39;m on a mood stabiliser now so I guess diagnosis doesn&amp;#39;t matter so long as the medicine is helping, but I hate it when I hear someone say I only have depression and anxiety, despite my health records saying Bipolar 1. People who have just depression don&amp;#39;t become manic within three days of starting the medicine and having mood swings every three days, right? People with just depression don&amp;#39;t respond better to mood stabilisers like lithium and lamictal, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I realise this is me mostly ranting/venting (oops) and I apologise for that.

This is important to me bc writing is one of my coping mechanisms. I noticed myself becoming dull after I was put on ap's. I had to try with my writing that once came easily, and my creativity was squashed. I had difficulty with Intro English essays (college student). They absolutely helped with my depression, but I felt stifled. I stopped taking them in March bc I just could not deal with feeling like that anymore, and I'm starting to feel like myself again. Still on my mood stabilizers though. I am not demonizing ap's, I know every body is different, but I wonder if this has happened to anyone else. Thanks for your comments.

I don't feel like I have but even just the thought of someone thinking of me that way is enough to put me in a tail spin of doubt. The anxiety that comes from having to say \"I need this because of my mental illness\" is insurmountable. The thought that asking for something out of a pure need would be taken as an excuse to be \"lazy\" or \"unreliable\" is heart wrenching. Being particularly self aware and full of anxiety seems to make it a lot worse because I tend to just perpetuate the self doubt.\n\nI really needed to address how I was feeling in this moment, to some people I hope will understand too.

Then lamotrigine crapped out (I was only on 150 mg), and the episodes of depression came back. At this point I was pissed off and confused by the diagnosis, so I decided to stop taking Luvox, which I originally took for brutal anxiety and a depression that may have stemmed from the anxiety, or may have been a comorbid condition.

I just don&amp;#39;t know where else to turn. I went to my therapist originally for ADD and anxiety (which I have had since the age of 7 woohoo). I got tested for ADD that came back as inattentive ADHD, I had to go to the nurse practitioner and re-explain all my symptoms again which was fine, however she gave me something called trileptal stating she wanted to even my mood out first. I really don&amp;#39;t understand why.. Am I stressed? Sure I have a 7 year old and I am a single mom. Do I get irritated? Sure see above.. I have never been admitted, never had suicidal thoughts, never hurt myself..

I've done this so many times. \n\nI lost my job on November 18th. I thought I was well liked there, but then work started getting taken away from me. I got maybe a little paranoid. You can look at my post history to see everything. It's to much to type again. Boss said I suddenly changed, though I don't see it. I thought my conduct at work was normal for me, but I just wasn't fast enough after they hired a faster groomer. \n\nIt all exploded that Saturday because I didn't smile when I walked in so the boss confronted me, and when I went into a massive panic attack my boss joined me in the bathroom to talk... She said, \"I have anxiety so I totally understand.\" \n\nThe more I think about that, the more it pisses me off. She said it again when she called to fire me the next day. That she has anxiety so she understands but has to do what's best for her business. This, she said, in the same breath as she was telling me they're a family there and want the best for me. \n\nThis is making me angry. \n\nNo, you don't understand. Anxiety is NOT the same thing as being full on mixed bipolar I. \n\nI'm really wanting to passively aggressively post a meme to Facebook right now, but nothing encompasses what I need to say. \n\nSo hi... I'm new here, and I'm having a bad episode. I haven't been on meds since my late teens/early 20's and now I'm back on a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, and Xanax. I'm overwhelmed, I'm terrified, I'm broke, I'm sad, I have so much to do and no motivation, the thought of doing more job interviews and starting a new job makes me want to curl up and sleep, I have two kids and Christmas is coming, and I can't do this.

That being said, I would really appreciate y&amp;#39;alls &lt;em&gt;non-professional&lt;/em&gt; insights into my situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a 31 year old female. I recently began seeing a new psychiatrist who wants to diagnose me with Bipolar type II and prescribe me Lamictal. I however, am not so sure. I&amp;#39;m suspicious of psych meds and Lamictal has a pretty strong side effect profile. I do have a history of mental health issues, which I will attempt to summarize here as briefly as I can, in chronological order. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and give their opinion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - Aged 31, diagnosed ADD, GAD, and clinical depression since middle school. New shrink thinks I may be bipolar 2 because I started having depression very young, I seem to have had &amp;quot;mixed state&amp;quot; reactions to all anti-depressants, and I have a family history of bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;age 0-11:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;showed many &amp;quot;classic ADHD&amp;quot; signs such as hyperactivity, talking too much, inability to follow instructions, forgetfulness, daydreaming, poor social skills, no intelligence problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; anxious kid and did not adjust to school very well. I also had home life problems, which I think were driving a large part of the anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I remember getting obsessed with stupid little kid projects I had going on, like trying to build a car out of stuff in my basement, or writing a book about outer space, and then suddenly in the middle of being &amp;quot;in the zone&amp;quot; and in an awesome mood I would shift to a feeling of pure emptiness, boredom, and hopelessness... a dull blackness of feeling that would become familiar to me later on as one kind of depression. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;age 10-12:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have my first suicidal thoughts, they come on suddenly and intensely, like an obsession, I dwelled on the meaninglessness and brevity of life while fantasizing about shooting myself in the head and thinking concretely about how I could get a gun to do that. This feeling seemed to last for a long time, but there were occasional breaks where I would feel motivated again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;age 12-13:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;by now my parents have noticed that I seem depressed, and I&amp;#39;m doing really poorly in school. I get taken to a child/adolescent psychiatrist who diagnoses me with: ADD (non-hyperactive), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Clinical Depression. I decide not to take meds, even though my parents are open to it and the doc thinks I should try ritalin. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ages 14-18:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I decide to try adderall (prescribed) for the first time at age 15 in the 9th grade. I take 5mg in homeroom and experience what maybe could be described as a manic episode - feeling like I could conquer the world, like nothing could bother me, like I could achieve everything and anything I wanted, etc (isn&amp;#39;t this how adderall is supposed to make you feel though?). However the medication also quieted down my disruptiveness in class (talking, making jokes, fighting with other students, getting kicked out, etc) and made me feel less socially impulsive. I end up getting addicted to adderall to the point where I&amp;#39;m crushing it up and snorting it. After about a year I am able to quit by coming clean to my shrink and getting off the meds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I also begin drinking and smoking pot around here, especially after I quit adderall. I find weed especially appeals to me, and people around me start to tell me it looks like I am &amp;quot;self-medicating&amp;quot; with the weed. I agree, but I&amp;#39;m not sure which issue I&amp;#39;m medicating - anxiety, depression, inattention (weed often helps me focus, ironically, especially when combined with caffeine)? All 3?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I remain depressed with poor grades, and end up dropping out of high school at age 17. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;life actually gets a little better after I drop out and get a full time job. I&amp;#39;m still depressed but not as bad. Smoking and/or drinking almost daily, but not always &amp;quot;to excess&amp;quot;. I manage to do a few cool things around this age.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;age 19-24&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;at 19 I have some kind of mental breakdown watching the electric chair scene in The Green Mile. I was high from pot when I watched it. I&amp;#39;ve always had a huge fear of death, and I think that&amp;#39;s what set it off. I became so afraid that I lost touch with reality it seemed. I was convinced I was re-experiencing the emotions of being born. After that day, I was consistently out of touch with reality for about 2 or 3 months, everyone just seemed dead already because the lifespan is so short, and I could barely do my job (which involved interacting with the public) because NOTHING felt real and I was consumed by emptiness.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I snapped out of that mood one day in a matter of hours (less than 1 day) and suddenly become extremely happy because of the fact that I am alive and not dead. I remember how I felt that day and it literally was one of the best days of my life. I didn&amp;#39;t really get depressed for about a year after that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;at age 21 I begin a really positive relationship with someone that seemed to help me out a lot mentally even though I was definitely going through some minor depression and a lot of anxiety around this time. I&amp;#39;m still drinking and smoking daily, but not always to excess. I go back to school at community college.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;from 21-24 I do pretty well, with some &amp;quot;medium strength&amp;quot; depressions that I deal with by writing and recording music. I become very obsessed with writing music and sometimes experience the same feeling I had when I was a kid and in the middle of a motivating project and suddenly there&amp;#39;s a giant pit in my stomach, I&amp;#39;m swimming in emptiness and everything is hopeless. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I complete 2 years of community college and transfer to a 4 year school to study biochemistry. I become obsessed with science and doing well in school consumes my life. I battle a lot of anxiety and emotional ups and downs during this time, but I&amp;#39;m happy because I have a purpose and a goal (learning chemistry).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;at age 24 I break up with the guy I started dating at 21 and was in a good relationship with. The break up is mutual and we remained supportive friends. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;age 25-28&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;at age 25 I realize that I am gay/a lesbian. One the one hand, this was not a surprise because I was always a tomboy and other people often assumed I was gay. On the other hand, realizing I was gay was kind of abrupt - overnight, literally. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;still at age 25, I fell in love with a woman who did not return the feeling, and consequently went into a huge depression, even though I was trying my best to handle it like an adult and move on. Emotionally, I was kind of like a teenager when it came to handling rejection, because I had never really been in romantic and sexual love before. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;this depression was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad. I was practically bed-ridden for 3 years, and by about 1.5 years in I would say it wasn&amp;#39;t even about that girl anymore, it had just snowballed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was very suicidal at this time with low self-worth and I isolated my self socially.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I went to a school psychiatrist and was prescribed a bunch of anti-depressants, all of which caused me major nausea, insomnia, and what I would now describe as &amp;quot;mixed states&amp;quot; where I was extremely irritable, simultaneously wound-up and depressed, angry and sad at the same time... I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. I did a couple of out of character violent things around my girlfriend at that time like smashing plates during a stupid argument and punching the wall near her head over our bed. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The medication that ended up working best for me was Wellbutrin.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Around this time in my life I had decided that the main cause of all my problems is the drinking and (especially) the pot smoking, so my counseling revolved around quitting substances. I didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of luck with quitting substances but I did go to an outpatient program that seemed to really help with reducing my usage a lot. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the end of that 3 month program, I was accepted into a research internship across the country (I&amp;#39;m almost done with undergrad at this time) and about 3 weeks into that program the depression finally lifts. I come home a totally changed person - my life is still in shambles, but I am no longer depressed, and it feels so good!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ages 29-31/current:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I get accepted into grad school at the place I did the internship at. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I continue to use more pot and alcohol than I would prefer, but less than what would cause me major problems. Pot is really the main substance I use.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I continue to not be depressed, although anxiety is a big issue as well as minor &amp;quot;mood swings&amp;quot; where I will become depressed for days or hours at a time but not as bad as before and I snap out of it quicker. The weekends are always the worst - anytime where I don&amp;#39;t have constant structure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I start grad school and it goes pretty well, even though my girlfriend at the time leaves me and my dog dies. I can definitely tell I am not in a depression by the fact that I handle this stuff pretty well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I decide to go to a psychiatrist for 4 reasons: 1) to see if there&amp;#39;s anything I can do to prevent a depression happening again in the future. 2) to document my mental health issues formally/obtain a diagnosis in case I ever needed to take a medical leave of absence from grad school. 3) Because I was having a lot of anxiety and wanted to know my options regarding therapy and regarding klonopin (my ex had started giving me klonopin to calm me down, and it seemed to work with no side effects). 4) I wanted Adderall to help me with writing and reading for grad school.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The therapist decides that I might have bipolar 2, and he bases it off everything I have told you here, with emphasis on: my reaction to anti-depressants, the fact that my depression started so young, the fact that my moods go up and down a lot, and a family history of bipolar and schizophrenia.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shrink wants to put me on Lamictal. I want Adderall and Klonopin. He reluctantly agrees but only a 3 week&amp;#39;s prescription worth. He tells me frankly that he&amp;#39;s worried I could have a manic episode on the adderall. I&amp;#39;m not worried about that because I know I&amp;#39;m not going to take it every day, I&amp;#39;m only going to take it a couple of days a week.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;last couple of weeks:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The first day I take Adderall (10mg IR) I feel fantastic, euphoric, etc. I take it twice more that week, spaced out, but the effect wears off quickly as I seem to already have a tolerance. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next week, I take 4 days off, then I take it again (15 mg) and this time it seems to make me really irritable and I feel like the dose is not high enough. I take a day off, and then a day on where I have to take a much higher dose (25 mg) because at the lower dose I felt angry, irritated, and like I was gonna snap at someone. Agitated would be the word. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Then I take it the following day (25 mg) and on that day I do get some euphoria but also a lot of agitation. I begin to feel depressed that night, and I drink to reduce the agitation from the adderall. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day (last monday) I am heavily depressed, can&amp;#39;t focus, tired. I figure it&amp;#39;s just the effects of coming off adderall but it lasts through thanksgiving and it&amp;#39;s still here today (Sunday). I do feel better than before but I just can&amp;#39;t focus on this shit that is due tomorrow and I feel very emotional. It&amp;#39;s easy for me to tear up, everything feels either &amp;quot;touching&amp;quot; or sad. But I&amp;#39;ll have short bursts (an hour-ish) where I can focus and do work. Then suddenly I can&amp;#39;t focus again and I&amp;#39;m tired/emotional. I&amp;#39;m smoking a small amount of pot throughout the day, even though I keep telling myself I&amp;#39;ll stop (~4 hits, 3x a day).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that brings us up to the current moment. Thank you for your patience if you read all of that. &lt;strong&gt;My question is:&lt;/strong&gt; Is what&amp;#39;s going on with me normal? Does this sound like bipolar 2 or like something else? Is this just normal life shit and I&amp;#39;m getting caught up in the mental health system for no reason? Does it sound like pot could be causing all of this, or is the reason I can&amp;#39;t quit pot because I&amp;#39;m using it to medicate my moods? Is there anyone else there with bipolar 2 whose story sounds like mine, or do I not fit the stereotype very well? And what about the Lamictal? Any opinions on that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello everyone! \n\nFirst off, I want to say that I know this sub is not a place to ask for medical advice. That being said, I would really appreciate y'alls *non-professional* insights into my situation.\n\nI'm a 31 year old female. I recently began seeing a new psychiatrist who wants to diagnose me with Bipolar type II and prescribe me Lamictal. I however, am not so sure. I'm suspicious of psych meds and Lamictal has a pretty strong side effect profile. I do have a history of mental health issues, which I will attempt to summarize here as briefly as I can, in chronological order. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and give their opinion. \n\n**TL;DR** - Aged 31, diagnosed ADD, GAD, and clinical depression since middle school. New shrink thinks I may be bipolar 2 because I started having depression very young, I seem to have had \"mixed state\" reactions to all anti-depressants, and I have a family history of bipolar disorder. \n\n*age 0-11:*\n\n- showed many \"classic ADHD\" signs such as hyperactivity, talking too much, inability to follow instructions, forgetfulness, daydreaming, poor social skills, no intelligence problems.\n- I was a *really* anxious kid and did not adjust to school very well. I also had home life problems, which I think were driving a large part of the anxiety.\n- I remember getting obsessed with stupid little kid projects I had going on, like trying to build a car out of stuff in my basement, or writing a book about outer space, and then suddenly in the middle of being \"in the zone\" and in an awesome mood I would shift to a feeling of pure emptiness, boredom, and hopelessness... a dull blackness of feeling that would become familiar to me later on as one kind of depression. \n\n*age 10-12:* \n\n- I have my first suicidal thoughts, they come on suddenly and intensely, like an obsession, I dwelled on the meaninglessness and brevity of life while fantasizing about shooting myself in the head and thinking concretely about how I could get a gun to do that. This feeling seemed to last for a long time, but there were occasional breaks where I would feel motivated again.\n\n*age 12-13:*\n\n- by now my parents have noticed that I seem depressed, and I'm doing really poorly in school. I get taken to a child/adolescent psychiatrist who diagnoses me with: ADD (non-hyperactive), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Clinical Depression. I decide not to take meds, even though my parents are open to it and the doc thinks I should try ritalin. \n  \n*Ages 14-18:*\n\n- I decide to try adderall (prescribed) for the first time at age 15 in the 9th grade. I take 5mg in homeroom and experience what maybe could be described as a manic episode - feeling like I could conquer the world, like nothing could bother me, like I could achieve everything and anything I wanted, etc (isn't this how adderall is supposed to make you feel though?). However the medication also quieted down my disruptiveness in class (talking, making jokes, fighting with other students, getting kicked out, etc) and made me feel less socially impulsive. I end up getting addicted to adderall to the point where I'm crushing it up and snorting it. After about a year I am able to quit by coming clean to my shrink and getting off the meds.\n- I also begin drinking and smoking pot around here, especially after I quit adderall. I find weed especially appeals to me, and people around me start to tell me it looks like I am \"self-medicating\" with the weed. I agree, but I'm not sure which issue I'm medicating - anxiety, depression, inattention (weed often helps me focus, ironically, especially when combined with caffeine)? All 3?\n- I remain depressed with poor grades, and end up dropping out of high school at age 17. \n- life actually gets a little better after I drop out and get a full time job. I'm still depressed but not as bad. Smoking and/or drinking almost daily, but not always \"to excess\". I manage to do a few cool things around this age.\n\n*age 19-24*\n\n- at 19 I have some kind of mental breakdown watching the electric chair scene in The Green Mile. I was high from pot when I watched it. I've always had a huge fear of death, and I think that's what set it off. I became so afraid that I lost touch with reality it seemed. I was convinced I was re-experiencing the emotions of being born. After that day, I was consistently out of touch with reality for about 2 or 3 months, everyone just seemed dead already because the lifespan is so short, and I could barely do my job (which involved interacting with the public) because NOTHING felt real and I was consumed by emptiness.\n- I snapped out of that mood one day in a matter of hours (less than 1 day) and suddenly become extremely happy because of the fact that I am alive and not dead. I remember how I felt that day and it literally was one of the best days of my life. I didn't really get depressed for about a year after that.\n- at age 21 I begin a really positive relationship with someone that seemed to help me out a lot mentally even though I was definitely going through some minor depression and a lot of anxiety around this time. I'm still drinking and smoking daily, but not always to excess. I go back to school at community college.\n- from 21-24 I do pretty well, with some \"medium strength\" depressions that I deal with by writing and recording music. I become very obsessed with writing music and sometimes experience the same feeling I had when I was a kid and in the middle of a motivating project and suddenly there's a giant pit in my stomach, I'm swimming in emptiness and everything is hopeless. \n- I complete 2 years of community college and transfer to a 4 year school to study biochemistry. I become obsessed with science and doing well in school consumes my life. I battle a lot of anxiety and emotional ups and downs during this time, but I'm happy because I have a purpose and a goal (learning chemistry).\n- at age 24 I break up with the guy I started dating at 21 and was in a good relationship with. The break up is mutual and we remained supportive friends. \n\n*age 25-28*\n\n- at age 25 I realize that I am gay/a lesbian. One the one hand, this was not a surprise because I was always a tomboy and other people often assumed I was gay. On the other hand, realizing I was gay was kind of abrupt - overnight, literally. \n- still at age 25, I fell in love with a woman who did not return the feeling, and consequently went into a huge depression, even though I was trying my best to handle it like an adult and move on.

I consider this like I am hallucinating in my mind. I am on week 4 of Wellbutrin and it is kicking my ass. My sleep has been pretty normal up until tonight. I can tell it is Wellbutrin because it is due to start and my sleep is disrupted with insane distortions of thought. \n\nI want to stay on Wellbutrin and my Lithium level is not yet at a balance. Hoping that when the Lithium gets to the level it is supposed to be per liter of blood that the Wellbutrin will not make me feel so edgy and possibly manic? I don't know. I never get depressive episodes although I did feel suicidal for a second which was strange. Was it rapid cycling or something? They said antidepressants can make you feel suicidal. This was all in the last 45 minutes of darkness I spent trying to fall asleep in bed lost in this distorted head of mine.\n\nTL;DR my brain feels like it is going through a meat grinder. I had depersonalization where I fell off a cliff and was dead - all in my mind.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7fl6ct", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Distorted thought patterns - anyone ever get these or something like them?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1511678346.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7fl6ct", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7fl6ct/distorted_thought_patterns_anyone_ever_get_these/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511706030.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7fl6ct/distorted_thought_patterns_anyone_ever_get_these/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "dankweed", "created_utc": 1511677230.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been on Reddit before but somehow I wanted to reach out to other Bipolar people and tell my story which is actually a positive one, remarkably considering everything that I&amp;#39;ve been though. I became depressed around the age of 15 at school, really dark moods would come over me when I didn&amp;#39;t want to be with anyone. I called these depressor days, I had two other friends who used to feel the same way. At 22 I had the most terrible psychotic breakdown and was hospitalised for three months on a closed ward. I literally went completely mental at home in front of my family. It was what the doctors called an &amp;quot;acute psychotic breakdown&amp;quot;. So bad that they whisked me off to hospital straight away &amp;quot;to see what all this was about&amp;quot;. Hospital made it worse. I was terrified &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; were trying to kill me and my family. It was 21 years ago this December. I remember it very clearly. And I also remember how mean some of the patients were towards me, not to mention some of the staff too, but that&amp;#39;s another story. Basically I had gone from being confident and happy in my early teens, to lonely, introspective, rabidly ambitious, highly creative, angry, volatile and manic. My sister knew it. She knew I was ill. No one else could see it until I broke into a million pieces. On the ward I could barely walk due to the drugs I was on. The whole episode very nearly killed me. One night in my bed room in hospital, on the second floor, I threw myself at the plate glass window to try and kill myself...and someone bounced off it. I literally lost everything of my previous self. But slowly I recovered. I was discharged. I went back to college. Got a job. Moved out of home. Found myself alone again. Became ill again. Wanted to die. Was living in a house share in London with a mad old woman. It was horrible. I hated my life. I had no friends. No one to reach out to. I felt I couldn&amp;#39;t go home because I knew mum and dad expected me to be able to cope on my own. I was 24. But I had to go home. I was so sad all the time and paranoid people in the office would tell that I was mentally ill. I went to see a GP near where I was renting and he coldly asked me if I was hearing voices. I knew that if I said I was he would section me. I wasn&amp;#39;t hearing voices but it reminded me how the system worked. And I hated the psychiatric system of Doctors sectioning you if they &amp;quot;think you&amp;#39;re a danger to yourself&amp;quot;. I was desperate for help and couldn&amp;#39;t find it anywhere. When I resigned, my manager said kindly that it was okay, he could see that I had been struggling for some time. That was year 2000. I returned home. Dad was the saddest to see me again. To know his son was ill again. All my stuff back home on the dining table, my plants, my lamp. \nI chose to sort myself once and for all. I paid for a diagnosis at a private hospital. I went through everything with the Doctor who listened intently. He said I was manic depressive. No way I said. I couldn&amp;#39;t be. I was so saddened, shocked, angry, I felt tainted, faulty, third class. \nI kept it to myself. I went to the NHS and they got all the files out. They hadn&amp;#39;t seen me as an outpatient for three years. The kind Doctor said he knew what the problem was and he said he could &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; me. My ears perked up. I was bipolar. Really? that&amp;#39;s manic depressive I said. Yes it is he said. I was so gutted. I think I cried. He said it was okay. If I took the medication he was going to give me I wouldn&amp;#39;t have cyclic periods of illness, I wouldn&amp;#39;t feel so low and empty. He gave me 500mg of Depacote to take twice a day and 30 mg of Cipramil. I have been taking those drugs ever since. They have changed my life. No more hospital. No more Doctors....but the positive aspect of all of this is that I have been able to lead a fairly normal and pretty successful life. Having taken enormous risk with mortgage debt, buying properties through 2003 - now, I am a millionaire for what its worth. I am married to a tremendous, understanding and loving wife and I have two wonderful healthy children. Every day I live this life I remember my illness because of course it is part of who I am. I will be on the meds for the rest of my life and I do still get down, sometimes very down where I&amp;#39;ll stare at the horizon and tears come into my eyes. I crave peace. I do feel an inexplicable sadness. But I realise that being Bipolar is only part of who I am. It used to be all I was as I battled with it. And yes I am up and down. But I cope. I don&amp;#39;t drink at all. I appreciate the small free things. Materialism does very little for me at all. I am grateful to have made it this far. And I read about how many other people are suffering with this illness and the stigma and it does make me reflect on what can be learned from being a fellow sufferer. And the biggest lesson I have learned is not to be afraid of who you are. It&amp;#39;s not my fault. It&amp;#39;s just the way it is. And no I didn&amp;#39;t get to become the person I thought I&amp;#39;d be at this stage in life (well known actor, writer), but that&amp;#39;s okay. I got to be who I am instead. Lets someone else do the fame thing. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have coped with the intrusion anyway. I guess I stopped pushing against the natural flow of my life. I stopped trying to become something that life didn&amp;#39;t want me to become. I stopped trying to climb the ladder of life so hard that it was destroying me. Because whether it is genetic or whether it was the pressure I was under that caused that terrible breakdown, I will never know. But I am a very private man. I never talk about what I have been through, I never write about it. I tell no one. I am an island. It is my secret. Not a bad secret but still, it is no one else&amp;#39;s business, in this cold harsh world we live in, and certainly the business world, it pays to keep it private. The only advice I have is three fold. 1. Accept who you are and be kind to yourself, you are your greatest ally. 2. Accept that the illness is where you find yourself in this life, don&amp;#39;t fight it. And thirdly. No matter how much they zap the life out of you, no matter how much creative power they take from you, no matter how much sex drive they take from you, no matter how inwardly empty or dead they might make you feel, take the medication as an alternative to being at sea with this illness. My family loved me. During my illness. I was lucky. If you have a family, treasure them. If you have friends, you are very lucky. But take the meds. From the person you were before you became ill for the first time to the person you are today, you are the same but you are very different too. Accept the change. Today when I am alone I think of many things but mostly I think of the future. The past, some of it, was very painful. I can&amp;#39;t believe it happened. But the future is so much more interesting. Because I don&amp;#39;t know it yet.

So, it was put in my head that I would be getting an medical-related undergraduate course. When the time came for me to actually decide though, there was a small thought that I could try another course (I was, and am still, interested in fields related to technology) but these thoughts were quickly shut down with &amp;quot;you could do that while being a doctor&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re not forcing you but for us, we&amp;#39;d like you to be a doctor&amp;quot;, and other variations of this. Fast forward to reaching major subjects (around late 2nd year of college), I was breaking down almost everyday. I hated where I was in and couldn&amp;#39;t leave because of  a contract in my university forcing me to stay or else I pay to if I want to leave. Once, I had a really bad day and spilled everything to my parents. All they said was I could leave my course but they would cut off all support for me. Of course, I went AWOL for a few days in school after this. \nNow, I managed to graduate on time but the problem still persists. I hate my job and I hate that I don&amp;#39;t have much options for other jobs that my degree can get into. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving on, my family never really had good dynamics. My mother was verbally abusive, prideful, and had a holier-than-thou attitude. My dad, on the other hand, was hot blooded, quick to jump to (negative) conclusions, and was also prideful. My younger sister, I either talked to like a stranger or fought with for 13 years. And lastly, my younger brother is a child with special needs (GDD) So overall, &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; is very toxic environment and was never a safe place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was sick I&amp;#39;d get responses like: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too busy don&amp;#39;t add to my work&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s because (insert  causes from old folk sayings they believe in&amp;quot;.

If you stayed at home and drank water we wouldnt have spent anything&amp;quot;. In summary, healt is not a priority in my household.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been on the receiving end of much of the verbal abuses thrown.

In fact, right at this moment my parents are screaming and the usual threats of divorce or leaving the house are said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aaand to end this, here I am extremely lost and stuck in a place I hate (&amp;quot;home&amp;quot; and work).

Also I suffer predominant from mania, and I seem to read a lot about these medications for bipolar that treat the depressive aspect, which makes me nervous given my past history with Zoloft.\n\n2) I am terrified that a) my fianc\u00e9 will leave me when he realizes just how bad this can be or  b) I will do something godawful to him like cheat due to hyper sexuality or kill myself or self injure and leave him dealing with the mess and those two thoughts make me so upset, it\u2019s hard to get over it\n\n3) I\u2019m getting ready to start thinking about having children and the more I read, the more it seems like I just shouldn\u2019t procreate, which makes me so sad I can\u2019t handle it. I\u2019ve always wanted to take part in something I consider to be an integral part of the human experience, and it saddens me to read the myriad number of ways Bipolar can royally fuck up a pregnancy/baby/life\n\nTl;dr Feeling really defeated by Bipolar.

My friends and family are all in another time zone so with this news plus the end of a long-term relationship I feel more isolated than ever.\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7envzc", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Newly (and totally unexpectedly) diagnosed and feeling a bit lost", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7envzc", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7envzc/newly_and_totally_unexpectedly_diagnosed_and/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511350833.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7envzc/newly_and_totally_unexpectedly_diagnosed_and/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ohsovogue", "created_utc": 1511322033.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went to see the psychiatrist yesterday after what seemed like some more cycling.

Just have it on when the house should be empty? I can\u2019t find out the truth without objective proof. So if one day I come in and feel that feeling but nothing\u2019s on the camera I would know it was just paranoia. And then why is he so opposed? He just keeps saying it\u2019s unreasonable.

And he\u2019s trying really hard to talk me out of it. So that makes me think he has something to hide. And the problem is what if he is cheating on me? The only way to find out is to spy on him! But if he isn\u2019t, then it\u2019s wrong to spy. Not that I necessarily think he\u2019s the one who\u2019s coming in here during the day. But why is he so adamant?

Why aren\u2019t I allowed to prove to myself what is real and what isn\u2019t? Why is he so adamant about this?

Go me!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last few months (this quarter) my father has been absent from my life and in the past we&amp;#39;ve been very close. He&amp;#39;s a narcissist and has always made me feel like shit, and things got worse when him and his narcissist wife adopted a baby (he&amp;#39;s almost 60). He cut me out of his life completely about 3 weeks ago and then told everyone that I gave him an ultimatum to choose between me and his wife and left him no option (I didn&amp;#39;t give him any sort of ultimatum and have even had my therapist and boyfriend look through messages and emails to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t do this). It has been a stressful situation for me and I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time mourning the loss of my father in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister&amp;#39;s health has deteriorated significantly and she has been in and out of the hospital, including a month long stay in September. After receiving a pretty bad prognosis she has had some mental health issues as well. My family (including me and my boyfriend) have alternated care for her, including taking her to doctors appointments several times a week. My boyfriend and I have started to support her financially, and I&amp;#39;m having to accept that my sister is dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have been a little rocky lately after he was getting too close with a female friend. We&amp;#39;ve been going to counseling and fighting a lot and have been toying with the idea of me moving out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have these three big sources of stress on top of student teaching and full time graduate school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I haven&amp;#39;t been in a depressive episode or anything. I wake up easily, sleep easily, go to college, student teach every day, go grocery shopping, shower... I&amp;#39;m a fully functioning human being. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly stressed out, but I&amp;#39;m oddly calm about it. When I think about everything I&amp;#39;m so anxious that I&amp;#39;m sick to my stomach. I&amp;#39;m constantly paranoid about how I interact with people and the things that I say, especially when talking to people who know and talk to my dad. I&amp;#39;ll say something about my life to my cooperating teacher or anyone who knows my dad and think about it for days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve kept my anxiety and stress to myself. I come off as totally calm and having my shit together. My family and friends think I&amp;#39;m ok. I haven&amp;#39;t talked about my stress level with anyone except for my therapist, and he moved away 2 weeks ago so I haven&amp;#39;t talked to anyone since then, including my boyfriend who I live with. When I&amp;#39;m at school teaching or talking to my family and stuff I can ignore the stress and anxiety (except for some social anxiety) so in those moments I feel and look fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one area where I&amp;#39;m not functioning properly... I cannot do my homework. I just cant. I stall and I procrastinate and then when I start to do it I just can&amp;#39;t. I go to college on Saturdays and I was realizing how behind I am and started crying in front of my cohort yesterday. I just can&amp;#39;t do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is my not being able to do my homework related to my stress? or am I just lazy? I got an extension on my classwork because of my sister, but my other sister and mom told me that I&amp;#39;m just choosing to avoid my homework because they&amp;#39;ve seen me at my worst and this isn&amp;#39;t it. Is that true? Can avoidance be a symptom of stress even if I&amp;#39;m not showing other symptoms of depression? Or do I just need to get my shit together and keep up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel super overwhelmed by everything but I don&amp;#39;t understand how I&amp;#39;m functioning in every other area of life and just not homework. Maybe I just have senioritis? Other people are struggling with motivation in my program also, but still finishing assignments in time. I&amp;#39;m worried that I&amp;#39;m actually just lazy and being dramatic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr I&amp;#39;m under a lot of stress because of my family drama, a rocky relationship, and my sister&amp;#39;s health problems, on top of full time teaching and graduate school.

Was prescribed anti depressants, found they made me feel REALLY good and didn&amp;#39;t take any of the other meds. When I stopped taking them, I was on the verge of suicide. This repeated for months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I learned antidepressants were a no-go, i started drinking and smoking pot. I got on and off my meds almost every month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t quit drinking, but I finally decided to give my meds a real try. After a night of binging (6 days ago) I quit drinking--and decided to ask my doc if I could move my meds to the therapeutic dosage. I knew something had to change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it did, maybe because 6 days is the longest I&amp;#39;ve been without drinking in months, maybe because my meds are finally working, maybe meditation--maybe a compound of all of these. I never thought I&amp;#39;d be stable. Meds seemed to make me worse, and so I let myself go thinking my life would never come back either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always wondered what was manic me and what was stable me. Now I know. I understand the difference. It is mania to drive to work laughing your ass of thinking the world was made for you. It is mania to break up with someone and get into a relationship within 3 days. It&amp;#39;s mania to spend 20k of your savings in 4 months. It&amp;#39;s mania to drink and smoke every night and go to work reeking but still SO HAPPY. It is mania to go days without eating and sleeping 2-4 hours a night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is normal to wake up early in the morning and make tea. It is normal to bring lunch to work. It is normal to make attainable, rational goals. It is normal to feel content, peaceful. It is normal to get upset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before the antidepressants, the mania was much less marked. I&amp;#39;d call it hypomania. So I never knew if I was in a &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; state or a &amp;#39;manic&amp;#39; state. Now I know the difference, and it feels so fucking good--not in a manic, euphoric way--but a feeling or relief, of peace, acceptance. A feeling of being able to experience real emotions again--not the kind that overwhelm your senses and blind everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s a long road ahead, I know I&amp;#39;m not out of the water yet. I know I will always have bipolar disorder, will always be an alcoholic, will always have a host of other issues stemming from trauma. But having my chemicals even somewhat evened out is a world of difference--one I haven&amp;#39;t had since January with the antidepressants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One things I&amp;#39;ve learned--it takes effort. It&amp;#39;s hard. Staying on my meds was hard, but it was the first step. And I think it just takes that first step, that first commitment, and it makes the others easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might relapse, I might stop taking my meds, I might go through a spell even worse than this one. But I think it&amp;#39;s an important lesson--that it is possible to feel this way, to get back here. That there is hope, something I had given up on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never thought it would be possible, not even for 6 days. And there is nothing that will keep me fighting harder. I hope the lessons keep coming, I hope the habits keep building.  I hope that I continue to fight. And I KNOW that it&amp;#39;s possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I know it seems stupid to say that 4 days can make a difference, but something has switched.\n\nI have been swinging wildly for almost a year now. Was prescribed anti depressants, found they made me feel REALLY good and didn't take any of the other meds. When I stopped taking them, I was on the verge of suicide. This repeated for months.\n\nWhen I learned antidepressants were a no-go, i started drinking and smoking pot. I got on and off my meds almost every month.\n\nI didn't quit drinking, but I finally decided to give my meds a real try. After a night of binging (6 days ago) I quit drinking--and decided to ask my doc if I could move my meds to the therapeutic dosage. I knew something had to change.\n\nAnd it did, maybe because 6 days is the longest I've been without drinking in months, maybe because my meds are finally working, maybe meditation--maybe a compound of all of these. I never thought I'd be stable. Meds seemed to make me worse, and so I let myself go thinking my life would never come back either way.\n\nI always wondered what was manic me and what was stable me. Now I know. I understand the difference. It is mania to drive to work laughing your ass of thinking the world was made for you. It is mania to break up with someone and get into a relationship within 3 days. It's mania to spend 20k of your savings in 4 months. It's mania to drink and smoke every night and go to work reeking but still SO HAPPY. It is mania to go days without eating and sleeping 2-4 hours a night.\n\nIt is normal to wake up early in the morning and make tea. It is normal to bring lunch to work. It is normal to make attainable, rational goals. It is normal to feel content, peaceful. It is normal to get upset. \n\nBefore the antidepressants, the mania was much less marked. I'd call it hypomania. So I never knew if I was in a 'normal' state or a 'manic' state. Now I know the difference, and it feels so fucking good--not in a manic, euphoric way--but a feeling or relief, of peace, acceptance. A feeling of being able to experience real emotions again--not the kind that overwhelm your senses and blind everything else.\n\n\nI know it's a long road ahead, I know I'm not out of the water yet. I know I will always have bipolar disorder, will always be an alcoholic, will always have a host of other issues stemming from trauma. But having my chemicals even somewhat evened out is a world of difference--one I haven't had since January with the antidepressants. \n\nOne things I've learned--it takes effort. It's hard. Staying on my meds was hard, but it was the first step. And I think it just takes that first step, that first commitment, and it makes the others easier.\n\nI might relapse, I might stop taking my meds, I might go through a spell even worse than this one. But I think it's an important lesson--that it is possible to feel this way, to get back here. That there is hope, something I had given up on.\n\n I never thought it would be possible, not even for 6 days. And there is nothing that will keep me fighting harder. I hope the lessons keep coming, I hope the habits keep building.  I hope that I continue to fight. And I KNOW that it's possible.

Off my meds I could find interest in so many things and get excited about them. Completely focus on them usually to the detriment of my responsibilities such as work. But at least there was passion.  At least with some of the not so moral behavior I could get past the hurt. Get complete wrapped up in something knew and not let any of lifes negativity get me down. Its easy to lose sight of the consequences though, which I guess I should just keep reminding myself of.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that she's quit taking her meds. I'm ADHD and BP2 where shes BPD and BP1. Ohhh and boy did she get pissed and throw out the \"how dare you's\" when I mentioned that she should be on her meds. So why should I stay on mine? I want to feel again too! I want to have my ups back! I want to be able to make my hurt away!

As the title says, it seems like everything is falling apart all over again. I was misdiagnosed several years ago, and everything continued in a downward spiral for a few years to the point where I had to drop out of school for medical reasons, lost contact with almost all my friends, became very estranged from my family... No one could deal with me they said, I was too unpredictable and unreliable, my moods were all over the place, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of years and I found a doctor who fairly quickly realized I&amp;#39;d been misdiagnosed after the last 2 doctors I had seen literally told me that they couldn&amp;#39;t help me because they didn&amp;#39;t know what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been on meds and in therapy for a few years and things have been up and down the entire time. I&amp;#39;ve quite literally tried nearly every med on the market (as well as combo drug therapies). I either have horrible side effects, no effects at all, or occasionally something helps for a while and then it slowly stops. Currently I&amp;#39;m on quite the cocktail of meds and they seem to be working less and less again. I&amp;#39;ve talked to my doctor and even he&amp;#39;s pretty concerned because he&amp;#39;s not sure what meds might need to be changed. We&amp;#39;ve done blood tests to check med levels, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the meds aren&amp;#39;t working well anymore things are falling apart again. I&amp;#39;ve done a medical leave of absence from grad school and from work to try to get back on track without these major stressors. I&amp;#39;ve gained a ton of weight despite the fact that I barely eat anything and sleep way too much everyday. But even doing that isn&amp;#39;t helping this time around. Basically the only thing I haven&amp;#39;t tried is in-patient treatment because my doctors both think I&amp;#39;d be even more miserable and it would be counter productive...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to do or where to turn to. I don&amp;#39;t want to switch doctors again because I&amp;#39;ve been working with this duo for almost 3 years and they&amp;#39;ve helped me a lot... This time we can&amp;#39;t seem to get things back on track though...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do things ever get better and stay that way?

I was misdiagnosed several years ago, and everything continued in a downward spiral for a few years to the point where I had to drop out of school for medical reasons, lost contact with almost all my friends, became very estranged from my family... No one could deal with me they said, I was too unpredictable and unreliable, my moods were all over the place, etc.\n\nFast forward a couple of years and I found a doctor who fairly quickly realized I'd been misdiagnosed after the last 2 doctors I had seen literally told me that they couldn't help me because they didn't know what was wrong.\n\nSo I've been on meds and in therapy for a few years and things have been up and down the entire time. I've quite literally tried nearly every med on the market (as well as combo drug therapies). I either have horrible side effects, no effects at all, or occasionally something helps for a while and then it slowly stops. Currently I'm on quite the cocktail of meds and they seem to be working less and less again. I've talked to my doctor and even he's pretty concerned because he's not sure what meds might need to be changed. We've done blood tests to check med levels, etc.\n\nSince the meds aren't working well anymore things are falling apart again. I've done a medical leave of absence from grad school and from work to try to get back on track without these major stressors. I've gained a ton of weight despite the fact that I barely eat anything and sleep way too much everyday. But even doing that isn't helping this time around. Basically the only thing I haven't tried is in-patient treatment because my doctors both think I'd be even more miserable and it would be counter productive...\n\nI have no idea what to do or where to turn to. I don't want to switch doctors again because I've been working with this duo for almost 3 years and they've helped me a lot... This time we can't seem to get things back on track though...\n\nDo things ever get better and stay that way? I know it's a life long battle but can't there be some sense of control I can get over this disease?!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7ctkbt", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Everything falling apart all over again", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7ctkbt", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7ctkbt/everything_falling_apart_all_over_again/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1510667121.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7ctkbt/everything_falling_apart_all_over_again/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "cirquerouge", "created_utc": 1510638321.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All least week I felt it coming.

But anyway I took my meds and she asked, and because I haven't known her long and I didn't know how she'd react I told her I'd rather not say what the meds were. Another back and forth and I told her it was for my bipolar. She was totally unfazed.\n\n\"You know I honestly don't know much about it. Can you tell me about it?\" Followed by a bunch of \"yeah I experienced a week of depression one time\" and \"I sometimes do stupidly impulsive things.\" Which although frustrating in a way, came from a really sweet place.

I've \"come out\" to a lot of people and only ever regretted telling one person, and it sure as hell wasn't anyone I've been on a date with.\n\nI'm glad I told her.

However, I don't believe those things are moods as they depends on external factors and they are not pervasive.\n\n\n\nIt would also explain why NTs have no earthly idea what the devastation of depression feels like as they only have their 'tinted feelings' to relate to. And those feelings they are able to relate to a certain event. Or why they don't get what the big deal with mania is as they relate it to a personal choice they may have made to \"have fun.\" The only one they seem to get is psychosis--because they have no point of reference. What I'm thinking is that they don't really have a point of reference for any of the moods that we have.\n\n\n\nNot trying to say I'm right--but I thought the conversation interesting as I've never thought about it before.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7arh3w", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Difference between moods that we experience vs the feelings of those without bipolar", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1509811543.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7arh3w", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7arh3w/difference_between_moods_that_we_experience_vs/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1509840154.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7arh3w/difference_between_moods_that_we_experience_vs/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "uhohuhohuhohuhohuh", "created_utc": 1509811354.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone know if there\u2019s a difference between the two meds?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Anyone know if there\u2019s a difference between the two meds?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7avb8i", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Can\u2019t find any medical reports that state whether Lithium or Lamictal is worse for short term memory.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 9, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_7avb8i", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7avb8i/cant_find_any_medical_reports_that_state_whether/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1509880790.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/7avb8i/cant_find_any_medical_reports_that_state_whether/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "grey_unknown", "created_utc": 1509851990.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve known this guy for 8 years and he hasn&amp;#39;t been diagnosed, but after reading a few blogs and medical webpages, they all read like the story of his life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We met when I was &amp;quot;dating&amp;quot; someone he knew, and I mean we had a really intangible connection.

Klonopin too, but there&amp;#39;s a high risk for addiction (you&amp;#39;re going to learn is a thing from peanut-eating future roommate.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, for some good news. The college you want to transfer to? You got in. You did pretty well for a while. You struggled to make friends at first. Not just cause you&amp;#39;re... WE&amp;#39;RE... kinda weird, but you weren&amp;#39;t rich like these kids were. Eventually you&amp;#39;ll find your crew. Yeah, my dude, future Reaper has an actual REAL LIFE FRIEND GROUP. Dudes from all over the world. You&amp;#39;ll meet some locals, too, who you&amp;#39;ll also become friends with. These guys will teach you a lot - specifically that you don&amp;#39;t need to have a college degree to have a fulfilling life. They&amp;#39;ll help you &amp;quot;find yourself&amp;quot;, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m warning you. You&amp;#39;ll fuck up a lot in school. You&amp;#39;ll do a few too many drugs. You&amp;#39;ll get in with some fucked up people. Several of your friends will be arrested. A few of them will end up being heroin addicts (that&amp;#39;s the one drug you won&amp;#39;t do.) A few of them will serve time in prison. You&amp;#39;ll come one class away from graduating, and run out of money. You&amp;#39;ll fall into depression, then go back into mania when you think you&amp;#39;ve figured it out again. And you&amp;#39;ll look at her, the woman who gave birth to you, and start to notice some of the same things...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s dead now. She finally drank herself to death. You knew it was coming, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t divorce like you thought they would. But long gone is the comfortable middle class status you grew up with. She blew through all her money. You were right all along - she was trying to take advantage of you. But you shouldn&amp;#39;t have cared so much, because just because you&amp;#39;re diagnosed with a mental disorder... doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;ll have to be dependent on the government for the rest of your life. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t do this or that. Sure some things might be a bit harder for you, but you&amp;#39;ll get to do a lot of things most people don&amp;#39;t get to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what HAVE you done? You&amp;#39;ve interviewed some famous musicians for your college newspaper. You somehow managed an entire semester in college while you were technically homeless. You&amp;#39;ve made friends with the local music scene (and lived with) a semi-famous band. Fuck, you even had a stint as a commercial fisherman with Cousin (spoiler: he&amp;#39;s even creepier than you already think.) Oh, and you have six tattoos now, including a full sleeve. Didn&amp;#39;t expect THAT one, did you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, Lil Reaper, I&amp;#39;m writing to you today because this was the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; day you became an orphan. And so much of your sadness will stem from the fact that no one will love you like that woman did. Not your parents. Not your sisters. Not your extended family. No girl you ever try to date (don&amp;#39;t even ask about that...) No one from your hometown. Yeah, your hometown, this semi-idyllic 1950s neighborhood of Split Levels and Cape Cods, where you could always run a few streets away to her house when things got bad. Then grandma&amp;#39;s about a mile down the road, where your mother&amp;#39;s family carried 60+ years of alcoholism and general dysfunction. So you&amp;#39;re leaving all the shit behind. You will spend this day ten years from now throwing away everything in the house as your dad prepares to move into a guest room at the house that belonged to HIS mother, nearly half an hour from here. And you go... somewhere. Yeah homie, you&amp;#39;re finally on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell you, though. Wherever I (we) go, I still have hope. We&amp;#39;re losing everything right now, so you might think I&amp;#39;m delusional. But those external measures of success that you&amp;#39;re so obsessed with... those things you thought you had to accomplish to be &amp;quot;worthwhile&amp;quot;... you&amp;#39;ll realize how little they actually matter once they basically disappear. Your place in society will completely change. Yet you&amp;#39;ll find a life that&amp;#39;s so much simpler and... happiness will just be so much simpler. And someone will find you, and learn to love you (as you are, NOT the way they want you to be.) I mean, I still haven&amp;#39;t found her yet... but I know we will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much love lil bro,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~Reaper O&amp;#39;Souls, 11/3/2017&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Oh and just so you know, Soulja Boy ended up being a one-hit wonder. Thank fucking god.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "What's good homie? It's me... I mean it's YOU. I'm basically talking to myself here. But for you, it's November 3, 2007... exactly ten years later from where you are right now. You won't actually see this, but I'm hoping you, and all your hopes and dreams for the future, can come back to me. Because I really need you right now.\n\nSo why today, of all days? Because... and you knew this was gonna happen... but Nana died. You won't find out for another three days when you read the obituaries online. Fucking pathetic way to find out, huh? This woman took you in and raised you and your sister as her own (grand)kids, and you won't so much as see a picture of her ever again. But she will visit you in your dreams, where you once again find yourself in your childhood \"home\" surrounded by all the love and comfort that you won't really find again. You'll be lucky. Not cause it's gone, but that you had it in the first place.\n\nI know you had a rough week in the hospital, staying overnight for the first time (the only time you'll ever do that again is in a psych ward!) But the Red Sox won the World Series for the second time (spoiler alert: they win again in 2013! You'll be working an overnight shift at Target when that happens.) Your roommate is an asshole. It'll take you two room switches before you end up with a decent one. And that guy will smoke pot all day and eat peanuts and throw the shells all over the floor. But you take what you can get, I guess.\n\nYou're on your own now, my dude. And I hate to tell you this, but it's gonna get a hell of a lot harder.\n\nIn just a few months, you'll start researching bipolar disorder. You definitely thought you had that at some point, right? It'll be another several years before you're formally diagnosed with it, but you'll be living it hardcore. You know how with Celexa and Lexapro you didn't get better, you got louder and weirder and dumber? That's why.\n\nYou're not going to have an easy time with psychiatrists, so you'll experiment with a bunch of drugs... not all of which will be from doctors. Oh yeah, future you is a huge fucking stoner. He also chain smokes cigarettes, but just switched to vaping (oh you don't know what that is yet, right? Yeah, you'll find out.) Eventually, Wellbutrin and Lamictal will work well. Klonopin too, but there's a high risk for addiction (you're going to learn is a thing from peanut-eating future roommate.)\n\nNow, for some good news. The college you want to transfer to? You got in. You did pretty well for a while. You struggled to make friends at first. Not just cause you're... WE'RE... kinda weird, but you weren't rich like these kids were. Eventually you'll find your crew.

So, it&amp;#39;s been a while since I&amp;#39;ve made a post, but here&amp;#39;s an update. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I saw my doc about a month ago. I had been on the upswing for a while but still totally in control. I was deemed of such sound mind that my followup is 3 months from now, or 4 months in between instead of monthly. Awesome! I knew that&amp;#39;s how it was going to go, I had finally figured my brain out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Work was good but we were having a management change. And as I was the night manager it was my job to keep people motivated and to not quit as the new boss was more strict. She saw good qualities in me, as when I told her that I was looking for other work, 7 weeks to find someone to replace me, she came back to me the next day and said, &amp;quot;how much for you to stay?&amp;quot; I asked for an extra $3 per hour, putting me above even the store assistant managers. It&amp;#39;s legitimately how much I&amp;#39;d need to start paying down credit cards and get some money saved, and even be able to afford to eat. She said to give her 30 days for me to prove I&amp;#39;m worth 15. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this month I operated pretty much the same as I did prior, as I knew that my quality of work was above her standards, she just hadn&amp;#39;t seen it yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to last Sunday, I went in like any other day ready for an understaffed but really dead day. One of the guys who worked morning had made some extra chicken tenders so after about an hour into my shift I grabbed one and took it to the walk in to eat it. Once I was almost finished eating it I walked out and she walked right around the corner. This is a lady who won&amp;#39;t even answer her phone on the weekends and she showed up in the store. She saw me chewing and they fired me for theft and insubordination. On Monday I went back in to hand over my uniform and sign papers. Going back there is trespassing, whatever it wasn&amp;#39;t that good of a job anyway and their food is expensive as shit, hence me not paying for the chicken tender. They put insubordination on there because it was clearly stated that that was theft, so I was going against management and stealing. My bank account is minus 150 right now man, I&amp;#39;ll pay for food when I&amp;#39;ve paid for the roof over my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that didn&amp;#39;t phase me. I applied for lots of jobs over the following days, I started on Sunday. I got a call on Tuesday that they had sent out the wrong final check and the real one would be shipped today. Got the first final check yesterday. They gave me the 15 per hour. Or were going to, see they sent the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; check out. The real check will be here Monday instead. Yay late rent you fucks. I got the electronic pay stub for it, it&amp;#39;s for 12 still, so now other bills will just continue to get even later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding out I got the raise but got fired anyway was even tougher. I went and grabbed food from my parents and told them the situation. Got food and a gift card for the grocery store. Had a good time talking to them, still doing really well mentally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I had a date. I have not been on a date since I was 15. We had been talking for a couple of days before I asked her out, then I went and picked her up. I sang and we talked as we drove around, I was having fun but my good mood is hypomania, so there was an element of disjointedness to me. She literally asked me if I had done this before. Ouch, whatever soldier on. I tried to salvage as best I could but my haste and uncertainty put her on great edge. I have essentially no experience with one on one dates. She said I seemed uninterested. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Took her home after a bit of trying to find something to do in doors because it&amp;#39;s cold outside but most of the stuff is either expensive or just not for dating more for taking kids to. She isn&amp;#39;t 21 yet so no bars, I don&amp;#39;t even like alcohol it would just be more for a place to talk which wasn&amp;#39;t my house. Got her home. Waited a while after I got home and messaged her, she said I was too nice. Fucking hell. &amp;quot;you deserve better&amp;quot; etc. Ok got the hint and thanked her for the learning experience, she left it with &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t blame yourself.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not the end of the world, it&amp;#39;s one date that didn&amp;#39;t go as well as planned, I know how to keep myself happy and productive, don&amp;#39;t worry.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it did show me how woefully inadequate I am at the dating game, and that hurt more than all the other things combined. Gonna call the therapist and set up an appointment just to have someone to talk to about all of this because I don&amp;#39;t have anyone I can tell all this stuff to in person. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went through some of my old Facebook pics while we were out, they are very few and far between with most of them being older. She didn&amp;#39;t believe that I was who I said I was. All the pictures are me, I just change a lot. On my drivers license I weigh 180 pounds and am pretty depressed. In all my Facebook photos I&amp;#39;m the rail thin version of myself but there&amp;#39;s only one pic of me with facial hair up there, and she thought I had snagged pictures with a brother or something. Nope. They&amp;#39;re all me, there&amp;#39;s just a lot of time and a lot of mental changes in between all of those pictures. It was always me, I&amp;#39;m just constantly changing. So, being accused of lying wasn&amp;#39;t very fun either as I hate being called a liar. I hate when people lie to me, so I don&amp;#39;t lie to others. But whatever, she can think what she wants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just want some guidance on how you people who are successful at dating with this bs do it, because apparently I&amp;#39;m totally incapable still and I&amp;#39;m almost 22. I can&amp;#39;t attract a woman to save my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR when it rains it pours.

Recently graduated (one MSc and one MBA), working since then, almost a year. Imposter syndrome. Struggling with substance and alcohol abuse, among other things. Dealing with a 5 years-long relationship break-up from last january, still haven&amp;#39;t been able to move forward. Highly emotionaly dependent on others. Probably addictive personality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently dealing with crippling anxiety. To the point where it makes me unable to have a logical train-of-thought. Can&amp;#39;t focus at work, I barely do a single productive task per day. Can&amp;#39;t focus home either. I live alone. Basically, I lay on the floor dreading the next day to come. I started self-harming myself. Never done that before in my life. I stopped having any social activity. Can&amp;#39;t even function properly, or having a conversation when visiting my family on the week-end. Feeling guilty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, how to get out of this spiral-negative-thinking. I don&amp;#39;t have the willpower to take any action. I&amp;#39;m basically living one moment after another, expecting a dreadfull event to happen. And by living I mean : &amp;quot;the time goes by, I haven&amp;#39;t done a thing apart of my body doing what he does to live, breathing and stuff, and I&amp;#39;m still here&amp;quot;, kind of living. A bad let-it-go attitude. It&amp;#39;s killing me, not being able to have a positive, constructive mentality. I&amp;#39;m feeling lobotomized, failed, less-than-human, disabled.\nNothing seems to be able to drag me out of this state of mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m saying this here. Maybe a form of cathartic writing, or maybe there are other people that can relate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT : thank you everyone for your kind words. Somehow writing about it and reading relatable stories soothes me a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer some of the questions :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am under medication.

Recently graduated (one MSc and one MBA), working since then, almost a year. Imposter syndrome. Struggling with substance and alcohol abuse, among other things. Dealing with a 5 years-long relationship break-up from last january, still haven't been able to move forward. Highly emotionaly dependent on others. Probably addictive personality. \n\nCurrently dealing with crippling anxiety. To the point where it makes me unable to have a logical train-of-thought. Can't focus at work, I barely do a single productive task per day. Can't focus home either. I live alone. Basically, I lay on the floor dreading the next day to come. I started self-harming myself. Never done that before in my life. I stopped having any social activity. Can't even function properly, or having a conversation when visiting my family on the week-end. Feeling guilty.\n\nI don't know what to do, how to get out of this spiral-negative-thinking. I don't have the willpower to take any action. I'm basically living one moment after another, expecting a dreadfull event to happen. And by living I mean : \"the time goes by, I haven't done a thing apart of my body doing what he does to live, breathing and stuff, and I'm still here\", kind of living. A bad let-it-go attitude. It's killing me, not being able to have a positive, constructive mentality. I'm feeling lobotomized, failed, less-than-human, disabled.\nNothing seems to be able to drag me out of this state of mind. \n\nI don't know why I'm saying this here. Maybe a form of cathartic writing, or maybe there are other people that can relate.\n\n____________________________\n\nEDIT : thank you everyone for your kind words. Somehow writing about it and reading relatable stories soothes me a little bit.\n\nTo answer some of the questions :\n\nI am under medication. Lexapro and lamictal (but I don't take the lamictal as I would be supposed to). I also take xanax from time to time. I'm supposed to see a psychiatrist, but I didn't schedule an appointment since july. She still sends me the prescription, though.\n\n\nAnxious pretty much as long as I can remember.

I have very recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by my primary care physician. Some background on myself: I have struggled with mental illness for 7 years. I&amp;#39;ve always had extreme highs and lows, but was only told I might have depression, but was told my depression wasn&amp;#39;t severe. I have had 3 different suicide attempts, or at least I think so, I&amp;#39;m not sure if they count. Nobody, except for my PCP seems to know I have issues with mental health. I am very good at hiding my issues, so everyone assumes I&amp;#39;m fine, and even when I say I&amp;#39;m not, many think I am just being cynical. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have recently been prescribed Wellbutrin to help with the deep depression I&amp;#39;ve been in recently.

I have very recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by my primary care physician. Some background on myself: I have struggled with mental illness for 7 years. I've always had extreme highs and lows, but was only told I might have depression, but was told my depression wasn't severe. I have had 3 different suicide attempts, or at least I think so, I'm not sure if they count. Nobody, except for my PCP seems to know I have issues with mental health. I am very good at hiding my issues, so everyone assumes I'm fine, and even when I say I'm not, many think I am just being cynical. \n\nI have recently been prescribed Wellbutrin to help with the deep depression I've been in recently.

I know a lot of coping skills, I&amp;#39;ve been in crisis, I know I can survive and I can manage a lot of it  There are times when I still want to die because it&amp;#39;s so horrible, but I get through it. There&amp;#39;s a definite improvement since my 20s. I understand it more and I&amp;#39;m constantly learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However anxiety and CPTSD seem sort of like the final fronteir. My anxiety was never addressed, even though it was the source of much of my situational depression (not having friends as a kid, etc). I would get severely depressed because of the things I was unable to do. As my body has aged and I&amp;#39;m no longer a catch I don&amp;#39;t feel so in the spotlight and am often not noticed, there is no competition from others because I am irrelevant so that has lowered a lot of my anxiety to levels where I can do some things that I couldn&amp;#39;t do before. I tried karaoke a few years ago. I tried &amp;quot;public speaking&amp;quot; in front of a meetup group of socially anxious people, most of whom I knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t do these things before. When my anxiety was lowered just to the point where I could push through the fear it still wasn&amp;#39;t easy, it was extremely stressful, I was shaking from head to toe. The karaoke wasn&amp;#39;t fun because people left the room till I was done, so I didn&amp;#39;t do it again. The &amp;quot;public speaking&amp;quot; was a rush, I was so happy I did it at last! Bucketlist. I&amp;#39;m in my early 40s it really sucks that I missed out, you don&amp;#39;t get it back, you don&amp;#39;t get the same connection you would when you&amp;#39;re younger. It&amp;#39;s a consolation prize to do things when you&amp;#39;re older and a bit of a disappointment or letdown. It&amp;#39;s just at least not pressing on you anymore. You missed out already, too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically all the things that make people a little nervous or self conscious left me paralyzed with fear. As a result most of my life was wasted hiding out or lying in bed sleeping it away to get away from the pain. The while Just Do It now is often OK, before it was too severe and traumatizing. I don&amp;#39;t think people realized how bad it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CPTSD is something I don&amp;#39;t understand at all. I&amp;#39;m afraid of it. I was raised to produce factual defendable evidence, and CPTSD basically can&amp;#39;t count because it isn&amp;#39;t even in the DSM (at least wasn&amp;#39;t in IV, not sure about 5). So it&amp;#39;s kinda like a &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; illness, much like chronic fatigue. The people who have it know something is happening, there are people who clearly see something is going on, but there&amp;#39;s no scientific fact I can point out. PTSD is very clear and accepted, CPTSD is not. So I&amp;#39;ve ignored it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The therapy for CPTSD seems even worse. It&amp;#39;s like new agey stuff, like be gentle to yourself. That&amp;#39;s not going to fly in a world that says suck it up, life is hard, you&amp;#39;re being too oversensitive. With BPD I can see parallels and realistic connections, because linehan herself is very logical, she united intuitive murky things with logic which makes it easier for me to accept. I have evidence, I have a strong argument against naysayers, they have to listen to me and respect what is happening even if it is unfamiliar or unknown. If they don&amp;#39;t, well that&amp;#39;s their closeminded ignorance. People who don&amp;#39;t want to hear this are closed to many things, not just me. So it&amp;#39;s not about me. And that makes me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However I&amp;#39;m realizing that this fear/anxiety is still controlling my life and even exacerbating or triggering all my other symptoms and I realize if I want to get better I have to address it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if that all makes sense, it&amp;#39;s kinda rambly. But I&amp;#39;m having a hard time accepting these aspects of me, CPTSD and anxiety, I want to heal them so I can make my life better and more liveable, even to be able to have fun would be cool. I don&amp;#39;t often get to have fun, I feel like I&amp;#39;m always avoiding or grinding through. Fun isn&amp;#39;t permissible till I have accomplished enough.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What has helped you manage or overcome CPTSD? How do you do it? How has your life changed for the better?

I know a lot of coping skills, I've been in crisis, I know I can survive and I can manage a lot of it  There are times when I still want to die because it's so horrible, but I get through it. There's a definite improvement since my 20s. I understand it more and I'm constantly learning new things.\n\nHowever anxiety and CPTSD seem sort of like the final fronteir. My anxiety was never addressed, even though it was the source of much of my situational depression (not having friends as a kid, etc). I would get severely depressed because of the things I was unable to do. As my body has aged and I'm no longer a catch I don't feel so in the spotlight and am often not noticed, there is no competition from others because I am irrelevant so that has lowered a lot of my anxiety to levels where I can do some things that I couldn't do before.

I also know that volunteering again might be helpful, but mainly what I gleaned from that experience was that being a volunteer kind of sucked, whereas being a nurse or doctor was what I really wanted. \n\nAnyway, I'm going to post this on other forums, if I can find the right ones, but I thought I'd ask here and r/bipolar first.\n\nThanks!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "78atce", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "A Question For Medical Professionals With Bipolar (Specifically In USA)--I Want To Pursue A Career In The Medical Field, But I'm Having Trouble Figuring Out Exactly Which Position To Go After (x-post r/bipolar)", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "", "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_78atce", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/78atce/a_question_for_medical_professionals_with_bipolar/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508821165.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/78atce/a_question_for_medical_professionals_with_bipolar/", "author_flair_text": "longest depressive spell ever", "quarantine": false, "author": "cat-pants", "created_utc": 1508792365.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is really getting to me.

I was raised by a severely mentally ill mother, and emotionally distant AND temperamental/neglectful dad, who was close to my brothers and understood their needs but never fulfilled mine. My mom and dad divorced when I was little. I did not have a great childhood, as far as emotional support or stability. My mom left me and my brother alone, A LOT, to party/drink/date, there were weeks struggled to get out of bed just sitting in a dark room (not someone fit to raise kids at ALL.) The men she dated were abusive assholes to her and me and my brother (the cops even got involved once.) Her whole life was a drama that we were forced to live in. My dad ignored me. I&amp;#39;m not sure how to put it. He was neglected growing up by his dad, and his only way to show he cared was through money? Other than that my dad was constantly critical of me, telling me how horrible my mom is (the only woman figure in my life, being that my mom has no social skills and I&amp;#39;ll cover this later) and didn&amp;#39;t protect me from the abusive MEN my mom was dating. Even though my family knew what the fuck was going on. My dad isn&amp;#39;t super wealthy, but isn&amp;#39;t poor either. It was easy to sweep under the rug, for him, because he has a nice house, and a fancy car (an Audi, how could my life possibly be bad?) I would often complain to my counselor at school about the crap going on at home. Basically, I learned that no one could help me and I was stuck because my dad constantly reinforced the my negative and bad thoughts of myself. When I was six (I think?) my dad remarried. My step mom was just a mean jerk. Particularly to my brother, me and my mom (my younger brother is between my dad and her, so he&amp;#39;s my half brother.)

I was raised by a severely mentally ill mother, and emotionally distant AND temperamental/neglectful dad, who was close to my brothers and understood their needs but never fulfilled mine. My mom and dad divorced when I was little. I did not have a great childhood, as far as emotional support or stability. My mom left me and my brother alone, A LOT, to party/drink/date, there were weeks struggled to get out of bed just sitting in a dark room (not someone fit to raise kids at ALL.) The men she dated were abusive assholes to her and me and my brother (the cops even got involved once.) Her whole life was a drama that we were forced to live in. My dad ignored me. I'm not sure how to put it. He was neglected growing up by his dad, and his only way to show he cared was through money? Other than that my dad was constantly critical of me, telling me how horrible my mom is (the only woman figure in my life, being that my mom has no social skills and I'll cover this later) and didn't protect me from the abusive MEN my mom was dating. Even though my family knew what the fuck was going on. My dad isn't super wealthy, but isn't poor either. It was easy to sweep under the rug, for him, because he has a nice house, and a fancy car (an Audi, how could my life possibly be bad?) I would often complain to my counselor at school about the crap going on at home. Basically, I learned that no one could help me and I was stuck because my dad constantly reinforced the my negative and bad thoughts of myself. When I was six (I think?) my dad remarried. My step mom was just a mean jerk. Particularly to my brother, me and my mom (my younger brother is between my dad and her, so he's my half brother.) To sum it all up, my family is pretty sad, and none of us are that successful. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI feel like I've had to take care of my mom her whole life. I hate her.

He was abusive to me as a child and the only difference as an adult is he doesn&amp;#39;t hit me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I intentionally raised my kids away from him due to his violent temper and unpredictable nature. Even before my wife and I separated he had limited contact with my children, and always supervised with limited exceptions, usually emergencies where we needed help. He&amp;#39;s never done anything violent towards my kids, but my children are scared of him. My wife and I have been separated six months. About two months ago I told him he needed to back off he was scaring my kids, but he didn&amp;#39;t listen, so when my wife filed, part of her divorce was that our children not be allowed around my father, and as a consequence me until I no longer lived with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is constantly calling me names. Worthless, retarded, dumbass, fucking idiot, you name it I&amp;#39;ve probably been called it. He also threatens to throw me out of his house about once a month. By threaten I mean he grabs my shit and throws it outside then threatens to call the police if I don&amp;#39;t leave. Eventually he calms down, but it usually takes a few hours. I do have somewhere else I could live, but I&amp;#39;m in financial ruins and he has taken over paying lawyer&amp;#39;s fees, so I do need him. On top of that he&amp;#39;s involved in all my finances. He insisted on it, and because I&amp;#39;m scared of him I just did it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wants me to take a more active roll as I am a &amp;quot;worthless parent&amp;quot;. The problem is whenever I try to do anything he takes over. My kids are scared of him so they do whatever he says. Tonight for instance after he berated me for not taking an active enough roll and sending me to my &amp;quot;cave&amp;quot;, I told my kids I wanted them to come watch a movie in my room with me. I get very little time with them. He then decided to invite my daughter to watch a show with him. I came out of my room, said no, they are watching a show with me. I was pissed at him, but of course my daughter thought I was mad at her. I&amp;#39;ve tried to explain I wasn&amp;#39;t without saying your grandfather is a piece of shit and I&amp;#39;m angry with him because it&amp;#39;s just going to reinforce my wife&amp;#39;s lawyers stance. He then threatened me. &amp;quot;Shit is about to change when the kids are over here. Oh you&amp;#39;ll see.&amp;quot;, but of course he wouldn&amp;#39;t clarify what that meant. I tried to explain that when he is around his authority supersedes my own, but he wouldn&amp;#39;t even let me talk. All he said was &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m dangerous. Get the fuck out of here.&amp;quot;. I try to be an active dad, but he includes himself in everything whether he&amp;#39;s invited or not. He cooks all the meals because he&amp;#39;s afraid I&amp;#39;m going to burn the house down. I ran commercial kitchens for a decade. Like seriously, I know how to cook. I&amp;#39;m good too. When I correct my kids he tells me I&amp;#39;m yelling at them when I&amp;#39;m not, so they go home with stories of me yelling at them. I may raise my voice but I don&amp;#39;t yell. I&amp;#39;m not that kind of dad. I&amp;#39;m super laid back. When my kids screw up I prefer to have a conversation with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a mental health issue (bipolar) so he&amp;#39;s constantly questioning my judgement, or blaming my meds, or using my mental illness as a means of treating me like a child. I&amp;#39;ve successfully made middle class money for over a decade, and had three jobs in just as long, each change to improve the money I made. I didn&amp;#39;t want anything from him, I didn&amp;#39;t need anything from him, and our relationship improved. At least he didn&amp;#39;t call me names anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to be more active in my parenting, I would prefer he just stay out of it altogether, but he forces himself in, tells me I&amp;#39;m a shitty dad and how tired he is of dealing with my kids who come to him for everything because I have no authority to say yes or no in his home. If I do either and he disagrees with my decision, then he berates me in front of my kids the same way my wife used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to be their dad. He doesn&amp;#39;t allow me to make decisions, and every time I try to do something with them he steps in and they end up doing something with him instead. I can&amp;#39;t even talk to him about it because I&amp;#39;m always wrong. My therapist knows and she says it&amp;#39;s like living in a jail. When my kids aren&amp;#39;t around I sit in my room by myself watching Netflix waiting for my sleeping pill to kick in so I can say I survived one other day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to lose access to my children because of him. I know they are going to ask me about him in court and I&amp;#39;m going to tell the truth. That will get custody restricted, and me probably thrown out, but by that point I shouldn&amp;#39;t need any more of his money so I can move. I&amp;#39;m having to pay off the debt my ex acquired in my name and have about $2,000 left. I&amp;#39;ll need about $2,000 more to get setup in a new apartment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even your support structure can be terrible. I don&amp;#39;t complain to him about anything I&amp;#39;m going through because he just calls me names, or blames it on the bipolar, or the meds I take for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No real point to this post. Just needed to vent. It&amp;#39;s worse than what I&amp;#39;m saying, but that&amp;#39;s just what happened an hour ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "When my wife and I separated I had to move in with my Dad because I couldn't afford an attorney and a place to live.

When I correct my kids he tells me I'm yelling at them when I'm not, so they go home with stories of me yelling at them. I may raise my voice but I don't yell. I'm not that kind of dad. I'm super laid back. When my kids screw up I prefer to have a conversation with them.\n\nI have a mental health issue (bipolar) so he's constantly questioning my judgement, or blaming my meds, or using my mental illness as a means of treating me like a child. I've successfully made middle class money for over a decade, and had three jobs in just as long, each change to improve the money I made. I didn't want anything from him, I didn't need anything from him, and our relationship improved. At least he didn't call me names anymore.\n\nI want to be more active in my parenting, I would prefer he just stay out of it altogether, but he forces himself in, tells me I'm a shitty dad and how tired he is of dealing with my kids who come to him for everything because I have no authority to say yes or no in his home. If I do either and he disagrees with my decision, then he berates me in front of my kids the same way my wife used to.\n\nHe doesn't allow me to be their dad. He doesn't allow me to make decisions, and every time I try to do something with them he steps in and they end up doing something with him instead. I can't even talk to him about it because I'm always wrong. My therapist knows and she says it's like living in a jail. When my kids aren't around I sit in my room by myself watching Netflix waiting for my sleeping pill to kick in so I can say I survived one other day.\n\nI'm going to lose access to my children because of him. I know they are going to ask me about him in court and I'm going to tell the truth. That will get custody restricted, and me probably thrown out, but by that point I shouldn't need any more of his money so I can move. I'm having to pay off the debt my ex acquired in my name and have about $2,000 left. I'll need about $2,000 more to get setup in a new apartment. \n\nEven your support structure can be terrible. I don't complain to him about anything I'm going through because he just calls me names, or blames it on the bipolar, or the meds I take for it.\n\nNo real point to this post. Just needed to vent. It's worse than what I'm saying, but that's just what happened an hour ago.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "77y48x", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Issues with where I'm Staying getting taken out on on the Kids", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 13, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_77y48x", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/77y48x/issues_with_where_im_staying_getting_taken_out_on/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508673284.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/77y48x/issues_with_where_im_staying_getting_taken_out_on/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Sociofunetic", "created_utc": 1508644484.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel so unlovable as someone with Bipolar.

I really want to get off of it, though, but I'm dead-set on not taking APs because I'm terrified of the long-term side effects.\n\nAny suggestions/thoughts on using gabapentin for a long-term klonopin taper? Or experiences with gabapentin in general?\n\nThanks for any feedback!

My experience is colored by the fact that bipolar isn&amp;#39;t my only problem, but it did get me in a psych ward. Yay for that. (originally from my blog at charlieVweiss.kinja.com, if you want to read more of my stuff)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Accommodations Weren&amp;#39;t Enough&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s time to introduce you to the chaos that is my mere existence. Yes, folks, I\u2019m talking about my unbelievably awful medical history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, some background. Here are some things I have been diagnosed with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chronic psychophysiological insomnia\nTendonitis of the arms, wrists, hands, knees, and feet\nBursitis of the hips\nRaynaud\u2019s disease without gangrene\nChronic migraines\nAsthma\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\nMajor depressive disorder (with one episode)\nBipolar disorder (with major manic episode)\nAnd I like to add Fibromyalgia to the list, because a rheumatologist actually confirmed it, but didn\u2019t write down (which super screwed me over when I ended up in a psych ward). Here\u2019s what he said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSounds like you have chronic, unexplained pain in your whole body. Well, your test results are all clean, so some people might call that Fibromyalgia.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice the implication that he wouldn\u2019t call that Fibromyalgia, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My further evidence is this quote from an email I received from a Harvard clinical study on Fibro, which is currently the only way a broke ignorant college student can get access to innovative healthcare:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cFrom what you told me it seems like you will be a great candidate, I have had many other participants who don\u2019t have an actual diagnosis, so that will not exclude you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was good enough for me, especially considering this untestable, incurable disease is diagnosed entirely on self-reporting of pain. Which I definitely have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, I\u2019ve clearly got some major medical problems, but that list doesn\u2019t really tell you anything. Here are some of the everyday effects of all my illnesses:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Extreme fatigue (insomnia, fibromyalgia, migraines)\nDifficulty concentrating (insomnia, migraines)\nPain (all of the above)\nHopelessness and irritability (pain, depression, bipolar)\nNasty belly cramps (IBS, womanhood)\nShame (IBS, everything else)\nLight, sound, smell, taste, touch sensitivity (migraines, fibromyalgia)\nLoss of appetite (IBS, migraine, the physical act of eating hurts from fibromyalgia)\nBeing freezing all the time (Raynaud\u2019s, which means poor circulation)\nHot flashes (same thing, I can\u2019t regulate my temperature from Raynaud\u2019s)\nCrying (pain)\nExtremely painful muscle stiffness in the morning (fibromyalgia)\nLots and lots of other unpredictable problems\nInability to recover (insomnia, everything else)\nBasically, I wake up every morning feeling like I spent the night tied to active railroad tracks, and it only gets worse from there. And the best part is, it\u2019s pretty much all (currently) incurable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are some kinds of okay treatments for some of these things, but it\u2019s all in the works, and they\u2019re meant for people who only have one of these problems. For example, tylenol and NSAIDs can sometimes help my soft tissue pain, but it upsets my IBS which causes more pain, especially when combined with caffeine which I take for migraines, but that makes Raynaud\u2019s worse (and believe me, you probably underestimate how painful it is to not be a nice, neutral temperature), and that\u2019s all really stressful which makes my psychological things worse, which makes everything else worse, and whoopie now it\u2019s a downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don\u2019t forget! I was in college when I learned all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I\u2019d do something nice for myself, and secure some accommodations. What I didn\u2019t realize is that those are designed for people who have nice, manageable problems. They\u2019re meant to help you be more normal, by giving you slight advantages like being able to move to another room when your environment is too overwhelming, or get extra time on a test. It works alright at most schools, and if it doesn\u2019t, you can at least keep yourself under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I wanted something better for myself. I wanted something like me\u2014 unusual. Hard to believe. I wanted to go to a tiny, innovative engineering school called Olin College of Engineering, where everything is projects, and experiments, and teamwork, and fun. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And despite what happened next, that school is my heart. It\u2019s real small, and everyone (students, faculty, staff) is doing their damnedest to make it awesome. Everyone there works unbelievably hard, but sometimes, there\u2019s just too much work to do, and someone has to suffer for it. This time, that person was me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flexibility of experimental, team-based classes was both a blessing and a curse. It meant I could take days off when I needed to, and work when I wanted to, and it would usually be fine. But it also meant I was held far more accountable for my actions than most college students- my peers, friends, and professors were putting faith in me that I would abide by our Honor Code, and do the best I could, always. So, sure, the students (which used to include me) might have a hard time getting to class on time, or at all, but damn do they work hard to deliver on that promise. If you\u2019ve ever met an Oliner, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this school grants its students is this: Autonomy. From the school\u2019s perspective, this is because if you give people the resources, teach them the skills, and see what they want to accomplish, the results are astounding. I love how fantastic that is in its own right, but from my perspective, it\u2019s also the only way I can survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, my disabilities don\u2019t fit into pretty accommodating boxes. They\u2019re messy, overwhelming, interactive, and fluctuate constantly (often even in span of just a few minutes). You may have heard how hard it is for anyone with a disability to explain it to someone else, and it\u2019s about a million times harder for someone like me. It\u2019s almost impossible for me to understand and predict my body, much less explain it to someone else. It takes a huge toll on how I can interact with people, so I end up just pretending everything\u2019s fine because it\u2019s just way too tiring to bring another person to an accurate understanding. And I look fine, don\u2019t I?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when the disabilities counselor asked what accommodations I needed, I came up blank. It was just too hard to come up with an accurate prediction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I need to leave the room, or run around the room to get my circulation going, or disappear for a few days, or nap for 10 minutes, or blindfold myself, or change clothes, or eat, or go to the bathroom, or whatever, and there\u2019s a pretty solid chance I won\u2019t know until it\u2019s happening. Because, guys, I\u2019m in excruciating pain all the time\u2014 Pain isn\u2019t an indicator for me anymore. I have very little warning when my body needs something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, the whole point of accommodations is to help normalize me into the system. But I have never been, and never will be, normal. I wanted to be, but my body can\u2019t do it. I have to live a lifestyle that\u2019s very very different from the norm, because it\u2019s fixing problems that the norm has never even considered. And the really shitty part of that is, what\u2019s accommodating for me isn\u2019t always going to be accommodating for you, and there\u2019s a lot more of you. So when it comes down to it, I don\u2019t even really get a say in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, predictably I guess, the whole college thing failed miserably, because I fell into a downward spiral that I couldn\u2019t get out of, and my school understandably attributed it to mania rather than the hoard of other medical problems that I couldn\u2019t really explain, and I ended up in a psych ward. I had a bad time. I\u2019m writing a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how did I even make it through the first two years?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I\u2019m riddled with awful medical problems that make each other worse. Yeah, no one can help me. But I\u2019m a goddamn human being, so I adapt, and I figure out how to turn my problems into my strengths. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem: I can\u2019t work for two weeks, because my body is in excruciating pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: Use my tendency for mania from bipolar disorder to make up the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem: I\u2019m experiencing sensory overload from my environment, and I can\u2019t focus, and I\u2019m starting to panic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: Use my techniques to control my circulation to slow my heartbeat, which will help me be calm, and I can use my engineering skills to think of a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem: I\u2019m in way too much pain to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution: I will be in pain anyway (fibromyalgia). Do it anyway. I\u2019ve experienced enough pain so far that my pain tolerance is exceptional, if I can figure out how to focus (caffeine).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those are just some examples. After twenty years of living like this without perspective on what \u201cnormal\u201d is (because guess what runs in the family!), that\u2019s just what I learned to do. Figure out who or what I am, and make it work. I think that, at least, is pretty standard human experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that end, I\u2019ve found a way to change my story from \u201cdespite everything\u201d to \u201cbecause of everything,\u201d and even though I\u2019ve suffered more than any person should from merely existing, I intend to make good on my internal promise to make this worth it. I\u2019m going to make this world a place where someone like me can exist peacefully (and you\u2019ll probably all benefit in the process).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So good luck, my friends, and keep on chugging. If I can do it, you most certainly can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yours,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.

He&amp;#39;s an older man. There are good and bad. He&amp;#39;s not sure if I have bipolar with psychosis or schizoaffective right now, he wants to get to know me better. My therapist and family seem to think it&amp;#39;s schizoaffective because I&amp;#39;ve been hearing voices and have some paranoia, on medication, everyday, for 5 years now. I also had two psychotic episodes (not mood related) that were bad enough to make me hospital worthy or one actually put me in the hospital. He also told me bipolar people can have psychotic episodes without having a mood episode, which I thought wasn&amp;#39;t possible. But whatever. I want my symptoms treated. I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with a psychotic episode for maybe 4 months now. This is just background info.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good is I like he talks to you about things and doesn&amp;#39;t hide behind a computer and he writes notes in a file. He put me on buspair instead of shoving benzos down my throat for anxiety. He also put me on loxipine for my psychosis which has changed my life, with nearly no side effects. It took the edge off in a week, and by the end of two weeks I only experience psychotic symptoms related to stress. I call them &amp;#39;flairs&amp;#39; because I&amp;#39;ll only be psychotic for the rest of the day or for a few days after the stressful day or experience. But it&amp;#39;s serious enough to me that I feel concerned because I act on my delusion or paranoia during that time. I also hear voices more often during this time which is hard for me to tell it&amp;#39;s just a hallucination and nothing. Still despite the medicine I hear voices every day but the voices aren&amp;#39;t strong enough to compel me when I&amp;#39;m at my baseline. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So given that info here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m concerned about. First, he&amp;#39;s not happy I&amp;#39;m on an anti depressant (trintellix, so not an ssri) for depression. I&amp;#39;m at the highest dose of it and have been taking this medicine for a year, it&amp;#39;s never made me feel the least bit manic. He wants me to come off it because it&amp;#39;s not good for bipolar people, but he didn&amp;#39;t say why. But it&amp;#39;s controlling my depression so well, I don&amp;#39;t want to come off of it. I haven&amp;#39;t had a depressive episode for a long time or even a manic one for that manner. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it, brain wise, unhealthy for a bipolar person to be on an anti depressant even if it doesn&amp;#39;t make them manic and doesn&amp;#39;t have side effects. Is that what I&amp;#39;m missing here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told him, Thursday, about my current problem with psychosis but I felt like he didn&amp;#39;t take me seriously because he didn&amp;#39;t adjust the medication. Instead he told me I should learn to cope with it, and cope with stress so that I won&amp;#39;t experience stress therefore won&amp;#39;t experience psychosis. But everyone has stress, that seems like an unrealistic goal, especially given that I&amp;#39;m a grad student, I work as sub teacher and my grandmother just died. I&amp;#39;ve also been in therapy on and off for the last 5 years so it&amp;#39;s not like I don&amp;#39;t already cope. It&amp;#39;s also kind of hard to cope with these psychotic flairs because I don&amp;#39;t have insight into them during this time. I think everything is real or happening. I told him that but he still didn&amp;#39;t make a change. Then, he told me my goal for psychosis treatment should be to stop taking my anti psychotic regularly and only on days I feel bad. But that scares the shit out of me. (it takes a week for this medicine to have an affect on me even though he says it only takes a few days) I&amp;#39;ve tried very hard to get off anti psychotics in the past and it&amp;#39;s never worked, it&amp;#39;s always been really bad. My family agrees that I probably need a higher dose of the loxipine now instead of only taking it as needed. They&amp;#39;re the ones who have to be the voice of reason when I have these flairs. I also want to be functional all the time. I don&amp;#39;t want to have to take a day off because I&amp;#39;m having one of these &amp;#39;flairs&amp;#39; and I hate it when I&amp;#39;m working with children and I&amp;#39;m psychotic and don&amp;#39;t know it. Then when I do know it, I have to take days off. Right now I&amp;#39;m taking my anti psychotic everyday and will do so because I am still hearing voice. I actually woke up at 2 then couldn&amp;#39;t fall back asleep because of the voices talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This psychiatrist told me he takes a conservative approach to medication. I&amp;#39;m afraid he&amp;#39;s going to take away the stability I have now, if you can call that stability. I really don&amp;#39;t want to lower medicine, I don&amp;#39;t feel safe doing that. (unless there is some side effect to this stuff he&amp;#39;s not telling me). I really don&amp;#39;t want to go into a depression either. I feel like sometimes psychiatrist treat me like I&amp;#39;m stupid when really, I want to know everything about the medicine I&amp;#39;m taking and this disorder. This has made such an impact in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is, is this something off about him? He is older, been in the field for a long time, so he probably knows what he&amp;#39;s doing. He does a lot of work, he even teaches students. So should I trust his conservative approach? Or should I just bail and find a new psychiatrist? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I met him 2 months ago and he's very different compared to my other psychiatrist.

I exercise,meditate, journal and track my moods, and I&amp;#39;m willing to try other things to keep the symptoms in check. I was diagnosed at 17, I&amp;#39;m 34 now. I&amp;#39;ve been hospitalized several times each time starting a new set of meds that work for a while, then they stop working. I&amp;#39;ve been medicated this time for two years.\nThe current problem is with two medications in particular, Ambien ER, and clonazepam. Ever since my divorce started six months ago the Ambien has stopped working. I&amp;#39;ve told my doc this and there seems there&amp;#39;s nothing that can be done about it. The MAOI I&amp;#39;m on for depression and anxiety prevents me from taking anything else for sleep, so I&amp;#39;ve been taking two Ambien just to get some sleep. I still sleep on average 5-6 hours a night. I don&amp;#39;t feel groggy or medicated, but if I don&amp;#39;t take two I don&amp;#39;t sleep at all regardless of my cycle (which as stated I&amp;#39;ve been tracking). The second issue is with my clonzaepam. I&amp;#39;m on 2mg 3 times a day. I take it when I wake up, at lunch, and when I finish working about 4-4:30. I&amp;#39;ve tried playing with the times I take it to see what&amp;#39;s most effective (Doc approved). If I don&amp;#39;t take a fourth dose, which is not approved, before bed, I wake up having panic attacks. I&amp;#39;m also on propranolol for anxiety, but it only works in conjunction with the clonazapam. On it&amp;#39;s own it&amp;#39;s basically worthless. I&amp;#39;ve tried taking it when I wake up with panic attacks and it does nothing to alleviate the symptoms. Basically the only time it works is when I drink to much coffee (I drink one scoop a day at breakfast and I&amp;#39;m weening myself to nothing over time. This is a substantial drop from what i was drinking, about a pot a day, but the MAOI has interactions with it so I&amp;#39;ve cut down to bellow the recommended dose.). I&amp;#39;ve even stopped most stimulants to try and control this. I was a two pack a day smoker for twenty years. I&amp;#39;ve tried quitting cold turkey, but I always go back it,so this time I&amp;#39;m trying vaping. I started at a high dose of 36mg, but now I&amp;#39;m at 20mg. I&amp;#39;m weaning myself off over time. I&amp;#39;ve also quit dipping. My nicotine level is much lower than it used to be and I intend to take it even lower till I&amp;#39;m off it altogether. I&amp;#39;ve been off smokes for three months.\nI&amp;#39;m also on lithium ER which works great provided my dose isn&amp;#39;t messed with. I recently had oral surgery and had to take large amounts of ibuprofen which meant I had to lower my lithium (Doc approved), but there were complications from the surgery and I had to stay on a lowered dose of lithium for to long and it start producing side affects. Eventually my Doctor (who I stay in constant contact with) told me to go off the ibuprofen, insist the dentist give me low dose narcotics, and go back on the full dose of lithium. That&amp;#39;s a story in and of itself, but I won&amp;#39;t go into into that now. After three weeks on my full dose the issues with the lowered dose ended and I stopped experiencing issues (mainly suicidal tendencies).\nMy doc doesn&amp;#39;t like increasing my clonazapem, and only did it because last time i was in the hospital it was the only thing that proved effective. He also doesn&amp;#39;t like messing with my Ambien. Neither have really been explained. I know I&amp;#39;m at the max dose of both, but without an increase the symptoms are an issue. Like life affecting issues.\nI have an appointment with him this afternoon, and I&amp;#39;m wondering how I should bring this up, whether I should tell him I increased it on my own and found it effective, and I&amp;#39;m generally looking for any other options I can do to control my symptoms which are under control for the most part provided I take the unapproved doses. Aside from the bipolar I also have an anxiety disorder.\nAny thoughts or idea would be appreciated. I feel I should mention that I do not get high from the either meds. The clonazepam makes me a little tired, but bearable, and the ambien doesn&amp;#39;t produce any euphoria. Neither of them do, so this is not a an attempt to increase my doses so I can get high. There&amp;#39;s no point in lying about this on anonymous platform.\nI&amp;#39;m genuinely looking how to bring this up to my doc, what the repercussions are for increasing on my own, and if I should be doing anything else to keep the symptoms in check.\nThanks for any help you&amp;#39;re willing to provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm having some issues with my medications, and I'm doing some things I know I'm not supposed to do, but I'm at the point where I'm willing to do anything to seek relief.\nI should start by saying I am in counseling with a bipolar specialist.

If I don't take a fourth dose, which is not approved, before bed, I wake up having panic attacks. I'm also on propranolol for anxiety, but it only works in conjunction with the clonazapam. On it's own it's basically worthless. I've tried taking it when I wake up with panic attacks and it does nothing to alleviate the symptoms. Basically the only time it works is when I drink to much coffee (I drink one scoop a day at breakfast and I'm weening myself to nothing over time. This is a substantial drop from what i was drinking, about a pot a day, but the MAOI has interactions with it so I've cut down to bellow the recommended dose.). I've even stopped most stimulants to try and control this. I was a two pack a day smoker for twenty years. I've tried quitting cold turkey, but I always go back it,so this time I'm trying vaping. I started at a high dose of 36mg, but now I'm at 20mg. I'm weaning myself off over time. I've also quit dipping. My nicotine level is much lower than it used to be and I intend to take it even lower till I'm off it altogether. I've been off smokes for three months.\nI'm also on lithium ER which works great provided my dose isn't messed with. I recently had oral surgery and had to take large amounts of ibuprofen which meant I had to lower my lithium (Doc approved), but there were complications from the surgery and I had to stay on a lowered dose of lithium for to long and it start producing side affects. Eventually my Doctor (who I stay in constant contact with) told me to go off the ibuprofen, insist the dentist give me low dose narcotics, and go back on the full dose of lithium. That's a story in and of itself, but I won't go into into that now. After three weeks on my full dose the issues with the lowered dose ended and I stopped experiencing issues (mainly suicidal tendencies).\nMy doc doesn't like increasing my clonazapem, and only did it because last time i was in the hospital it was the only thing that proved effective. He also doesn't like messing with my Ambien. Neither have really been explained. I know I'm at the max dose of both, but without an increase the symptoms are an issue. Like life affecting issues.\nI have an appointment with him this afternoon, and I'm wondering how I should bring this up, whether I should tell him I increased it on my own and found it effective, and I'm generally looking for any other options I can do to control my symptoms which are under control for the most part provided I take the unapproved doses. Aside from the bipolar I also have an anxiety disorder.\nAny thoughts or idea would be appreciated. I feel I should mention that I do not get high from the either meds. The clonazepam makes me a little tired, but bearable, and the ambien doesn't produce any euphoria. Neither of them do, so this is not a an attempt to increase my doses so I can get high. There's no point in lying about this on anonymous platform.\nI'm genuinely looking how to bring this up to my doc, what the repercussions are for increasing on my own, and if I should be doing anything else to keep the symptoms in check.\nThanks for any help you're willing to provide.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "76xlw0", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Issues with Medication", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_76xlw0", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/76xlw0/issues_with_medication/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508264119.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/76xlw0/issues_with_medication/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Sociofunetic", "created_utc": 1508235319.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I was hospitalized.

Four months ago I got kicked out of my moms apartment and lost all my meds. \n\nSo I went cold turkey lost contact with my pdoc GP and case manager then two months ago I started to feel better? Wasn't feeling down felt like I could do anything so I enrolled in trucking school. 7k later I find out a diagnosed bipolar or schizophrenia makes you unqualified to hold a CDL A. So I hid it from my employer. My concern now is what if I've been hypomanic this whole time. I get disability hence I have a cell phone. The voice are more pronounced the more I think about it.

But, I really would like some advice... (I am a 27 y/o guy, she&amp;#39;s a 25 y/o girl).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, recently I met a person online and we hit it off great. She is incredible, beautiful, funny. Literally everything I have ever wanted in a relationship. We started talking, had instant chemistry, and that was it, I&amp;#39;m falling for her and she me. We live about 5 hours apart, but despite the distance, we&amp;#39;re both committed to making this work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very early on in our conversations, she was open with me about her mental health, specifically being bipolar. I appreciated her honesty and openness about it, and told her I&amp;#39;d support her however I could, but that I&amp;#39;m unfamiliar with what real bipolar is rather than just society&amp;#39;s label of it as being &amp;quot;mood swings&amp;quot;. She talked to me about her past, suicidal thoughts, mania, disassociation, and other terms that I can&amp;#39;t really remember. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For weeks everything had been absolutely perfect; talking on the phone every day, getting to know each other, being open and honest about our feelings. It&amp;#39;s been wonderful. But, a few weeks ago, something changed. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to call it...it&amp;#39;s not really an &amp;quot;episode&amp;quot; but it has occurred multiple times since and it&amp;#39;s somewhat of a pattern (again, I&amp;#39;m not familiar with any terms really). All of a sudden one day, she shut me out. Said she didn&amp;#39;t want anything to do with me, that I was better off moving on, done.

I find myself in these situations doing everything possible to pull her back to me and talk to me, including blaming myself for things that I (knowingly) didn&amp;#39;t really do or apologizing profusely. Sometimes, my rambling about random conversations can eventually calm her down and start communicating again. I know that this is part of her bipolar disorder, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to navigate it. I&amp;#39;m also trying really hard to not let my own emotions dictate these situations, since I know that she can&amp;#39;t help her reactions. But, sometimes I get frustrated that she&amp;#39;s shutting me down or exasperated that I can&amp;#39;t do anything, especially over the phone. I&amp;#39;m worried that her mental health will overwhelm my own,  since I never know what to say to make it better and not worse. I get a lot of &amp;quot;you do what you want to do&amp;quot; responses rather than her telling me what she wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what are some things that I can do in these circumstances to help? Given that we&amp;#39;re long distance, I&amp;#39;m worried that if I were to just stop messaging her and give her space during these times to calm down, that it&amp;#39;ll develop into her thinking I don&amp;#39;t want to be with her at all and cutting me off. I want to make this work so badly, but I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s appropriate to say or do when this is happening. I would like to bring up therapy or medication, but I don&amp;#39;t want to offend her or something. She&amp;#39;s told me that she&amp;#39;s tried several types of medications, but most have led her to becoming more suicidal, and the one or two that sort of worked, she can&amp;#39;t afford in her state. These &amp;quot;episodes&amp;quot; occur roughly once a week, and I recognize them as being her bipolar state trying to self sabotage, but I want to make this better. I don&amp;#39;t want this cycle to be our new &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; if we can prevent. I want to learn what&amp;#39;s the best way to talk to someone while they&amp;#39;re in this state without saying something that can be misconstrued or interpreted.

First off, I want to say that I am very new to bipolar and am unfamiliar with a lot of the terms, so I apologize if this is confusing or if I'm not saying something the right way. But, I really would like some advice... (I am a 27 y/o guy, she's a 25 y/o girl).\n\nSo, recently I met a person online and we hit it off great. She is incredible, beautiful, funny. Literally everything I have ever wanted in a relationship. We started talking, had instant chemistry, and that was it, I'm falling for her and she me. We live about 5 hours apart, but despite the distance, we're both committed to making this work.\n\nVery early on in our conversations, she was open with me about her mental health, specifically being bipolar. I appreciated her honesty and openness about it, and told her I'd support her however I could, but that I'm unfamiliar with what real bipolar is rather than just society's label of it as being \"mood swings\".

First of all, we both have mental issues and though I&amp;#39;m going to therapy and getting treatment, I still struggle with intense irritability issues and bouts of depression, anger, etc. My wife refuses to get any treatment for anxiety/depression because she &amp;quot;feels really anxious about going to the doctor.&amp;quot; So nothing really changes. It feels like I&amp;#39;m stuck in an endless cycle that I have no idea how to break. My wife and I habitually take our negative emotions out on each other.

My wife struggles with anxiety and depression and it&amp;#39;s as if we both are so preoccupied with our own personal issues that we are hardly ever present and involved with each other the way that I would like to be. We are both extremely distracted by how unhappy/stressed/irritated/anxious we feel pretty much all the time. I desperately want to fix this, but I don&amp;#39;t know how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get really frustrated by how I feel. I spend most of my days feeling angry at myself or guilty for not being more positive and a better husband. I think one of my biggest problems is that I&amp;#39;m so beyond unhappy with my job and the grind of life in general just really brings me down. My wife has told me that she feels similar about her job. We find very little solace or respite in each other because of how negative we both feel. It&amp;#39;s complicated, but essentially any negative emotion I express, my wife takes personally and it creates this huge wall between us. I guess you could say I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I don&amp;#39;t really know how not to show my emotions. I&amp;#39;m very bad at repressing emotions or controlling them. Aside from taking medicine that just kind of makes me stop feeling stuff so much. It&amp;#39;s like I know exactly what the problem is, I just don&amp;#39;t know how to fix it. I don&amp;#39;t know how to be more positive. I get so irrationally angry or sad and I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle it except to tell myself I&amp;#39;m just being &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; and that the extreme emotion will eventually calm down. I used to smoke cigarettes to help me calm down whenever I felt anxious or angry, but I quit and I don&amp;#39;t have any other way I know of to cope with those feelings. I don&amp;#39;t want to have outbursts or lash out at people but it&amp;#39;s just hard for me to deal with. My way of dealing with things is to just get them out as soon as possible. But when I talk about things to my wife, it just brings her down and she seems to want to blame herself for me feeling bad. I try to assure her nothing is her fault and I&amp;#39;m just needing to vent, but I&amp;#39;ve come to find it&amp;#39;s never really a good idea to try to talk to her about anything. When I go to therapy, it helps me but I feel like it&amp;#39;s just an hour of me venting and the therapist giving me some very general advice. I self analyze after leaving therapy and usually feel stupid and embarrassed about everything I talked about in therapy. Like how inconsequential and stupid the things that bother me really are in the grand scheme of things. My therapist says it&amp;#39;s good that I am self aware and can recognize when I&amp;#39;m being irrational. The issue is I&amp;#39;m always irrational. I&amp;#39;m always overly emotional. Part of me resents the notion that I have to change for other people and pretend that things don&amp;#39;t bother me just to fit into society and sell this illusion that nothing bothers me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know what I&amp;#39;m looking for other than to just vent. Sometimes that&amp;#39;s really all I can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s difficult for me is that no one ever seems to understand or care what I&amp;#39;m going through. Everyone seems to think that I&amp;#39;m an asshole and just antisocial or mean. I hate that this is how people perceive me. I tend to inadvertently push people and I wish that I didn&amp;#39;t. I hate feeling misunderstood and I wish that I could get along with people, have stronger relationships with my friends, and have a healthier relationship with my wife. But I&amp;#39;m just really really bad at being a decent person sometimes. There are times when my wife is just astonished and confused by how I act. She will make comments like &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a crazy person&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;You are insane.&amp;quot; And it&amp;#39;s like I know that, but it really kind of hurts to hear someone say so. Sometimes I blame myself a lot for everything and it&amp;#39;s messed up but I don&amp;#39;t know if I deserve the blame or not. Maybe I&amp;#39;m in an abusive relationship and if I got out of it, I would be healthier.

He said I\u2019m mean to him but he is just as mean back. \n\nIf I was having an episode I didn\u2019t realize it so if he read the book I got him he could have responded in a way that de escalated the situation instead of escalating it. He didn\u2019t read the book and lost it. \n\nToday I start an intense week at work where I\u2019m monitoring some very important testing. I don\u2019t know the tool well so it takes me some time to get the data. Not to mention I\u2019m behind in paying bills and behind on my job Work not to mention our filthy house. \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep last night. I feel like I\u2019m going to get a divorce and lose custody of my son. I am having a hard time going on.

In April I was sent to the psych ward for being severally depressed and suicidal, while there they misdiagnosed me with mdd (major depressive disorder).

So after I moved in the celexca withdrawals started to occur.  The symptoms I was having had no connection with what I was reading online so I assumed I was fine.   After 3 days in college I had my first major manic episode.  I decided to start selling drugs (I&amp;#39;ve never sold in my life).  I was having alot of sex with girls met that day/night.

In April I was sent to the psych ward for being severally depressed and suicidal, while there they misdiagnosed me with mdd (major depressive disorder).  Even after 3-4 days from being there I was feeling happy and excitable which should've raised a major flag but it was never noticed.\n\nFast forward to the end of august and about 5 days before I moved into dorms I decided to go off my meds which was a mistake in its self but I just wanted to be a better person again.  So after I moved in the celexca withdrawals started to occur.  The symptoms I was having had no connection with what I was reading online so I assumed I was fine.   After 3 days in college I had my first major manic episode.  I decided to start selling drugs (I've never sold in my life).  I was having alot of sex with girls met that day/night.

It&amp;#39;s horrible. I wish I could go on a tirade about it, because it really is that bad, but suffice it to say, the job is very hard on me. I didn&amp;#39;t realize it would be - otherwise I would&amp;#39;ve never taken it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have BP1 with mixed episodes. I&amp;#39;m also bulimic.

I know patterns in myself, I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with BP for almost a decade, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that if I start binging and purging multiple times a day, and launching into uncontrollable rages over nothing, a serious episode is coming on.

My husband now leaves the building immediately if I so much as sneeze too loudly. I hate myself for what I do to him, I tell myself every time I will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; let my moods get the best of me, that I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; control them, but they\u2019re only getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cope using bulimia. As my mood gets worse, so do my eating habits. Yesterday I vomited some blood, it wasn&amp;#39;t a lot, but I began to have pretty intense pains in my upper-right abdomen, almost as if I pulled a muscle. My husband told me to go to the doctor but I&amp;#39;ve been there enough to know they won&amp;#39;t help. Today, during another purge, I upchucked (to my great surprise) the lunch I&amp;#39;d eaten 7 hours beforehand, it hadn&amp;#39;t left my stomach at all or gone through digestion, there wasn&amp;#39;t any acid or bile. And that&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strange to me, in all my years of eating things and puking them back up, that&amp;#39;s never happened.

But I'm not going to panic cos I have the best team around me - professionals, family, friends.\n\n\nThe last few episodes of hypomania I have experienced were mostly volatile and extremely painful, although during this episode I felt like I was on crack (kidding) and felt great. Having some insight about it is both a good and bad thing - you can recognise the shit that's going on but sometimes you just can't think your way out of it (especially for me this time as I was going higher than I ever did before).\n\n\nHypomania ending is like walking past somebody with the most fragrant, attractive and alluring perfume/cologne but not having them come back to you. It's like euthymia has been kissed and stroked on the cheek by such person, and you know they're not coming back. It's like driving down a highway and losing them in your rearview..  it's a bittersweet thing.\n\n\nNow I'm not sure if I ever want to welcome that presence in my life again.

I have a family history (mom and her brother) of bipolar disorder. I have been seen by my base\u2019s mental health clinic and a psychiatrist who told me that I have \u201cmild depression at best\u201d and that my symptoms &amp;quot;do not meet his criteria&amp;quot; for a bipolar diagnosis. He and my therapist had me do a bunch of psych testing and at my two-week follow up appointment after the testing, the only thing that had been determined was that I had a major depressive episode over this summer, which I had already determined on my own.

But then night came and the voices started. They always start at night. They say I&amp;#39;m not good enough and that no one cares about me. They won&amp;#39;t stop and then I can&amp;#39;t sleep. I usually get up and leave because I think that if I&amp;#39;m away from my home, they will go away and it allows me to suffer by myself. My caregiver usually lets me leave and that makes it worse. I start believing that no one cares about me and that I&amp;#39;m on my own. I cry and drive around the city for a while before finding somewhere to park. I try to make everything stop but it never does. Then comes the thoughts that I need to just end it because things won&amp;#39;t ever get better. I get scared because I don&amp;#39;t actually WANT to die. I then try to go back home and get reassurance from my caregiver but I end up feeling stupid and worse. They talk to me as though I&amp;#39;m a crazy child. After crying for hours, the voices finally get quieter and I can fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so afraid for myself. I really think that one day I&amp;#39;m going to hurt myself or crash into someone while I&amp;#39;m driving around and hurt them. Is this even Bipolar Disorder? I feel completely fine until something triggers bad thoughts and then the voices take over. It&amp;#39;s almost always at night when I&amp;#39;m laying down that they get loud. I&amp;#39;ve talked to my psychiatrist about this but it feels like she&amp;#39;s not giving me any ways to stop this.

I had actually been diagnosed by two doctors before accepting that something was wrong.\n\nSince then, I've tried different medications. I posted a week ago that Zyprexa was helping. I was embarrassed to take the medication but I noticed a difference when I did take it. I guess I spoke too soon because last night my cycle of craziness started all over again. \n\nIt always starts when if I'm tired or stressed. I've been extremely stressed for the past few weeks because I'm being laid off from my job. I keep freaking out about how I'll be able to pay for therapy because I would only get a month of severance and unemployment would just cover my bills. \n\nYesterday the breaking point was seeing that another one of my exes has gotten engaged.

Regardless it caused half of my family including mg father to disown me (he is my only parent, mom is deceased). \n\nI started sleeping with a man I certainly should not be sleeping with and it bothers me on some level, but I don't want to stop because I want sex so much.\n\nI spend money on the lottery and clothes- got a rasie and somehow managed to spend 1,000 in just a week. That's a lot for me.\n\nMy mood however is nuts. I am at times insanely happy and talkative. I can't sit still at my desk and doing work seems boring and I don't want to do it so I don't. It is the same way with my school work and that isn't like me. \n\nMost days I am blissful and then something happens and I either get really mad or sad. The suicidal thoughts have started again about two weeks ago (they had been completely gone for months). \n\nI feel like I am going crazy and I can't stop. Like a car going 100mph with no brakes. \n\nI got into trouble today for making a sexual innuendo at work that I normally would have never made as we are a professional organization. A part of me cares, a part of me doesn't. \n\nI am seeing my doctor next week. Am I having a problem on this medicine or is being happy and excited all the time normal while my bad decisions are just bad decisions? Am I over thinking this?

Last weekend I happened to notice I was feeling really good, higher than usual. Previously I suspected I could be bipolar, but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure because I didn&amp;#39;t realize any hypomanic type phases. But last weekend it was like night and day. I was sure. I spent all weekend trying to figure it out and started realizing other times I felt this way. Apparently you don&amp;#39;t always know when you&amp;#39;re hypo, so that makes sense I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m having a great weekend, and once I had mostly come down so to speak, on Monday I think it was, I went in to try to get a psychiatrist. I was told they only offer group therapy, due to budget cuts and that I seemed in too good a state for me to really need to be there. I&amp;#39;m not a group person, so I denied that. They referred me to a family therapist at my clinic for an appointment late next month. I decided to email her and ask if she&amp;#39;s the right type of therapist to help me figure this out, she told me she could make a diagnosis, but it would be better for me to see a psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I asked my primary if we had any psychiatrists in town, and she told me we don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;d need to drive 100 miles to a larger town. I&amp;#39;m been having car problems lately so I was not happy about this. By then it was Wednesday and I was feeling less great by each day, and hearing this really got me down a level. Luckily I did have plans to get together with some friends (who happen to be bipolar). We had a nice time, but they mentioned sexual assault and were talking about that a bit, and I got to thinking..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually went home as I have to get up early for work the next morning. And as I&amp;#39;m laying in bed trying to fall asleep, I start to think about my various past sexual experiences and if any of those had been assault.\nI started looking up sexual assault and it&amp;#39;s basically just when you haven&amp;#39;t given someone consent. I had an experience last year where I was alone, working, at night, in a liquor store and a drunk customer was giving me grief. He wanted to kiss me, on the lips no less, and I wasn&amp;#39;t okay with that, I told him no but he wouldn&amp;#39;t take it, and he came in at me and kissed me. I felt frozen, like I couldn&amp;#39;t stop him and I had no one around to help, so I let it happen. Eventually he left. I never told anyone because I thought it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad. It&amp;#39;s just a kiss. What&amp;#39;s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as I was saying, here I am Wednesday night, looking back on this and realizing that is sexual assault. And that was such a terrible feeling to look at it in that way. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it. I went out into the living room to tell my boyfriend, that he made me feel like I was in the wrong and how I felt during the experience, and that I now see it for what it was. I did some crying, he consoled me, all better right? No. I went back into my room, laid down and proceeded to ugly cry. When I ugly cry, I tend to end up relieving it with cutting. So I did that and felt a little better, but I was still in that well of despair and I knew I shouldn&amp;#39;t be alone in my room, with sharp objects. So I got some clothes on and got my shoes on (as my boyfriend looks at me worried, I kissed him and told him to leave the door unlocked) and I left, taking nothing with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up going out without a purpose or direction in mind specifically, but subconsciously (and because I don&amp;#39;t go for walks without a destination), I was headed back to my friend&amp;#39;s place. This took maybe 1.5 hours and by that time, no one was awake. At this point it was pretty late, I was very tired and would need to be up for work in about 2 hours, maybe 3 if i stretched it. I don&amp;#39;t function well with less than 4 or 5, so I probably wasn&amp;#39;t planning on going to work the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood at my friend place for a few, then decided to start the trek back home. I was hoping I&amp;#39;d either be picked up by the police and they could help me or I&amp;#39;d die. I decided to take the route home that has the train tracks and as I was at those tracks, I spend a minute or so, standing there, thinking that if a train came, I could just let it all go, but I continued walking. As I was going around the bend and was on higher ground than the tacks, the crossing signs went down, the lights came on, and I heard the train coming. I really did consider going back down there. I had the time, I could have, and I&amp;#39;m a very impulsive person... but I didn&amp;#39;t I continued walking, watched the train pass, decided it didn&amp;#39;t seem like it was going very fast and wondered how fast it was going and if it could have ended me. I continued walking, got home, tried to eat something, and crashed. By then it had been about 3 hours since I had left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up an hour or two later when my boyfriend kissed me on my forehead and said goodbye. I moved into the bedroom and slept maybe an hour or two more at most. When I woke up again I still wasn&amp;#39;t feeling ready to get out of bed, so I was talking to my friends I was with the night before and told them what happened. They strongly suggested I tell my doctor. So I sent my doctor an email and at this time my phone was on silent. I was going to try to get back to sleep. Apparently she emailed me back 20 min later, I didn&amp;#39;t answer. She called, I didn&amp;#39;t answer. And the next thing I know, there were police at my door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was completely out of it and complied with all their orders. They took me to the place where I was previously on Monday. I talked to the same lady I talked to on Monday and she noticed a distinct difference in how I was acting. She asked me if I wanted to be taken to the state hospital or the CRU (apparently I picked wrong). I decided to go to the state hospital. An officer took me over, I was admitted and held for approx 26 hours. During that time, I mostly slept, specially the first day. During that first day I saw a psychiatrist and after talking with me and assessing me, he neither gave me a diagnosis or any medication. He said he is generally against medication. He tried to suggest I should be eating organic, drinking spring water and practicing mindfulness and other techniques. He also tried to get me to believe suicide is not the answer and told me to watch videos on youtube about people coming back from suicide and seeing the light. (I&amp;#39;m atheist if that matters).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was upset with the way he handled it all and I&amp;#39;ll admit, my motto is &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll survive&amp;quot; as in I&amp;#39;ve been through a lot of tough times in my life and I&amp;#39;ve made attempts before, and I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for far longer than the attempts I&amp;#39;ve made, so yes, I am powering through, I&amp;#39;m a survivor, it&amp;#39;s what I do.... BUT&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m impulsive and do having feelings of depression and wanting to hurt myself. When I mention depression, he tells me it&amp;#39;s all in my head and it&amp;#39;s no excuse and I can overcome it. But like I said, I cooperated. He said he wanted to release me that night... maybe 8-10 hours I had been there... but he usually doesn&amp;#39;t do that and didn&amp;#39;t want to risk anything, so he said he&amp;#39;d release me the next morning, if I signed a voluntary admission form. So I did and was released at 1pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get home and was finally able to talk to my boyfriend (his phone hasn&amp;#39;t had service recently) and I find out he looked for me. He went to the regular hospital, then the state hospital (he knew I was at a hospital), and the state hospital has a lot of buildings, so he&amp;#39;s checking all these buildings, no one seems to be helping him find me. He finally checks the building I&amp;#39;m in.. and the lady flips through a book monetarily, says she can&amp;#39;t give out information, so he leaves. This pisses me off because I specifically added him to my shared information list. This does not give me a good vibe of the state hospital at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I left, they made sure I had an appointment for a therapist, which is the appointment I previously made for next month. So now I&amp;#39;m home, I&amp;#39;m safe, I&amp;#39;m with my friend (and getting together with another friend as well tomorrow). I have a good support network and I think I&amp;#39;ll get through this.

Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've been having recurring depression that lasts for a couple weeks, then goes away for a bit, then comes back. Last weekend I happened to notice I was feeling really good, higher than usual. Previously I suspected I could be bipolar, but I wasn't sure because I didn't realize any hypomanic type phases. But last weekend it was like night and day. I was sure. I spent all weekend trying to figure it out and started realizing other times I felt this way. Apparently you don't always know when you're hypo, so that makes sense I guess.\n\nSo I'm having a great weekend, and once I had mostly come down so to speak, on Monday I think it was, I went in to try to get a psychiatrist. I was told they only offer group therapy, due to budget cuts and that I seemed in too good a state for me to really need to be there. I'm not a group person, so I denied that. They referred me to a family therapist at my clinic for an appointment late next month. I decided to email her and ask if she's the right type of therapist to help me figure this out, she told me she could make a diagnosis, but it would be better for me to see a psychiatrist.\n\nSo I asked my primary if we had any psychiatrists in town, and she told me we don't. I'd need to drive 100 miles to a larger town. I'm been having car problems lately so I was not happy about this. By then it was Wednesday and I was feeling less great by each day, and hearing this really got me down a level. Luckily I did have plans to get together with some friends (who happen to be bipolar). We had a nice time, but they mentioned sexual assault and were talking about that a bit, and I got to thinking..\n\nI eventually went home as I have to get up early for work the next morning. And as I'm laying in bed trying to fall asleep, I start to think about my various past sexual experiences and if any of those had been assault.\nI started looking up sexual assault and it's basically just when you haven't given someone consent. I had an experience last year where I was alone, working, at night, in a liquor store and a drunk customer was giving me grief. He wanted to kiss me, on the lips no less, and I wasn't okay with that, I told him no but he wouldn't take it, and he came in at me and kissed me. I felt frozen, like I couldn't stop him and I had no one around to help, so I let it happen. Eventually he left. I never told anyone because I thought it wasn't that bad. It's just a kiss. What's the big deal?\n\nSo as I was saying, here I am Wednesday night, looking back on this and realizing that is sexual assault. And that was such a terrible feeling to look at it in that way. I couldn't handle it. I went out into the living room to tell my boyfriend, that he made me feel like I was in the wrong and how I felt during the experience, and that I now see it for what it was. I did some crying, he consoled me, all better right? No. I went back into my room, laid down and proceeded to ugly cry. When I ugly cry, I tend to end up relieving it with cutting. So I did that and felt a little better, but I was still in that well of despair and I knew I shouldn't be alone in my room, with sharp objects. So I got some clothes on and got my shoes on (as my boyfriend looks at me worried, I kissed him and told him to leave the door unlocked) and I left, taking nothing with me.\n\nI ended up going out without a purpose or direction in mind specifically, but subconsciously (and because I don't go for walks without a destination), I was headed back to my friend's place. This took maybe 1.5 hours and by that time, no one was awake. At this point it was pretty late, I was very tired and would need to be up for work in about 2 hours, maybe 3 if i stretched it. I don't function well with less than 4 or 5, so I probably wasn't planning on going to work the next morning.\n\nI stood at my friend place for a few, then decided to start the trek back home. I was hoping I'd either be picked up by the police and they could help me or I'd die. I decided to take the route home that has the train tracks and as I was at those tracks, I spend a minute or so, standing there, thinking that if a train came, I could just let it all go, but I continued walking. As I was going around the bend and was on higher ground than the tacks, the crossing signs went down, the lights came on, and I heard the train coming. I really did consider going back down there. I had the time, I could have, and I'm a very impulsive person... but I didn't I continued walking, watched the train pass, decided it didn't seem like it was going very fast and wondered how fast it was going and if it could have ended me. I continued walking, got home, tried to eat something, and crashed. By then it had been about 3 hours since I had left.\n\nI woke up an hour or two later when my boyfriend kissed me on my forehead and said goodbye. I moved into the bedroom and slept maybe an hour or two more at most. When I woke up again I still wasn't feeling ready to get out of bed, so I was talking to my friends I was with the night before and told them what happened. They strongly suggested I tell my doctor. So I sent my doctor an email and at this time my phone was on silent. I was going to try to get back to sleep. Apparently she emailed me back 20 min later, I didn't answer. She called, I didn't answer. And the next thing I know, there were police at my door.\n\nI was completely out of it and complied with all their orders. They took me to the place where I was previously on Monday. I talked to the same lady I talked to on Monday and she noticed a distinct difference in how I was acting. She asked me if I wanted to be taken to the state hospital or the CRU (apparently I picked wrong). I decided to go to the state hospital. An officer took me over, I was admitted and held for approx 26 hours. During that time, I mostly slept, specially the first day. During that first day I saw a psychiatrist and after talking with me and assessing me, he neither gave me a diagnosis or any medication. He said he is generally against medication. He tried to suggest I should be eating organic, drinking spring water and practicing mindfulness and other techniques. He also tried to get me to believe suicide is not the answer and told me to watch videos on youtube about people coming back from suicide and seeing the light. (I'm atheist if that matters).\n\nI was upset with the way he handled it all and I'll admit, my motto is \"I'll survive\" as in I've been through a lot of tough times in my life and I've made attempts before, and I've been depressed for far longer than the attempts I've made, so yes, I am powering through, I'm a survivor, it's what I do.... BUT\n\nI'm impulsive and do having feelings of depression and wanting to hurt myself. When I mention depression, he tells me it's all in my head and it's no excuse and I can overcome it. But like I said, I cooperated. He said he wanted to release me that night... maybe 8-10 hours I had been there... but he usually doesn't do that and didn't want to risk anything, so he said he'd release me the next morning, if I signed a voluntary admission form. So I did and was released at 1pm.\n\nI get home and was finally able to talk to my boyfriend (his phone hasn't had service recently) and I find out he looked for me. He went to the regular hospital, then the state hospital (he knew I was at a hospital), and the state hospital has a lot of buildings, so he's checking all these buildings, no one seems to be helping him find me. He finally checks the building I'm in.. and the lady flips through a book monetarily, says she can't give out information, so he leaves. This pisses me off because I specifically added him to my shared information list. This does not give me a good vibe of the state hospital at all.\n\nBefore I left, they made sure I had an appointment for a therapist, which is the appointment I previously made for next month. So now I'm home, I'm safe, I'm with my friend (and getting together with another friend as well tomorrow). I have a good support network and I think I'll get through this. I talked to my mom tonight and she doesn't believe I'm bipolar of course, but I understand that's normal of mothers.\n\nNow I'm just waiting for this appointment, to try to figure out why I'm feeling this way, what if anything is making me feel this way and how to solve it. I'm not really looking for anything specific from any of you. I'm just venting and want to maybe get some perspectives from any of you. Obviously a diagnosis will be handled by my therapist, but until then, I could use some support.

Long story short, I didnt know he was playing me, I didnt want to be around his wife, so he told me to have a nice future. He then told everyone we know that I'm bipolar so I freaked out about the adoption and that's why I'm not around. It's been a few weeks, but it's destroying me.\n\nI'm not close with my best friends anymore, they decided that they couldn't handle me. \n\nMy boyfriend works 24 hour shifts and is working overtime and was on a trip so I haven't seen him in 5 days, he usually helps when I get like this.\n\nMy anxiety is so high that it feels like someone is sitting on my chest. I cant breathe. I feel so empty and numb but so anxious at the same time.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "73k85n", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Falling apart", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzru", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_73k85n", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/BipolarReddit/comments/73k85n/falling_apart/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1506868924.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/73k85n/falling_apart/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "girlski", "created_utc": 1506840124.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BipolarReddit", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.BipolarReddit", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t orgasm on it.

I've taken lexapro, effexor, zoloft, and prozac (which I'm currently taking @ 60mg). I know I took something else, but I cannot remember which one lol. \nMy present lineup of meds is lamictal 300mg/daily, prozac 60mg/daily, and .25mg of xanax as needed.\n\n\n\n\nThe issue presently is that I feel as though the prozac is giving me extreme lethargy, which apparently is not a side-effect (according to wikipedia). In general, it mades me feel like that stereotypical view of how antidepressants feel. I feel like my range of emotion is extremely limited, I mostly feel like a total zombie, ect. Which, I have never experienced with my other meds, although those didn't end up working out for other reasons. Has anyone else experienced this with prozac? My doc said these are not usually side effects of prozac, but I feel strongly that they're the cause. \n\n\n\n\nI have an upcoming appointment, and I'm nervous to bring up my issues with prozac again. I don't want to seem like I'm making it up or something, but I feel absolutely miserable for a variety of reasons related to the side-effects that I'm perceiving. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*tl;dr*: I've gone through several antidepressants  for the treatment of my general anxiety and panic disorder to help with the treatment of Bipolar II. Almost all of them have been terrible for me, side effect wise. I'm losing hope about the medication situation, and afraid my doctor thinks I'm bullshitting her.

Mainly because I just want thoughts, impressions, and something like advice on how to handle the situation going forward.  I&amp;#39;m not exactly looking for &amp;#39;telling me what to do&amp;#39; advice though also.  Of course much of this is dysfunctional to say the least, but I&amp;#39;d like to request that you try and minimize any judgement, as it&amp;#39;ll just make me feel worse, won&amp;#39;t help anything, and what&amp;#39;s happened has already happened..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m often compelled, especially with emotionally fraught stuff, to go into detail.  I only have a few people I can talk to about this.  I haven&amp;#39;t been in therapy for awhile for various reasons.  My psydoc is pretty good and has been seeing me for several years.  But I&amp;#39;m having problems with my insurance, but I&amp;#39;ve already made an appointment for a few more weeks from now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s going to be kind of long and rambling, but sequential for the most part.  I do believe it&amp;#39;s crucial to understand my issues by seeing all the backstory.  But hopefully the fact that one can skim it if necessary will make it so that too many people won&amp;#39;t just skip reading it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am married with two daughters, one between 11 and 14 and the other between 6 and 9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have bipolar disorder, 1 I think.  Usually hypomanic but if unmedicated long enough will become manic.  Generalized anxiety that has given me functional deficits; was on disability since 2010 but after the first review last year got denied and missed the appeal time period, because I didn&amp;#39;t foresee getting denied and was getting worse and worse about having my head in the sand about looking at the mail since around early 2016.  I thought they would just get the newer information from my doctor, even though I know it should have occurred to me that they would most likely try and deny me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have a type of generalized, closely-related to an even more than usual anxiety-based type of OCD, in comparison to classic germaphobia, etc., where I have meltdowns if someone tries to make me do something that is other than the only way i know how to or want to do them. And with conversations involving information, I always have to &amp;#39;make sure&amp;#39; the person said exactly what I thought they said, when it might be clear but sounds ambiguous to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.  And a lot of mild to extreme stubbornness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All three of those disorders send me into rages and tirades, unfortunately against my family because we live together.  Frustration, irritability, but I think it&amp;#39;s often kind of &amp;#39;impotent.&amp;#39;  Passive-aggressive maybe?  Don&amp;#39;t know; all that gets kind of confusing for me.  But sometimes I guess it causes people to be drawn to that possibly perceived weakness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But being provoked and dismissed puts me on the edge of thinking quite violently, and I&amp;#39;m always having to hold back literally striking out at whoever is doing it to me.  It&amp;#39;s been years and I haven&amp;#39;t really yet, as I don&amp;#39;t want to get arrested etc.  And I don&amp;#39;t really believe in just reacting back in retaliation and physically hurting anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the years of hoarding, both my husband and I, and his actual ADD, and my symptoms of it; the disorganization problems just worsen the hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general I get overwhelmed easily, confused easily..forget stuff more and more.  My constant fuck-ups and more and more &amp;#39;dropping the ball&amp;#39; takes its toll on my family.  But with my conditions and personality any criticism and negative reactions from them just angers and hurts me and it&amp;#39;s so hard, because surely it wouldn&amp;#39;t be like that nearly as much if I didn&amp;#39;t have mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know it&amp;#39;s bad for me and from what I&amp;#39;ve heard and read contributes to a lot of my current symptoms as far as the bipolar, but I only get like 4 hours sleep a night, (but then sleep for 3 hours or so after getting the girls out the door for school).  I mostly only eat carbs and some protein.  I &amp;#39;kind of&amp;#39; want to make meals, but I&amp;#39;m so tired and the kitchen is so cluttered that all we eat is pasta and smoked sausage (as opposed to hot dogs).  I keep buying some fruit and bags of spinach..The kids are tired of apples for now.  Perishable food is a struggle.  The refrigerators currently working are small and old.  My husband does make stuff every so often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t take vitamins, but used to. We&amp;#39;re always getting colds and stomach viruses.  (especially now that school&amp;#39;s started).  I don&amp;#39;t exercise, but used to.  Just general depression symptoms of struggling everyday to just get through the day and get the minimum done without sleeping all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to the current issue:  mother-in-laws can be hard enough to deal with it seems, but it doesn&amp;#39;t help when you have mental illnesses that inconvenience them and cause you to make more and more mistakes that may or may not affect them.  Husbands too, but that&amp;#39;s of course something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll call her &amp;#39;mil&amp;#39; - short for mother-in-law, but mostly &amp;#39;she&amp;#39;. As far as the situation between her and me, it&amp;#39;s also worsened because of whatever conditions she has or may have..definitely some type of personality disorder or personality issues contributing to a bullying mentality, being judgmental, automatically thinking she&amp;#39;s always right, always has to have the last word.  Critical and verbally abusive, especially in calling others names.  Insulting.  Sometimes cruel.  Has less than no patience much of the time, and especially for annoying, &amp;#39;flaky&amp;#39; people and the situations they create.  Holds grudges for years, often, imo, about relatively trivial crap.  She&amp;#39;s educated, but refers to mental professionals as shrinks.  Too smart for her own good, for lack of a better phrase. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met her when I was nine when she and her son moved onto our street.  She was really charming much of the time..Introverted and social at the same time; often charismatic.  We live in a medium large town in the eastern midwest.  She is from here, but moved to a large city out west in the 60&amp;#39;s.  She loves &amp;#39;the counterculture.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, she, and later her son, fascinated me.  I was pretty lonely, and loved their what seemed to be so much knowledge about so many things.  Off and on for years, when she wasn&amp;#39;t too irritated with me, she actually seemed to enjoy talking to me.  She has some of the best stories.  But I&amp;#39;ve unfortunately chosen to confide in her pretty much up til about several years ago, but then as I realized the depth and increase in her dislike for me, I finally have gradually reduced that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As her son became my boyfriend and we started spending a lot of time together, she told him she wanted me to not come over any more for awhile (she wanted a break from me.)  I remember trying to talk to her a couple of weeks later when I saw her outside.  She gave me &amp;#39;the silent treatment&amp;#39; then and for awhile.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband has always done that some too.  He has the sometimes-harsh treatment of people, or at least talking about them behind their backs like that, and some of that similar cruelty towards the kids and I, I guess partly because of living with her all his life.  He was an only child and she was a single mother.  They moved back here when he was 11.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he has depression and ADD, along with the hoarding, and anxiety seems to contribute to some of his anger as well.  When he&amp;#39;s off his medicine, he gets so angry that he punches holes in walls, throws stuff, sometimes breaks things, curses at me and then does the silent treatment (well, that&amp;#39;s even when he&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; his meds).  I hate that the most about him, when he does that.  Eventually I began yelling and screaming a lot more, like he also does, and feeling a strong urge to throw and break things.  Especially after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Especially when I&amp;#39;ve even a little hypomanic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next most behavior I hate is when he&amp;#39;s not on his meds, is physically restraining me or keeping me from going into another room or getting on our bed. And right now the beds are pretty much the only comfortable places to sit in our house.  So yeah, he loses a lot of control of adhering to personal space boundaries when he gets like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But mil&amp;#39;s done a lot for us.  Especially since the girls were born.  The older one (K.) is her favorite in many ways, and I don&amp;#39;t think she could live without her.  We let her stay with her half the week from the time she was about 7 months old until soon after my youngest (E.) was born, when K. was 3 1/2.  I knew K. would have started asking why she had to be at her house all the time while E. was always here with us.  So I ended it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning though, of course I jumped at the chance at the time for me to have more time to sleep and do more of what I wanted and was compelled to do.  It took a few years, but I realized that she didn&amp;#39;t do it to help me; she just wanted and needed to be with K.  So I guess I also gave her some of my power.  I also lost a lot of special moments I&amp;#39;ll never be able to get back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has annual festivals and things she pretty much always takes them to, which are pretty much really important to her, and thus she wants to and always has no matter what.  She also has them both on Friday afternoons and evenings.  It used to be and additional day of the week for K. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And after I happened to lose a form she gave me to fill out for a summer activity for E.(this past summer), she told me she wasn&amp;#39;t paying for it after all, since she was trying to reduce stress in her life.  I think that&amp;#39;s why she isn&amp;#39;t having them over as much either.  She has a lot of energy, but &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; 73 now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She also pays and has paid for a lot of stuff; years of dance lessons for K. (all her idea), K.&amp;#39;s 2 years of preschool and one year of kindergarten, given us various amounts of money, none of which we ever asked for, when she could tell we needed it especially to make up for stuff we had to pay for but didn&amp;#39;t really have the money to.  And large amounts for my husband&amp;#39;s birthdays, and for Christmas for him and the girls. And many more things I can&amp;#39;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s always this constant underlying, mostly unspoken tension between her and I.  We both hold back from confronting each other as much as possible, but I think with her increasing age, she&amp;#39;s losing the ability to do that.  But she would have her little blowups/tantrums &amp;#39;at&amp;#39; me every so often, and then would act like it never happened, so I went along with that, because I don&amp;#39;t deal well with people even saying anything in anger to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, finally to the main stuff that happened the other night!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She left with the girls this past weekend for a 4 day trip to a quaint historically significant &amp;quot;tourist attraction&amp;quot;.  Not to sound rude, but it&amp;#39;s not the usual type of tourist attraction; it&amp;#39;s more of a simple, quiet place where you can stay in restored old buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They always go on this weekend every year because the place has their big fall festival that has lots of kids activities as well.  K. has always enjoyed going, and this was E&amp;#39;s first year going, and she really liked it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She always gives us either an exact time or time range in which she is ready to drop them off or for us to come pick them up.  I guess this might be the norm for people with children; I don&amp;#39;t know (probably is; not complaining though) but it&amp;#39;s assumed that we have to be ready for any change in that time, because she&amp;#39;s the one going to the trouble to take them somewhere.  And it has changed before, even at the last minute, where we sometimes have to go pick them up instead.  She told me they&amp;#39;d be back sometime close to; before or after, dark.  She said she would be able to drop them off.  She also hates cell phones with a passion, and of course refuses to get one or for us to give her one, because they are not as reliable as landlines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You probably can tell where this is going, but of course I want to tell it bit by bit.  I really have been trying to be kind of concise in everything I&amp;#39;ve typed.  So then, 3 hours before they could be here at the earliest, my husband decides he needs to go to our other house and cut the grass and dry our laundry there.  I asked him if he would probably be back in a couple of hours.  He said probably, but maybe longer, depending on how much stuff he decided to do there.  This house was our first one, but we had to leave pretty quickly for various reasons when K. was a baby.  We&amp;#39;ve used it for storage, which I realized was a bad idea a year or so later, but it already was filled with a hoard anyhow.  It&amp;#39;s also in disrepair, so my husband is always working on it off and on.  He refuses to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back, of course I realize I should have told him when to be back no matter what.  He should have thought of it as well.  Only one of our cars is driveable, and I have a suspended license until I get a day and time assigned to go to traffic school and complete that.  Yes, once again I put off looking at the mail to see when the original day was set for or that I needed to set it up first; I don&amp;#39;t know.  So then they suspended it because I went past the deadline.  She knows about it; I had to tell her since up until then I have mostly been the one to be here when she picks them up and drops them off, and to go pick them when it was my turn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So of course she calls maybe a half hour or hour after he left, and said they were exhausted, and asked if he could come get them.  I told her everything about what my husband was doing and where she was, and we both thought he would probably be back in time, or that I would be able to reach him on his phone.  I knew that wasn&amp;#39;t always the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I waited until about a little more than an hour later, after trying to call him repeatedly, and then called her and asked if she&amp;#39;d heard from him.  She said no, and was starting to sound irritated.  I told her I could try and call one of our old neighbors, or even run over there myself.  It&amp;#39;s about a twenty minute walk from where we live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then just said something about how she couldn&amp;#39;t bring them because she didn&amp;#39;t have her car and that she couldn&amp;#39;t drive the one she had at night.  Then she screamed, &amp;quot;Why can&amp;#39;t I have a normal fucking family?  You all just aren&amp;#39;t living right.&amp;quot;  Then she hung up on me.  She&amp;#39;s done it before; my husband has done it many times.  Of course my kids told me afterward that she was as mad and loud as she&amp;#39;s ever been, talking about me and my suspended license and other stuff, but mostly about me.  K. has also told me about her saying the not living right thing stuff before, from a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got hold of my husband soon after, and he said that he hadn&amp;#39;t even felt his phone vibrate and that he&amp;#39;d been of course running the lawnmower, working on the roof some, and waiting for the laundry to dry, but would go get them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t out there when he did.  She&amp;#39;s done that to me too, also when she&amp;#39;s been angry with K. about something.  We did always tell her to just call us when she got overwhelmed after that happened once.  Sometimes she still didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was upset and angry also.  It took me a couple of days to calm down.  I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep well that night, worrying about it.  It kept going through my head constantly.  At first I felt very confrontational, even though I knew that would just make things worse.  I&amp;#39;m just so tired of being walked all over.  Yes, by my husband and her, but of course there are a lot of different issues there.  I called my dad and a friend and talked to then about it.  I&amp;#39;ve been writing this off and on all week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now think that she tried to hold it all in like she always does, at first, but this time she couldn&amp;#39;t, because of how physically bad she felt and whatever else, and was just so exasperated.  That&amp;#39;s understandable.  I know I can&amp;#39;t expect people who have to deal with us all the time and know what the house looks like to not get frustrated and say things in anger sometimes.  And then there&amp;#39;s her age again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, my husband has never been much help, because he knows we can&amp;#39;t make her stop doing anything; that she&amp;#39;s not going to listen to us, and not going to change.  We&amp;#39;ve both known all the stuff we&amp;#39;ve done wrong that she&amp;#39;s held against us.  So he didn&amp;#39;t say much except for being irritated and cutting me off about what she said; saying he already remembered me telling him she said that last part before. I&amp;#39;d forgotten; I forget so much of all kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know many of you will say we should have gotten divorced long ago.  We almost did, lots of times.  But there are many reasons why we don&amp;#39;t want to, and why neither of us could do it now.  Of course there have been and still are so many good things about him, between us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve seen them in arguments, etc. before a couple of times ever since we were teenagers, pretty much always because she started talking some kind of shit to him.  So I&amp;#39;m now leaning towards the acting like she didn&amp;#39;t say anything choice for when I have to talk to her again tomorrow (Friday).  I haven&amp;#39;t had to see her since that Sunday night.  She usually gets the kids after E. gets off the bus those afternoons.  Then, unless we&amp;#39;ve already talked about it, I have to see when she says she wants him to come get them.  I could tell the kids to have her call my husband later; I&amp;#39;ve done that before, but ahead of time, when I felt like it was a situation where I&amp;#39;d rather him deal with her, but not at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to go out there after E. gets here, so I don&amp;#39;t look even more weak.  Then again, sometimes K. will go out first, since she gets home an hour earlier, and then she can just come back in and tell me the time.  Or she might choose to call him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she says or seems like I need to say something new, I guess I&amp;#39;ll tell her me and her can just adjust things somehow to where this could be more likely to be prevented in the future..she always does tell us however she wants this or that too, now that I think of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess mostly you all will just be able to comment on this.  If you want of course.  But I doubt things will go any differently than they&amp;#39;re going to.  Thanks for listening to me about this large section of my life.  That&amp;#39;s partly why it took so long. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I wanted to post this to both bipolar reddit groups, which I hope is o.k.  Mainly because I just want thoughts, impressions, and something like advice on how to handle the situation going forward.  I'm not exactly looking for 'telling me what to do' advice though also.  Of course much of this is dysfunctional to say the least, but I'd like to request that you try and minimize any judgement, as it'll just make me feel worse, won't help anything, and what's happened has already happened..\n\nAnd I'm often compelled, especially with emotionally fraught stuff, to go into detail.  I only have a few people I can talk to about this.  I haven't been in therapy for awhile for various reasons.  My psydoc is pretty good and has been seeing me for several years.  But I'm having problems with my insurance, but I've already made an appointment for a few more weeks from now. \n\nSo it's going to be kind of long and rambling, but sequential for the most part.  I do believe it's crucial to understand my issues by seeing all the backstory.  But hopefully the fact that one can skim it if necessary will make it so that too many people won't just skip reading it altogether.\n\nI am married with two daughters, one between 11 and 14 and the other between 6 and 9.\n\nI have bipolar disorder, 1 I think.  Usually hypomanic but if unmedicated long enough will become manic.  Generalized anxiety that has given me functional deficits; was on disability since 2010 but after the first review last year got denied and missed the appeal time period, because I didn't foresee getting denied and was getting worse and worse about having my head in the sand about looking at the mail since around early 2016.  I thought they would just get the newer information from my doctor, even though I know it should have occurred to me that they would most likely try and deny me again.\n\nI also have a type of generalized, closely-related to an even more than usual anxiety-based type of OCD, in comparison to classic germaphobia, etc., where I have meltdowns if someone tries to make me do something that is other than the only way i know how to or want to do them. And with conversations involving information, I always have to 'make sure' the person said exactly what I thought they said, when it might be clear but sounds ambiguous to *me*.  And a lot of mild to extreme stubbornness.\n\nAll three of those disorders send me into rages and tirades, unfortunately against my family because we live together.  Frustration, irritability, but I think it's often kind of 'impotent.'  Passive-aggressive maybe?  Don't know; all that gets kind of confusing for me.  But sometimes I guess it causes people to be drawn to that possibly perceived weakness.  \n\nBut being provoked and dismissed puts me on the edge of thinking quite violently, and I'm always having to hold back literally striking out at whoever is doing it to me.  It's been years and I haven't really yet, as I don't want to get arrested etc.  And I don't really believe in just reacting back in retaliation and physically hurting anyone.\n\nAnd then there's the years of hoarding, both my husband and I, and his actual ADD, and my symptoms of it; the disorganization problems just worsen the hoarding.\n\nIn general I get overwhelmed easily, confused easily..forget stuff more and more.  My constant fuck-ups and more and more 'dropping the ball' takes its toll on my family.  But with my conditions and personality any criticism and negative reactions from them just angers and hurts me and it's so hard, because surely it wouldn't be like that nearly as much if I didn't have mental illness.\n\nAnd I know it's bad for me and from what I've heard and read contributes to a lot of my current symptoms as far as the bipolar, but I only get like 4 hours sleep a night, (but then sleep for 3 hours or so after getting the girls out the door for school).

Husbands too, but that's of course something else.\n\nI'll call her 'mil' - short for mother-in-law, but mostly 'she'. As far as the situation between her and me, it's also worsened because of whatever conditions she has or may have..definitely some type of personality disorder or personality issues contributing to a bullying mentality, being judgmental, automatically thinking she's always right, always has to have the last word.  Critical and verbally abusive, especially in calling others names.  Insulting.  Sometimes cruel.  Has less than no patience much of the time, and especially for annoying, 'flaky' people and the situations they create.  Holds grudges for years, often, imo, about relatively trivial crap.

We've used it for storage, which I realized was a bad idea a year or so later, but it already was filled with a hoard anyhow.  It's also in disrepair, so my husband is always working on it off and on.  He refuses to sell it.\n\nLooking back, of course I realize I should have told him when to be back no matter what.  He should have thought of it as well.  Only one of our cars is driveable, and I have a suspended license until I get a day and time assigned to go to traffic school and complete that.  Yes, once again I put off looking at the mail to see when the original day was set for or that I needed to set it up first; I don't know.  So then they suspended it because I went past the deadline.  She knows about it; I had to tell her since up until then I have mostly been the one to be here when she picks them up and drops them off, and to go pick them when it was my turn.  \n\nSo of course she calls maybe a half hour or hour after he left, and said they were exhausted, and asked if he could come get them.  I told her everything about what my husband was doing and where she was, and we both thought he would probably be back in time, or that I would be able to reach him on his phone.  I knew that wasn't always the case.\n\nSo I waited until about a little more than an hour later, after trying to call him repeatedly, and then called her and asked if she'd heard from him.  She said no, and was starting to sound irritated.  I told her I could try and call one of our old neighbors, or even run over there myself.  It's about a twenty minute walk from where we live.\n\nShe then just said something about how she couldn't bring them because she didn't have her car and that she couldn't drive the one she had at night.  Then she screamed, \"Why can't I have a normal fucking family?  You all just aren't living right.\"  Then she hung up on me.  She's done it before; my husband has done it many times.  Of course my kids told me afterward that she was as mad and loud as she's ever been, talking about me and my suspended license and other stuff, but mostly about me.  K. has also told me about her saying the not living right thing stuff before, from a few years ago.\n\nI got hold of my husband soon after, and he said that he hadn't even felt his phone vibrate and that he'd been of course running the lawnmower, working on the roof some, and waiting for the laundry to dry, but would go get them.\n\nShe wasn't out there when he did.  She's done that to me too, also when she's been angry with K. about something.  We did always tell her to just call us when she got overwhelmed after that happened once.  Sometimes she still didn't.\n\nI was upset and angry also.  It took me a couple of days to calm down.  I couldn't sleep well that night, worrying about it.  It kept going through my head constantly.  At first I felt very confrontational, even though I knew that would just make things worse.  I'm just so tired of being walked all over.  Yes, by my husband and her, but of course there are a lot of different issues there.  I called my dad and a friend and talked to then about it.  I've been writing this off and on all week.\n\nI now think that she tried to hold it all in like she always does, at first, but this time she couldn't, because of how physically bad she felt and whatever else, and was just so exasperated.  That's understandable.  I know I can't expect people who have to deal with us all the time and know what the house looks like to not get frustrated and say things in anger sometimes.  And then there's her age again.\n\nNo, my husband has never been much help, because he knows we can't make her stop doing anything; that she's not going to listen to us, and not going to change.  We've both known all the stuff we've done wrong that she's held against us.  So he didn't say much except for being irritated and cutting me off about what she said; saying he already remembered me telling him she said that last part before. I'd forgotten; I forget so much of all kinds of things.\n\nI know many of you will say we should have gotten divorced long ago.  We almost did, lots of times.  But there are many reasons why we don't want to, and why neither of us could do it now.  Of course there have been and still are so many good things about him, between us.\n\nBut I've seen them in arguments, etc. before a couple of times ever since we were teenagers, pretty much always because she started talking some kind of shit to him.  So I'm now leaning towards the acting like she didn't say anything choice for when I have to talk to her again tomorrow (Friday).  I haven't had to see her since that Sunday night.  She usually gets the kids after E. gets off the bus those afternoons.  Then, unless we've already talked about it, I have to see when she says she wants him to come get them.  I could tell the kids to have her call my husband later; I've done that before, but ahead of time, when I felt like it was a situation where I'd rather him deal with her, but not at the last minute.\n\nI want to go out there after E. gets here, so I don't look even more weak.  Then again, sometimes K. will go out first, since she gets home an hour earlier, and then she can just come back in and tell me the time.  Or she might choose to call him.\n\nIf she says or seems like I need to say something new, I guess I'll tell her me and her can just adjust things somehow to where this could be more likely to be prevented in the future..she always does tell us however she wants this or that too, now that I think of it.\n\nSo I guess mostly you all will just be able to comment on this.  If you want of course.  But I doubt things will go any differently than they're going to.  Thanks for listening to me about this large section of my life.  That's partly why it took so long.

In early high school, I decided I could cope without them and went off them. A few years later, after my bipolar diagnosis, I was struggling with focus and motivation when euthymic, and my pdoc suggested going back on ADHD meds.

I tried every off label option - Strattera(didn&amp;#39;t work), Intuniv (made me faint, Kapvay probably would too), even wellbutrin (no effect). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did some research, and it looked like there were two tenous options left. Modafinil(provigil) which has some stimulant effects (did okay in efficacy trials for ADHD, but the risk of SJS was deemed too high) and could possibly cause mania, or tricyclic antidepressants (side effects, probably not worth it). I asked my pdoc about trying provigil, and he agreed that it was worth a try, especially as it could also help with my hypersomnia and inability to wake up in the mornings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a little nervous about trying provigil as I can get uncomfortable hypomanic symptoms from as little as one cup of coffee, but I did some reading and it looks like provigil induced mania is much less likely than for vyvanse(it&amp;#39;s still possible. I make sure to chart my mood and watch my behavior, especially when adjusting dose.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The studies on provigil for pediatric ADHD used a 400mg dose in the mornings. My doctor prescribed me 100mg pills and said to take up to 2 doses of 200mg each per day. I have been taking 200mg in the mornings when I need to get to an early class, about an hour before I plan to wake up(otherwise I really struggle with alarm clocks), I haven&amp;#39;t found much efficacy for focus, but it has been able to help me fix my sleep schedule. I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily recommend it for ADHD (I haven&amp;#39;t noticed much of an effect), but for treating hypersomnia, it seems to work great. It seems to have no effect on my mood, and no uncomfortable symptoms like racing thoughts or jitteriness that I find with normal stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have found basic lifestyle changes(regular schedule, write down work, exercise, check in with a therapist every week) to have made a much bigger difference in my productivity than any focus boost from provigil, but it is part of how I&amp;#39;m maintaining a regular schedule. I wonder if a higher dose like they used in the studies would have more of an effect, but I do not want to risk mania, and I&amp;#39;m doing pretty well with lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Tried provigil as off label ADHD med.

I asked my pdoc about trying provigil, and he agreed that it was worth a try, especially as it could also help with my hypersomnia and inability to wake up in the mornings. \n\nI was a little nervous about trying provigil as I can get uncomfortable hypomanic symptoms from as little as one cup of coffee, but I did some reading and it looks like provigil induced mania is much less likely than for vyvanse(it's still possible. I make sure to chart my mood and watch my behavior, especially when adjusting dose.)\n\nThe studies on provigil for pediatric ADHD used a 400mg dose in the mornings. My doctor prescribed me 100mg pills and said to take up to 2 doses of 200mg each per day. I have been taking 200mg in the mornings when I need to get to an early class, about an hour before I plan to wake up(otherwise I really struggle with alarm clocks), I haven't found much efficacy for focus, but it has been able to help me fix my sleep schedule. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for ADHD (I haven't noticed much of an effect), but for treating hypersomnia, it seems to work great. It seems to have no effect on my mood, and no uncomfortable symptoms like racing thoughts or jitteriness that I find with normal stimulants.\n\nI have found basic lifestyle changes(regular schedule, write down work, exercise, check in with a therapist every week) to have made a much bigger difference in my productivity than any focus boost from provigil, but it is part of how I'm maintaining a regular schedule. I wonder if a higher dose like they used in the studies would have more of an effect, but I do not want to risk mania, and I'm doing pretty well with lifestyle changes.\n\nTL;DR: Tried provigil as off label ADHD med. Doesn't work great for ADHD(lifestyle changes helped much more), but does help with hypersomnia.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "72d9ab", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Modafinil update.

When i was 19 i heavily abused drugs (mainly benzos/opiates) but detoxed and was sober for a year but relasped. Im now on a benzo taper which is calculated to be a year. To keep a long story short i was just given Lamitcal off label by my addiction psychiatrist for my treatment resistant depression. Ive now been on it for 4 days lowest dose and have felt like a complete zombie, no appetite, a lot more depressed, extreme mood swings.

I forgot what I was going to say about this, sorry, but it&amp;#39;s been a struggling to find the right anti psychotic. But I have hope what he just put me on will help, he said it works really fast. Oh, I remember now. Prior to this hospitalization, I felt like I had entities in my head that tell me to do things and comment on what I do. They were basically gone since discharge but these &amp;#39;entities&amp;#39; has come back.
