The first time was very intense she said. We were in bed talking, and we having a small argument. She rolled over and stopped talking to me. I apologised, and when i asked things like if she was okay, she\u2019d nod her head and squeeze my hand. I waited about 10 minutes and out of nowhere she started tearing up and eventually balled her eyes out. She told me she couldn\u2019t get any words out, and it was almost like something wasn\u2019t letting her talk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time it happened was very strange, we were having a bit of a vent together about all the shit going on, and i had a vent about me feeling a bit shitty lately and that i don\u2019t tell her stuff like that because shes going through enough, and she kist sort of froze up, started crying, and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I pretty quickly realised it was similar to last time, so i brought her outside and sat her down next to me with a blanket. I was assuring her she was okay and to breath steadily, and that i was her and understood she was going through a similar anxiety attack.

The first time was very intense she said. We were in bed talking, and we having a small argument. She rolled over and stopped talking to me. I apologised, and when i asked things like if she was okay, she\u2019d nod her head and squeeze my hand. I waited about 10 minutes and out of nowhere she started tearing up and eventually balled her eyes out. She told me she couldn\u2019t get any words out, and it was almost like something wasn\u2019t letting her talk. \n\nThe last time it happened was very strange, we were having a bit of a vent together about all the shit going on, and i had a vent about me feeling a bit shitty lately and that i don\u2019t tell her stuff like that because shes going through enough, and she kist sort of froze up, started crying, and wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I pretty quickly realised it was similar to last time, so i brought her outside and sat her down next to me with a blanket. I was assuring her she was okay and to breath steadily, and that i was her and understood she was going through a similar anxiety attack.

I then experienced extreme derealisation, which again I have felt before, but this whole event was weird.\n\nIt's been 10 or so minutes since, and I figured out a solution to what I was doing in game, but why did it make me panic so much? Is it possible that the screen use has just been so excessive that I am now getting TOO involved in the screen, and need to step back? I felt like I'd lost my mind a little... it was scary. I was having one of the worst panic attacks of my life, because I felt stuck in there somehow whilst my brain had gone blank. I can't seem to explain this part properly. Extreme confusion, is all can I say it was. Any suggestions? I'm now slightly anxious about even being here on the computer.

I gave her a lot of reasons and symptoms for what's been happening recently in my life and she gave me zoloft to fix it.. the one thing I didn't tell her is that I also think that the xanax abuse a year ago gave me anxiety or will that be out of her interest and not want to give me any more drugs such as zoloft or cloneazepam??\n\nI really feel like cloneazepam .25ng or .5mg would help me but I don't believe I can just ask ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i85kq", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Doctor for anxiety", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7i85kq", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7i85kq/doctor_for_anxiety/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512697492.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7i85kq/doctor_for_anxiety/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "myweirdself", "created_utc": 1512668692.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(CRAZY LONG POST)\nI&amp;#39;ve suffered from anxiety amongst other mental Heath problems for a while now.

I had another bad episode of depression/anxiety shortly after we got together but he was always so supportive. My mom calls him an angel. That aside, we have yet to have a comfortable living situation and this one takes the cake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried to go back to work multiple times but my symptoms always get in the way and although my supervisors generally like me as a person and I work hard, those damn symptoms always come creeping back up and I would eventually be forced to quit. So when looking for a place to stay, we needed something cheap. Two people on one income is apparently not enough to live on your own anymore and it doesn&amp;#39;t help I&amp;#39;ve acquired two pets during better times, which throws a wrench in renting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, a long time friend of my husband&amp;#39;s had a room available for only $300/mo which we thought was perfect. Plus our nephew already lived in the house, so how bad could it be? We moved into the house in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew the house was dirty but everyone made it seem like they were willing to make changes and I didn&amp;#39;t know just how many people came in and out of here (mostly for weed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also didn&amp;#39;t know how big of a problem the new roommate&amp;#39;s SO was going to be... granted she doesn&amp;#39;t live in the house, but she tries her fucking best to run the show. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind too much if she wasn&amp;#39;t drunk all the time, never cleaned, complained constantly, and anything I do try to improve the situation is an insult to her. She has a victim complex so nothing is ever her fault. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her boyfriend (the roommate) is pretty much the same, but he never ranted about how much he cleans. He admits he&amp;#39;s lazy. My issue with him is he&amp;#39;s been handed everything his entire life and takes every bit of it for granted. The house was GIVEN to him in September and he does no maintenance what-so-ever. This house is the eye-sore of the street, which makes me sad to think of how much work his grandparents put into making this once a beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are various barrels and cans full of trash around the outside of the house, neither lawn mower works because he keeps leaving them outside, food waste, garbage, piles of clothes everywhere, and within the last month we&amp;#39;ve began having a cockroach infestation. The carpets are matted with messes that have never been cleaned.. Oh, and there are now THREE giant weed plants in the living room which scares the shit out of me because in my husband and my roommate&amp;#39;s younger years, the roommate was very quick to blame other people for anything he may have gotten in trouble for. I don&amp;#39;t trust him to take sole responsibility for them even though we want them gone, so I&amp;#39;ve started slowly poisoning them with salt water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that I don&amp;#39;t have OCD, but I have had it recognized by a doctor that I do have some strong tendencies and my anxiety only fuels the urge to have everything in order all the time. I&amp;#39;ve had to hold back a lot and it&amp;#39;s hard for me. We have absolutely no say in the house. We can&amp;#39;t say anything about how gross it is, that we want the plants GONE, that we do not feel comfortable with him inviting high school kids that are a decade or more younger than all of us to the house to smoke and drink with. It&amp;#39;s killed me to have to sit and watch as the roommate and the girlfriend would leave her kids in the car, run inside to hit the bong a few times, or even worse, I watched the two of them pass a joint in between each other on the back deck with her two little girls playing around them (they&amp;#39;re in kindergarten and first grade). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s weird in that she copies me... much more so in the beginning. She switched all of her beauty products to what I used (which I found out when I went to hunt down a missing towel in their bathroom) and that really creeped me out. Once I got permission to cut some of roses (what&amp;#39;s left of them...) outside and made a bouquet in a vase (I even joked it was the one classy place in the house) and within a couple hours, she added a tiny one in a trashy shot glass right next to it... sigh. Those are just a couple examples. Stupid, sure, but I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what the hell her deal is and maybe that&amp;#39;s a clue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it all got to the point where I just couldn&amp;#39;t deal with her anymore. I&amp;#39;ve taken the silent approach, because I&amp;#39;m scared I&amp;#39;ll say something I&amp;#39;ll regret. Every word that comes out of her mouth is just face palm after face palm. So I just try to go about my business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She would still use our bathroom (because the vanity light and outlet didn&amp;#39;t work in their&amp;#39;s) and would not only leave her shit everywhere but would steal my things... tampons (a very noticeable about, not just the emergency situation), rolls of toilet paper, any kind of hair products, bobby pins, hair ties, etc. until I had almost nothing left. I&amp;#39;ve had to hide a lot of my stuff or put it in a lock box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is such a long rant and I could keep going... but my depression and anxiety are constantly taking major hits everyday. &amp;quot;Oh god, she&amp;#39;s here?!&amp;quot; BAM, anxiety. &amp;quot;Oh, she&amp;#39;s throwing an impromptu dinner party at midnight while I&amp;#39;m grabbing my laundry?&amp;quot; BAM, panic attack in front of a crowd of strangers. I have had so many panic attacks and new stuff is always happening. Lately she&amp;#39;s taken to writing hateful notes about how I need to &amp;quot;get off my ass and help my husband&amp;quot; and I &amp;quot;have no right to ask her to clean&amp;quot;, that I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot;... and so on. I try to ignore them, but they still eat at me and wear away what little self-esteem I have left. My husband finally put his foot down last night and told our roommate she better cut out with the notes and to never call me crazy and to quit insulting me. I don&amp;#39;t know if much will really change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t really explain that I&amp;#39;m severely anxious/depressed because they wouldn&amp;#39;t understand and they would probably just claim they have it too but they still work... they&amp;#39;re great at bullshitting their way out of situations, which I guess is about the only compliment I can give either of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the nephew moved out with his fiance. They both felt exactly the same and she suffers from anxiety as well so I was nice to have an ally and some one to relate to in the house, but now they&amp;#39;re gone and they don&amp;#39;t come around. In fact... almost none of our roommate&amp;#39;s friends come around anymore. I guess that&amp;#39;s why they hang out with high school kids now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m just at a loss. There&amp;#39;s no where for us to go. No one is both willing and able to help us get out of here. We&amp;#39;ve been promised my husband&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s place when they finally find a house to purchase but that could be months or more and right now I&amp;#39;m struggling every day to stay sane. We live paycheck to paycheck and have no savings and a lot of debt so I we can just get out own place. I&amp;#39;ve debated multiple time if I should go to the hospital... but I&amp;#39;m too scared and it may just be more of a &amp;quot;I need to get the fuck out of here&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m to the point where on weekdays when my husband is at work, I only leave the room when absolutely necessary. I don&amp;#39;t eat or drink all day so I won&amp;#39;t have to venture out to the bathroom. I&amp;#39;m scared I&amp;#39;ll run into her or find mean notes. I can&amp;#39;t focus on anything.

Already after the first week of treatment, Mirtazapine made me sleepy at 10pm, and it let me sleep for 9-10 hours, sometimes even more. It was fantastic. I could suddenly wake up like a traditional &amp;quot;working adult&amp;quot;, take a morning cup of coffee at 6 or 7, eyes sharp like razors, read a newspaper and look out the window and seeing street cleaners and busy-people hurrying to their places in life. &amp;quot;Is this what dad felt like all those mornings in the &amp;#39;80s?&amp;quot;, I wondered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was three months in and I felt fantastic, if still a bit aloof and cottony in my mind at times, which is common in the first phase of Mirtazapine treatment. Sometimes the artificial sleepiness could get somewhat annoying, with me being in a dream I couldn&amp;#39;t snap out of. It wasn&amp;#39;t sleep paralysis since I was in the dream and not truly self-aware, but I kept having these really boring and repetitive dreams where it feels like you are walking through deep mud. Sometimes, when I finally got out of bed and stood up, I felt like &amp;quot;Ugh, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Still, it did not happen every morning, and even when it did, I still felt rested from the long sleep, so I thought no more of it. Also, they were never nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months, and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life. The only benefit left in the medicine was the mild mental cushioning it provided, but at the same time I started to suspect that what I needed wasn&amp;#39;t cushioning but to make new constructive life decisions, that only I could make. Not my friends, not my family; me. My returning bad sleep cycle was a clue to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the sixth month, I noticed something one day: I had gained a lot of weight the past year due to inactivity. I had stopped going to the gym outright, for several months. The increased appetite from the medication also hadn&amp;#39;t helped. One day I had pushed through a really tough week at work and bought Taco ingredients for making a nice Friday night dinner and a movie. After the fifth Taco, I started noticing that not only did this taste like the best damn Tex-Mex dinner I ever ate, I actually got more hungry the more I ate. After seven Tacos, I walked to the kitchen to get a new beer, when I noticed my stomach was already full. As in, I would not be able to tie shoelaces. Still, my mind was fixed on the Tacos, I was ready for an 8th and a 9th one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when it hit me, the only time in my 30+ year life that I had this thought: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You know, you could just take a stroll to the bathroom, make some new space...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. I stood still for about 30 seconds in the hallway between living room and kitchen, turning it over in my head, feeling my happy and joyous hunger goading me on. And then I finally put the clues together, &amp;quot;These are borderline &lt;em&gt;Bulimia&lt;/em&gt; thoughts, damnit. Like hell I will!&amp;quot;. I said it out loud. There was no 8th Taco, and no visit to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A month later I quit Mirtazapine cold turkey. I had some slight withdrawals, bad sleep, and mildly itchy emotional turbulence for about 2-3 days, then I forgot that I&amp;#39;d ever taken it. Reminder: I am &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; outright encouraging others to go cold turkey. If you think you can hack it that&amp;#39;s your decision alone, only you know your own history with weaning off stuff. It&amp;#39;s still safest for most people to wean themselves off slowly, while keeping in touch with their doctor.

What I do know is that I won&amp;#39;t take Mirtazapine again, because I want to be in charge of my hunger, to earn it.

I quit and found a little job in a retail stationary store, just as a sales assistant for 12 hours a week. Although I had some overtime there which I didn\u2019t want to say no to, things were good and I came off my meds. I performed so well they offered me a supervisor role at only 20 hours and this seemed perfect. I didn\u2019t really think things through and 8 months later, I\u2019m back to square one as I\u2019m working easily 35-40 hours a week and the stress is unreal. I\u2019ve spoken to my boss and explained things, asking if we could sort something. Originally it was agreed we\u2019d drop my hours back to my contract but it was not possible and I\u2019m not able to do any less than 30 easy. Although a lot of people think oh it\u2019s only retail, it\u2019s quite a high stress environment and I find it difficult. \n\nThankfully I have a supportive partner who has advised me to hand in my notice, take some time to recover again and will support me in the long run. I have a side business which I\u2019m struggling to hit the ground running with but I dream everyday I can make this a money maker and work for myself. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on people I can speak to about potential careers that won\u2019t cause me to go back downhill? Do you have any experience and have come out the other side? \n\nThe happiest place I\u2019ve worked out has been just a supermarket role and even when I took on additional duties there, things were great. Is this something I should revisit or am I just reliving fond memories? \n\nI\u2019m not meaning to moan, more of a vent and just looking for anyone who\u2019s been in a similar situation. \n\nThanks in advance.

I can give actual recipes if you&amp;#39;d like, just let me know. I cook CONSTANTLY.\nEvery Sunday I head out to two or three different grocery stores and gather the ingredients for my weekly meal prep. Every Sunday Ron is even kinder to me than usual, because he knows how I feel about meal prep. It&amp;#39;s a love/hate relationship. It&amp;#39;s great because it means I don&amp;#39;t have to cook much during the rest of the week, and it&amp;#39;s healthy food that does my body (and my mind) good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I also feel like I could happily eat pizza every meal of the day.\u00a0 Every day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the lifetime of pizza isn&amp;#39;t an option, I focus on making meals that are filling, balanced and rich in anxiety-reducing nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know for some of you it&amp;#39;s a feat to make it out the door, much less to the grocery store. If it&amp;#39;s primarily social anxiety that affects you, try shopping at a grocery store that&amp;#39;s an hour or so away from your home. This trick was a tremendous asset to me while growing past my anxiety. Because, even if you have a panic attack in the store, you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about people recognizing you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, choose a store that&amp;#39;s far away. Get out a piece of paper and a pen and get ready.

I can give actual recipes if you'd like, just let me know. I cook CONSTANTLY.\nEvery Sunday I head out to two or three different grocery stores and gather the ingredients for my weekly meal prep. Every Sunday Ron is even kinder to me than usual, because he knows how I feel about meal prep. It's a love/hate relationship. It's great because it means I don't have to cook much during the rest of the week, and it's healthy food that does my body (and my mind) good.\n\nBut I also feel like I could happily eat pizza every meal of the day.\u00a0 Every day.\n\nSince the lifetime of pizza isn't an option, I focus on making meals that are filling, balanced and rich in anxiety-reducing nutrients.\n\nI know for some of you it's a feat to make it out the door, much less to the grocery store. If it's primarily social anxiety that affects you, try shopping at a grocery store that's an hour or so away from your home. This trick was a tremendous asset to me while growing past my anxiety. Because, even if you have a panic attack in the store, you don't have to worry about people recognizing you.\n\nSo, choose a store that's far away. Get out a piece of paper and a pen and get ready.

Yes I've spoken to new people and I've also been too afraid and social fobia kick in to talk way too little to some and not been able to act normal. \n\nThe last night I've done something that's kind of beautiful, but how much did I enjoy it?  Instead of going to the nightclub, we went to the beach nearby. Me and her, I've met at 2 different hostels now. I'm into her although not extremely, I just want/need something to happen. We walk the beach, we lay and talk in a hammock. We just say to go swimming in the ocean in the night and we do. We also just go into the resorts pool afterwards. It's freedom, but not really. I am instead of enjoying this would be magical moment,  worrying about the outcome of the night and if we could kiss and what I needed to do. She seems alright with everything else, however doesn't respond to my \"flirts\" and touches, definitely because they rather seem friendly but she's not interested. I am worrying but trying to get rid it every now and then to enjoy myself. (At the end we decide to have the taxi home, nothing happens.)\n\nIt also happens in general situations and not only special ones like this. I've been anxious while switching hostels, travelling to new places here and about talking to people and have heard I look like I hate people, so I try to relax and be happy and smile more. But the thoughts in my head are strong and not away for long each time.\n\nIt feels like being a spectator to my life, and it should be very good and enjoyable but it's definitely not. My brain doesn't let me be happy.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i3o3j", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Travelling paradise without enjoying it", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7i3o3j", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7i3o3j/travelling_paradise_without_enjoying_it/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512646529.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7i3o3j/travelling_paradise_without_enjoying_it/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "valenser", "created_utc": 1512617729.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with GAD about 13 years ago, and my anxiety is pretty high even when everything else in my life is going alright.

It was today when I was in trucking school, having a great time and learning something new. I\u2019d been slowly getting happier and more relaxed throughout the few weeks of this school so far, and realized that I\u2019m finally decompressing. That\u2019s when it hit. I was in the back while we were driving, waiting for us to switch out so I\u2019d have my turn. It hit me so hard, I thought I was going to die. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t move. I had lost control of my mind and my thoughts. Every alarm bell in my mind was telling me that death is here. It felt like 100lbs were on my chest and my pulse was too fast to count. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It eventually ended after what was probably 15 minutes but felt like forever.

And defeated the stress.  \n\nGuys..... I want to thank this subreddit for all the personal stories... for sharing your fears and successes.... \n\nIf this helps one person think even the tiniest little bit more confident in their ability to manage their anxiety.... i will smile the biggest smile.

I\u2019ve been to therapy a few times in my life and tried antidepressants and anxiety meds. I\u2019m not doing either of those right now due to a lack of insurance and a period of financial stress. My past experiences in therapy and treating my conditions always seem to lead me to the same place where I remain stuck. And that place is this: how much of my condition and symptoms do I take responsibility for, and how do I tell when I\u2019m just being too hard on myself?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been told by many professionals that one thing I can work on is being more compassionate and forgiving towards myself. Be gentle, don\u2019t say things to yourself you wouldn\u2019t say to a dear friend or a stranger, be kind, don\u2019t beat yourself up, love yourself, etc. That\u2019s all fine and those are absolutely things I need to work on. I am a perfectionist and very critical of myself. On the other hand, I am not delusional enough to think that my problems are entirely caused by things outside of my control - bad childhood, abusive parents, bullying, having shitty toxic friendships and relationships, etc. I\u2019m not interested in blaming my circumstances or those around me. It\u2019s my life and I am taking part in creating my reality, and would like to change myself for the better and make better decisions that lead me to a better quality of life. But when I try to make sense of something in my head, I end up getting extremely frustrated and bounce back and forth between \u201cokay you fucked up and here\u2019s a way to make it better...\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be so hard on yourself, it wasn\u2019t your fault\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most recently I have been in a very bad spot mental health wise, and also isolated from family members and friends due to a move. I saw a friend that I hadn\u2019t seen in a few years, as well as some of her newer aquaintences. I was really anxious going into these social interactions because I felt very out of practice, but in the moment I felt great and actually really had a wonderful time. I decided to say fuck it, I was just going to be myself and if these people vibe with me than great, if not than at least I was true to myself. I laughed a ton and really came out of my shell. Afterwards, and especially the following days, I started to analyze my behaviors and realized that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been presenting myself as the person I want to be. In fact, I think I might have been a bit of an asshole by accident. I can give you a list of criticisms of myself from those nights out, but I won\u2019t. I think I could have done \u201cbetter\u201d. No one has ever told me I was being an asshole, but I DO have trouble forming close relationships and making friends (if everyone around you is an asshole, maybe you\u2019re the asshole). I started to wonder if maybe I come off as an asshole because I\u2019m insecure and try to make up for it, but that can literally be an entirely fabricated possibility by my critical inner dialogue. I have no idea how much of my suspicion is based in reality. I certainly don\u2019t ever want to treat people badly or be insensitive. I\u2019ve been trying to work on doing more listening, asking questions, and being validating of others feelings and experiences. But I can also be very straight forward and blunt, with a dark, sarcastic sense of humor. No one has ever told me these things, this is just a self evaluation. I want to have interactions with others that are genuine and leave them feeling good and uplifted, and I hope doing this is compatible with my personality, which I don\u2019t want to suppress to please others. I have also been told by a friend that I should worry less about offending people, and that the \u201cright\u201d friends will get me. And that if there\u2019s not at least a few people who dislike you, you\u2019re not being yourself. I agree that I\u2019m not always going to please everyone and that\u2019s okay, but I can\u2019t figure out what my \u201cideal self\u201d values. Maybe this is at its roots an identity crisis. I\u2019ve also been told that I both a) Would make more friends if I opened up more/was myself, and b) Open up too quickly and make myself vulnerable to being hurt. This contradictory feedback is all I have to go off of. I understand there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d way to live, but I want to lessen the near constant state of agony my brain is in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Am I being too hard on myself or do I need to make some self improvements, and how to tell the difference/give them appropriate weight?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have anxiety and depression.

Be gentle, don\u2019t say things to yourself you wouldn\u2019t say to a dear friend or a stranger, be kind, don\u2019t beat yourself up, love yourself, etc. That\u2019s all fine and those are absolutely things I need to work on. I am a perfectionist and very critical of myself. On the other hand, I am not delusional enough to think that my problems are entirely caused by things outside of my control - bad childhood, abusive parents, bullying, having shitty toxic friendships and relationships, etc. I\u2019m not interested in blaming my circumstances or those around me. It\u2019s my life and I am taking part in creating my reality, and would like to change myself for the better and make better decisions that lead me to a better quality of life. But when I try to make sense of something in my head, I end up getting extremely frustrated and bounce back and forth between \u201cokay you fucked up and here\u2019s a way to make it better...\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be so hard on yourself, it wasn\u2019t your fault\u201d. \n\nMost recently I have been in a very bad spot mental health wise, and also isolated from family members and friends due to a move. I saw a friend that I hadn\u2019t seen in a few years, as well as some of her newer aquaintences. I was really anxious going into these social interactions because I felt very out of practice, but in the moment I felt great and actually really had a wonderful time. I decided to say fuck it, I was just going to be myself and if these people vibe with me than great, if not than at least I was true to myself. I laughed a ton and really came out of my shell. Afterwards, and especially the following days, I started to analyze my behaviors and realized that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been presenting myself as the person I want to be. In fact, I think I might have been a bit of an asshole by accident. I can give you a list of criticisms of myself from those nights out, but I won\u2019t. I think I could have done \u201cbetter\u201d. No one has ever told me I was being an asshole, but I DO have trouble forming close relationships and making friends (if everyone around you is an asshole, maybe you\u2019re the asshole). I started to wonder if maybe I come off as an asshole because I\u2019m insecure and try to make up for it, but that can literally be an entirely fabricated possibility by my critical inner dialogue. I have no idea how much of my suspicion is based in reality. I certainly don\u2019t ever want to treat people badly or be insensitive. I\u2019ve been trying to work on doing more listening, asking questions, and being validating of others feelings and experiences. But I can also be very straight forward and blunt, with a dark, sarcastic sense of humor. No one has ever told me these things, this is just a self evaluation. I want to have interactions with others that are genuine and leave them feeling good and uplifted, and I hope doing this is compatible with my personality, which I don\u2019t want to suppress to please others. I have also been told by a friend that I should worry less about offending people, and that the \u201cright\u201d friends will get me. And that if there\u2019s not at least a few people who dislike you, you\u2019re not being yourself. I agree that I\u2019m not always going to please everyone and that\u2019s okay, but I can\u2019t figure out what my \u201cideal self\u201d values. Maybe this is at its roots an identity crisis. I\u2019ve also been told that I both a) Would make more friends if I opened up more/was myself, and b) Open up too quickly and make myself vulnerable to being hurt. This contradictory feedback is all I have to go off of. I understand there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d way to live, but I want to lessen the near constant state of agony my brain is in.\n\nTL;DR Am I being too hard on myself or do I need to make some self improvements, and how to tell the difference/give them appropriate weight?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7i1edt", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "How much of this should I take responsibility for?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512596918.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7i1edt", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7i1edt/how_much_of_this_should_i_take_responsibility_for/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512625309.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7i1edt/how_much_of_this_should_i_take_responsibility_for/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Everylemontree", "created_utc": 1512596509.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 27 years old and I had my first anxiety attack this summer after being sick for something like three weeks.

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;**\nI need to just let some shit out, I dont really care if anyone reads it or not but I want to vent. I trigger myself all the time so if you are lonely and get triggered maybe its best not to read about why I am anxious and depressed about it.** &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ive been feeling anxious as hell and I dont have anywhere else to turn. I read some of your posts and just felt like typing something up and letting some emotions out. My life has been moving in a decent direction but my social and more so relationship anxiety has been spiraling out of control. Everything starts to blend together and I start to feel hopeless about the future or ever having any meaningful relationship. Im 25, male, not virgin but not experienced by any means.....I have no idea how to even start a relationship or find someone that is interested in talking. I have tried so much in real life and online. I try not to be &amp;quot;desperate&amp;quot; and look for people I could actually see myself getting along with. I still reach out and try to talk to a lot of people but it just feels impossible at times. No matter what I do I am not sure anything will ever really change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give some history, when I was younger I had a really rough home life. Ended up moving from Florida to Ohio, to run away from someone crazy and dangerous. I dropped out of high school in the process and had so much social anxiety I could barely stand to leave the house. After literally years of being a herimt I started doing better. I took some college classes, got a job, lost some weight. Things seemed to be going alright at first. I made a few friends that drank way too much while I was working, at a casino. I really did a good job getting over my social anxiety, but still longed for a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met a girl I got along with well but ultimately she wasnt interested and I ended up not handling it well. Lost a lot of hope in life, became borderline suicidal and lost those friends in the process. They also showed some other sides that were not very kind. I worked with one of the guys, he was my supervisor. Things were weird.  (2 gay guys and 1 girl, guys dated all 3 were roommates)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, finally as I was getting over all that I met someone new. Someone different. Someone special. She was so nice to me and everything was amazing. She actually wanted to spend time with me, and I couldn&amp;#39;t get enough of her. Being a virgin at this point and 24 I was really interested in what was happening. We cuddled, shared a bed, talked. She said she wasnt ready for sex yet and I was ok with that. She was damaged herself, raped when she was 16 and then went trough some very strange relationship that involved her being something of a sex slave that completed tasks for someone? one of the tasks involved willingly having sex with the person that raped her. She was also at one point engaged to someone in their 50&amp;#39;s, we were similar in age both mid 20&amp;#39;s. I found her past troubling and I was emotionally overwhelmed by it at first but I overcame that because I decided I really liked her for who she was now and I didnt care about the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, the thing is all her relationship and sex experience was intimidating to me. I really felt like I needed a label at this point because I started to be unsure what we had. We work together and I didnt have many friends at work. She had a ton, was comfortable hugging everyone and is a massage therapist on the side as well. She was a very touchy person. And I loved touching and cuddling even if there wasnt going to be sex. We shared our pasts and she said she wished she was a virgin and thought it was fine that I was. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only I wanted to ask her if we were dating because I dont know how any of this works. In high school I was hiding from everyone else until I dropped out. I then lived at home in a lot of social isolation. I suck at making friends in real life, I have some cool online friends I talk to but thats not the same. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She made a few comments here and there when I tried to get an idea of what we had. Sarcastic joking comments that really hurt, like get with a few other woman then get back to me. And at one point she mentioned something about me &amp;quot;not being man enough&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;step up to the plate.&amp;quot; I misread what she meant and did something borderline creepy I guess. She kept telling me how she wanted someone more man, more experienced, willing to step up. She had her past that involved some weird shit. I thought she wanted me to just be more dominant or expressive or something, I felt like I loved her. Well one night during one of these conversations when she was telling me about how she wanted someone to be a man, step up, etc., I thought she wanted me to do something. We worked at the same place, often times we hung out after work. I got it in my head that she wanted me to just be more spontaneous. So one day I tried to think of some plans for us to do after work after we had been texting, I met her by her car as I had before. I tried to plan a fun little night of hitting the gym together and maybe dinner. She had been angry lately so I brought some womens boxing gloves and I was going to try to help her work out some anger. In my head I was being spontaneous and trying to create a fun evening together. Only today, she didnt want me to meet her by her car. I completely made a fool of myself and mis-interpreted whatever message she was trying to get across. Well, now she things im a stalker and im creepy. I completely fucked that up. Long story short, she no longer wants anything with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I am completely in love with her but I did not want to be a stalker so I just went and found something else to do. I drank and cried. I quit my job that was paying $20+ an hour without any prior work experience. I really went off the deep end this time. I wanted to go back to school, I used to always want to go to med school when I was younger. I like to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to piece things together and focus on school. At the start of the semester I was feeling confident. I messaged someone on a dating app, this time really just wanting to go for the first thing that came my way. Well, something came my way. She was ready for a first date of &amp;quot;netflix and chill&amp;quot; and seemed keen on something sexual. She ended up being very ready to have some fun. I faked being way more confident than I usually am because this was just sex, this wasn&amp;#39;t someone I had deep feelings for. I uhh, took the lead and really just focused on doing what she was in to because I didnt even know what I wanted for myself. Well, she had some daddy issues and really wanted someone else to be more doimant, so I was. I gave her a great night with multiple orgasms, I stayed very... hard... and enthusiastic for hours. We played, rested, played, took a nap, etc. for a good while. I never really got off from the whole thing because I was just trying to perform. And I did, it was a confidence boost at first. But this person was far from a soul mate and we did not see eye to eye on much. It ended up being jsut a one night stand but thats probably for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of the school semester I really tried to be positive. I tried to talk to people. I tried to join groups. I tried to be social doing anything I could. Well, I made some new study friends in my science class. I have gotten over most of my social anxiety. I speak up in classes, I try to talk to people and make friends. Im just not very good at it sometimes. Luckily some of my teachers tried to promote study groups for extra credit. So I took it upon myself to try to make that happen, sure for extra credit but also to meet more people. I ended up in a study group with 2 cute girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, one of them is in an open marriage and ive received certain photos of her but I dont think I want to just &amp;quot;sleep&amp;quot; with her because she is cool. Id be attached to her. I have no idea what is going on but we are in some of the same classes again next semester and she is interested in.....something? Man I stress over this, because Im lonely and want real people to connect with, but im also kind of horny and inexperienced. I think im ok with whatever happens here but I just have no idea what to expect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other girl is chill but has a boyfriend. Shes smart and cool to study with as well, I dont really care that she is seeing someone because Im looking for any friends really. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is getting incredibly long but I feel ok typing it up even if you dont read it. So now at the end of the semester, I have a 4.0 GPA and my science teachers are already volunteering to be references for me if I try to go to med school. Im in a decent spot financially. I have my own place and a car. Im about to go on vacation for most of this month 7th-27th. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, it doesnt matter how good anything else goes. I still feel alone. Nothing feels worth going at alone any more. Why should I care about a bright future if im going to be alone in it. And now im having all sorts of anxiety. Mostly just struggling with the social isolation I still feel. When I was home alone and afraid to leave the house that was one thing. Since then I have lost over 100 pounds and changed a fucking lot in my life but I still feel that same social isolation. Im just not sure how much more in my life I can change before giving up. Also on my vacation this month im going to be with my dad&amp;#39;s side of the family. They are mostly very wealth and see drinking as a &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; thing in life and pretty much a right of passage. Its important for me to maintain a good relationship with them all but they are all alcoholics and see drinking as part of life pretty much. Last time I drank I wanted to kill myself. I have scars on my arm from cutting myself. I havnt touched alcohol in months. Not a drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck do I do on this long ass trip. What do I do when I get back. Will I ever meet anyone for something real? Is it to much to ask to just meet a girl and become close friends without sex being important right away?\nGod im a fucking mess.

Or if I even want my place if I find it. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**\nI need to just let some shit out, I dont really care if anyone reads it or not but I want to vent. I trigger myself all the time so if you are lonely and get triggered maybe its best not to read about why I am anxious and depressed about it.** \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIve been feeling anxious as hell and I dont have anywhere else to turn. I read some of your posts and just felt like typing something up and letting some emotions out. My life has been moving in a decent direction but my social and more so relationship anxiety has been spiraling out of control. Everything starts to blend together and I start to feel hopeless about the future or ever having any meaningful relationship. Im 25, male, not virgin but not experienced by any means.....I have no idea how to even start a relationship or find someone that is interested in talking. I have tried so much in real life and online. I try not to be \"desperate\" and look for people I could actually see myself getting along with. I still reach out and try to talk to a lot of people but it just feels impossible at times. No matter what I do I am not sure anything will ever really change. \n\nTo give some history, when I was younger I had a really rough home life. Ended up moving from Florida to Ohio, to run away from someone crazy and dangerous. I dropped out of high school in the process and had so much social anxiety I could barely stand to leave the house. After literally years of being a herimt I started doing better. I took some college classes, got a job, lost some weight. Things seemed to be going alright at first. I made a few friends that drank way too much while I was working, at a casino. I really did a good job getting over my social anxiety, but still longed for a relationship. \n\nI met a girl I got along with well but ultimately she wasnt interested and I ended up not handling it well. Lost a lot of hope in life, became borderline suicidal and lost those friends in the process. They also showed some other sides that were not very kind. I worked with one of the guys, he was my supervisor. Things were weird.  (2 gay guys and 1 girl, guys dated all 3 were roommates)\n\nWell, finally as I was getting over all that I met someone new. Someone different. Someone special. She was so nice to me and everything was amazing. She actually wanted to spend time with me, and I couldn't get enough of her. Being a virgin at this point and 24 I was really interested in what was happening. We cuddled, shared a bed, talked. She said she wasnt ready for sex yet and I was ok with that. She was damaged herself, raped when she was 16 and then went trough some very strange relationship that involved her being something of a sex slave that completed tasks for someone? one of the tasks involved willingly having sex with the person that raped her. She was also at one point engaged to someone in their 50's, we were similar in age both mid 20's. I found her past troubling and I was emotionally overwhelmed by it at first but I overcame that because I decided I really liked her for who she was now and I didnt care about the past.\n\nWell, the thing is all her relationship and sex experience was intimidating to me. I really felt like I needed a label at this point because I started to be unsure what we had. We work together and I didnt have many friends at work. She had a ton, was comfortable hugging everyone and is a massage therapist on the side as well. She was a very touchy person. And I loved touching and cuddling even if there wasnt going to be sex. We shared our pasts and she said she wished she was a virgin and thought it was fine that I was. Cool.\n\nOnly I wanted to ask her if we were dating because I dont know how any of this works. In high school I was hiding from everyone else until I dropped out. I then lived at home in a lot of social isolation. I suck at making friends in real life, I have some cool online friends I talk to but thats not the same. \n\nShe made a few comments here and there when I tried to get an idea of what we had. Sarcastic joking comments that really hurt, like get with a few other woman then get back to me. And at one point she mentioned something about me \"not being man enough\" to \"step up to the plate.\" I misread what she meant and did something borderline creepy I guess. She kept telling me how she wanted someone more man, more experienced, willing to step up. She had her past that involved some weird shit. I thought she wanted me to just be more dominant or expressive or something, I felt like I loved her. Well one night during one of these conversations when she was telling me about how she wanted someone to be a man, step up, etc., I thought she wanted me to do something. We worked at the same place, often times we hung out after work. I got it in my head that she wanted me to just be more spontaneous. So one day I tried to think of some plans for us to do after work after we had been texting, I met her by her car as I had before. I tried to plan a fun little night of hitting the gym together and maybe dinner. She had been angry lately so I brought some womens boxing gloves and I was going to try to help her work out some anger. In my head I was being spontaneous and trying to create a fun evening together. Only today, she didnt want me to meet her by her car. I completely made a fool of myself and mis-interpreted whatever message she was trying to get across. Well, now she things im a stalker and im creepy. I completely fucked that up. Long story short, she no longer wants anything with me.\n\nAt this point I am completely in love with her but I did not want to be a stalker so I just went and found something else to do. I drank and cried. I quit my job that was paying $20+ an hour without any prior work experience. I really went off the deep end this time. I wanted to go back to school, I used to always want to go to med school when I was younger. I like to learn.\n\nI tried to piece things together and focus on school. At the start of the semester I was feeling confident. I messaged someone on a dating app, this time really just wanting to go for the first thing that came my way. Well, something came my way. She was ready for a first date of \"netflix and chill\" and seemed keen on something sexual. She ended up being very ready to have some fun. I faked being way more confident than I usually am because this was just sex, this wasn't someone I had deep feelings for. I uhh, took the lead and really just focused on doing what she was in to because I didnt even know what I wanted for myself. Well, she had some daddy issues and really wanted someone else to be more doimant, so I was. I gave her a great night with multiple orgasms, I stayed very... hard... and enthusiastic for hours. We played, rested, played, took a nap, etc. for a good while. I never really got off from the whole thing because I was just trying to perform. And I did, it was a confidence boost at first. But this person was far from a soul mate and we did not see eye to eye on much. It ended up being jsut a one night stand but thats probably for the best.\n\nThe rest of the school semester I really tried to be positive. I tried to talk to people. I tried to join groups. I tried to be social doing anything I could. Well, I made some new study friends in my science class. I have gotten over most of my social anxiety. I speak up in classes, I try to talk to people and make friends. Im just not very good at it sometimes. Luckily some of my teachers tried to promote study groups for extra credit. So I took it upon myself to try to make that happen, sure for extra credit but also to meet more people. I ended up in a study group with 2 cute girls.\n\nWell, one of them is in an open marriage and ive received certain photos of her but I dont think I want to just \"sleep\" with her because she is cool. Id be attached to her. I have no idea what is going on but we are in some of the same classes again next semester and she is interested in.....something? Man I stress over this, because Im lonely and want real people to connect with, but im also kind of horny and inexperienced. I think im ok with whatever happens here but I just have no idea what to expect. \n\nOther girl is chill but has a boyfriend. Shes smart and cool to study with as well, I dont really care that she is seeing someone because Im looking for any friends really. \n\nThis is getting incredibly long but I feel ok typing it up even if you dont read it. So now at the end of the semester, I have a 4.0 GPA and my science teachers are already volunteering to be references for me if I try to go to med school. Im in a decent spot financially. I have my own place and a car. Im about to go on vacation for most of this month 7th-27th. \n\nThe problem is, it doesnt matter how good anything else goes. I still feel alone. Nothing feels worth going at alone any more. Why should I care about a bright future if im going to be alone in it. And now im having all sorts of anxiety. Mostly just struggling with the social isolation I still feel. When I was home alone and afraid to leave the house that was one thing. Since then I have lost over 100 pounds and changed a fucking lot in my life but I still feel that same social isolation. Im just not sure how much more in my life I can change before giving up. Also on my vacation this month im going to be with my dad's side of the family. They are mostly very wealth and see drinking as a \"fine\" thing in life and pretty much a right of passage. Its important for me to maintain a good relationship with them all but they are all alcoholics and see drinking as part of life pretty much. Last time I drank I wanted to kill myself. I have scars on my arm from cutting myself. I havnt touched alcohol in months. Not a drop.\n\nWhat the fuck do I do on this long ass trip. What do I do when I get back. Will I ever meet anyone for something real? Is it to much to ask to just meet a girl and become close friends without sex being important right away?\nGod im a fucking mess.

This may be a doozy. So, I&amp;#39;ve suffered from GAD for years, dysthymia, and Tourette&amp;#39;s Syndrome. No, my Tourette&amp;#39;s isn&amp;#39;t the kind where you swear or yell out loud, it&amp;#39;s more things like hard blinking, nose scrunching, sniffling, throat noises, expelling air out of the lungs forcibly, etc. When I was younger they were just called &amp;#39;nervous tics&amp;#39; and well, gotta live with them. The only reason I bring this up is because having anxiety, it makes the tics much worse. So much so that it&amp;#39;s physically exhausting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to anxiety. I&amp;#39;ve always had it. Constant worry, fear, mild OCD behavior, etc. I&amp;#39;ve had it since I can remember, and after I was diagnosed I tried a multitude of medications from prozac, effexor, busiprone, prozac, seroquel, trazodone...you name it. With anxiety, I&amp;#39;ve always had medication anxiety and never really stuck with anything. I was able to smoke (marijuana) to control the anxiety so I didn&amp;#39;t think I needed anything. When I turned 20, smoking gave me horrible heart palpitations, worsened my anxiety, all that jazz. I had to quit, and then turned to alcohol. Few years later I can&amp;#39;t drink anymore to cope, and I decide to get sober. Everything is fine and well for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the last few years. I moved 12 hours away from home, and started making a new life out here. The first step of my developing panic disorder started with driving on the highway. I used to travel the country (US) by myself, with friends, etc while driving and actually saw it as a stress reliever. I loved getting behind the wheel and exploring. Then it all changed. The second I start on the on ramp, I got tunnel vision, rapid breathing, feeling like I&amp;#39;m choking, all that.  Obviously that&amp;#39;s not safe so I decided hey, I&amp;#39;ll just take the back way. It may take a little longer but that&amp;#39;s fine with me. Eventually, I start panicking at any stop light, and there was one specific spot during my drive to campus where I&amp;#39;d slip into a panic attack and I DREADED going. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, I started having panic attacks in class. Of course the flight or fight response kicked it, and I&amp;#39;d flee. Eventually it got to the point where even before the class started, I&amp;#39;d slip into a panic attack and leave class and just go sit in my car. This happened nearly every day and I eventually changed my major (from animal biology to psychology, ironically) just so I could take online only classes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I couldn&amp;#39;t drive at all. I tried driving to the grocery store, backing out of my driveway and pulling back in about 5 times before realizing that I just...couldn&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s spiraled out of control to the point where I can&amp;#39;t drive anywhere, go into a store, wait in the check-out line, ride in an elevator, stand on an escalator, and sometimes even just RIDE in a car without having a panic attack. I&amp;#39;ve tried meditating, mindfulness, essential oils, and I still can&amp;#39;t bring myself to drive or go to the store. I used to LOVE shopping and would jump at the opportunity to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this is really cathartic to get out, but I just wanted to say that I finally made an appointment with a doctor and I see her in two weeks. It feels great to finally get on the path to normalcy. I think I want to start at square one with SSRI&amp;#39;s and start trying what I never stuck to when I started being medicated 12+ years ago. My last PCP did give me a xanax script which DOES help, but I don&amp;#39;t want to rely on them, and I want a cure instead of a band-aid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has anyone gone through panic disorder, similar symptoms or not, and have you found relief?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What medications have worked the most for you?

I\u2019ll give a quick backstory even though it has nothing to do with my question. I\u2019m currently 18 years old, and have been suffering from pretty severe depression and anxiety for the past 8 years. About a month ago, I was brought into a crisis Center for suicide assessment, and when I left they set me up with a case manager at my schools health department, who then got me into my first ever therapy sessions. From a young age I\u2019ve always been against taking medications, but after my first ever meeting with a psychiatrist about 4 days ago, I thought I\u2019d be willing to give it a shot. She recommended a couple of different medications I could take (only one I can remember is Xanax but I\u2019m gonna stay away from that), but I\u2019m going in tomorrow to get a prescription for whichever one I choose. I\u2019m currently a freshman in college and a new member of a fraternity, and while I don\u2019t drink too much, I usually go to a party once or twice a week. I was just curious if there are any anxiety medications available that it is not dangerous to drink with? Obviously I know about the dangers of drinking and Xanax, but I\u2019m looking for alternative that would allow me to party every once in a while. Lastly, just curious if any of these medications have side effects with adderall (as I am prescribed), or painkillers (which I\u2019m currently on as a result of a leg surgery about a week back).

I&amp;#39;ll try to make this as quick as possible, but I need some advice. So to give you some background, I am 20 years old and have really bad anxiety. I have gotten a lot better as I&amp;#39;ve gotten older but there are certain situations I find myself in where I am extremely uncomfortable. Over the years, I have come out of my shell a lot and let you me tell you, I used to be vet shy and quiet. I was in a  phase where I wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable with myself and did not really know who I was as person. Years of being the quiet girl, I have (for the most part) gained the confidence I have struggled with for a long time. Of course, I still am not that friend who is the life of the party, the girl who is comfortable with the attention on her, but I have learned how to better handle awkward situations. Now that I am in college and have gotten through highschool (the worst four years, well three of my life), I have grown to become comfortable with who I am. Most importantly, I have learned to stand up for myself. Each day is a new learning experience, as I sometimes find myself terrified to make a doctors appointment, order food, pump gas, and even go out into my boyfriends kitchen to get water. Sometimes I feel like I&amp;#39;m impeding everyone around me. Sometimes, I tell myself I&amp;#39;m being a pain because I want to take a shower at my boyfriends house but I&amp;#39;m afraid it will upset them because I always take showers there. Sometimes I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ll come across selfish for not wanting to go anywhere on my boyfriends days off. Sometimes I worry that I come across rude when I really just said how I felt. Some days are harder than others, but I still get through them and I try not to let my anxiety get the best of me.\nHowever, one thing I have always struggled with is; helping my family and caring for them when they are sick. More specifically, my boyfriends mom. She is definitely the type of person that does not want your help and tries to do everything on her own. However at the same time, she is completely dependent on you and your advice. Having multiple surgeries in the past for her incurable bone disease, she&amp;#39;s a trooper no doubt. Very recently, as in today, she has had another major surgery to remove bone spurs from her neck. I know in the next few days, me and my boyfriend will be heading over to help her out. When it comes to his mom, my boyfriend is the sweetest, most attentive person in the whole world. He knows exactly how to read her without her ever having to say anything and he knows exactly how to deal with her moods, especially when she is sick. After such a major surgery, I am nervous to go see her. I have always been awkward when it comes to knowing what to do. It&amp;#39;s like my body freezes and I don&amp;#39;t have the confidence to help, because I feel like I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong. His mom is very strong willed and very intimidating in many aspects. I have always had a hard time saying what&amp;#39;s on my mind around her. It&amp;#39;s just I have never had family like her before, so it&amp;#39;s new for me. She&amp;#39;s just a lot to take. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, she is so fun and crazy, but sometimes, I just don&amp;#39;t know how to respond to her. I remember I drove her in to the city for her monthly infusion and she was an emotional mess afterwards. I have a hard time opening up to people as it is, so for me, it&amp;#39;s a really uncomfortable situation to be in. I kind of cringe thinking about it because I&amp;#39;m. so. awkward. I remember my boyfriend being called into her room because she wanted him. As I was waiting in the waiting room, I felt so ashamed and embarrassed.. and kind of useless because I know I would not have been able to console her in the ways he did. Of course he is her son and they share a special bond, but even with my own mother or grandmother, I could never do that. My boyfriend always says to me, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s just how you are and that&amp;#39;s okay&amp;quot;, but I just wish I could do more, be more. I wish I wasn&amp;#39;t so awkward. I have never had to deal with someone like her and care for someone in the ways my boyfriend cares for her and it really scares me. I know it might sound selfish, but I&amp;#39;m really nervous to go see her because I&amp;#39;m so awkward and I just feel so uncomfortable. I&amp;#39;m a lot like my grandfather, in the sense I am more of the type to listen than to talk, or sit back and watch than be the one consoling. It&amp;#39;s takes a lot for me. I&amp;#39;ve never had it with my own parents, so it&amp;#39;s especially hard with my boyfriends. After being together a year and a half, I have come a long way and I&amp;#39;ve gotten comfortable around his family, but I&amp;#39;m still nervous. I&amp;#39;m trying not to think about it too much, but it&amp;#39;s all&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about. The last thing I want to do is dissapoint my boyfriend because I can&amp;#39;t even put myself together enough for his mom who he cares so much about. I would never ever not go to visit her and do that to him, but I have always been so uncomfortable with my own emotions and other people&amp;#39;s emotions. I&amp;#39;ve become comfortable enough around my boyfriend that I hold him, console him and wipe away his tears when he needs it, but for a long time I had a very difficult time. For a while it made me uncomfortable, but now I know how to handle his emotions. I hope there others out there who understand. I guess this wasn&amp;#39;t very short after all. My question is, what can I do to get out of my comfort zone? How can I become comfortable around others and deal with their emotions? I have never been that person to give great advice or console someone. Most times, I feel like I make it worse by being quiet because I never know what to say. I so badly want to help.

I\u2019ve had probably the strangest experience with my anxiety this afternoon. Long story short, I work 8-5, (ish,) at a company that I truly love, doing packaging work. I have a wonderful wife, and I love where I live. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m not a morning person, given I\u2019ve pretty much always worked night shifts in various restaurant kitchens. This causes me mild anxiety as far as going to sleep early enough at night. Anyway, that\u2019s beside the point. \n\n  I arrive at work in a good mood, I\u2019m taking care of some side stuff that I haven\u2019t been able to in awhile because I had a down day.

This was large in part due to having some health issues (what I&amp;#39;ve been told was probably costochondritis or fibro) which made my body so miserable. After about 4 months of dealing with all that, I got health insurance and I was put on zoloft. It gave me panic attacks for days and stomach cramps that did not go away. I was lethargic and unable to function so I stopped taking it (after a visit to the ER and several docs suggested I stop). I was due to have a counseling session with the only person that was available, but I read her Yelp reviews and they were pretty terrible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to go anyway but I ended up crashing my car the day before and was unable to spend the money on it. I was actually feeling okay and in control finally...up until the evening I crashed the car. Again, a few days later I was okay but I woke up to my dog having a swollen face and severe hives all over her body. This sent me into a panic and I took her to the vet. They said it was likely an allergic reaction (to what I don&amp;#39;t know because she was like that when we got up in the morning from her crate) but if it happens again (she did have hives and some mild vomiting a few months ago) they might look into a type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;m constantly worried that every day I&amp;#39;m going to wake up and find her sick again or worse.

I have general anxiety and started getting panic attacks in college, usually exacerbated by lack of sleep and caffeine. They&amp;#39;re mostly under control, but my mental health took a sharp nosedive a few weeks ago, with no particular trigger that I could tell, and I figured part of it at least was SAD and the sunshine of Florida would help. I guess I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, getting into the park was much more of a hassle than anticipated, and we almost missed our first fastpass time, and that had me extremely on edge. (I am a semi-regular at DisneyLAND but this is my first time in Florida). We got through the rest of our fastpass rides without incident though, and I was feeling OK. But the park was crazy with cheerleaders and their families, so waits outside of fastpasses were hours, at least. I started having trouble breathing mid-way through the line to Under the Sea, but I figured that was the intensity of the cheer moms on each side of me &amp;amp; the smell of their cheez-its. That wait was only 20 minutes but it felt like hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to just wait it out for the other rides we like, but my feet had really started to hurt, and I was craving the bed of our AirBnB and maybe some good (and cheaper) food. I hadn&amp;#39;t been sleeping well at all. I felt the panic low key rising up under my skin. But I tried to suck it up and we got in line for Jungle Cruise. It was an 80 minute wait to the ride. It was hot. The line was tight and cramped. My throat closed up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I managed to stammer out something and my BF asked if i wanted to leave. My innate need to please people fought with the intensity of my chest tightening for a minute before I nodded, terrified at the thought of people coming up behind us and trapping us in this line for well over an hour. We left the line, and soon after, the park. I feel horrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My BF was great about it, and tries to understand, but he&amp;#39;s totally neurotypical and just can&amp;#39;t. I do have clonopin for emergencies, but I get such a limited prescription that I try not to overuse it. Part of my anxieties tie into fear of missing out, and it kills me that I couldn&amp;#39;t muster up the courage just to wait for my favorites we couldn&amp;#39;t get passes to, like Haunted Mansion. I feel like I ruined things. We were still at the park for almost 8 hours so I know logically that&amp;#39;s not true, but it&amp;#39;s been hard to manage almost everything about this trip, even the low key relaxing stuff, as I get less and less sleep worrying about it. It&amp;#39;s just not the vacation I dreamed of, thanks to my anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: anxiety cuts short a trip to Disneyworld my bf and I have been looking forward to for months. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey all, new poster, just looking for some support from people who understand. \n\nI'm currently in Florida with my boyfriend of ~1 year, and while there have been lots of great moments, I am really bummed about how things are turning out thanks to my brain. I have general anxiety and started getting panic attacks in college, usually exacerbated by lack of sleep and caffeine. They're mostly under control, but my mental health took a sharp nosedive a few weeks ago, with no particular trigger that I could tell, and I figured part of it at least was SAD and the sunshine of Florida would help. I guess I was wrong.\n\nFirst off, getting into the park was much more of a hassle than anticipated, and we almost missed our first fastpass time, and that had me extremely on edge. (I am a semi-regular at DisneyLAND but this is my first time in Florida). We got through the rest of our fastpass rides without incident though, and I was feeling OK. But the park was crazy with cheerleaders and their families, so waits outside of fastpasses were hours, at least. I started having trouble breathing mid-way through the line to Under the Sea, but I figured that was the intensity of the cheer moms on each side of me &amp; the smell of their cheez-its. That wait was only 20 minutes but it felt like hours. \n\nWe decided to just wait it out for the other rides we like, but my feet had really started to hurt, and I was craving the bed of our AirBnB and maybe some good (and cheaper) food. I hadn't been sleeping well at all. I felt the panic low key rising up under my skin. But I tried to suck it up and we got in line for Jungle Cruise. It was an 80 minute wait to the ride. It was hot. The line was tight and cramped. My throat closed up. \n\nI managed to stammer out something and my BF asked if i wanted to leave. My innate need to please people fought with the intensity of my chest tightening for a minute before I nodded, terrified at the thought of people coming up behind us and trapping us in this line for well over an hour. We left the line, and soon after, the park. I feel horrible.\n\nMy BF was great about it, and tries to understand, but he's totally neurotypical and just can't. I do have clonopin for emergencies, but I get such a limited prescription that I try not to overuse it. Part of my anxieties tie into fear of missing out, and it kills me that I couldn't muster up the courage just to wait for my favorites we couldn't get passes to, like Haunted Mansion. I feel like I ruined things. We were still at the park for almost 8 hours so I know logically that's not true, but it's been hard to manage almost everything about this trip, even the low key relaxing stuff, as I get less and less sleep worrying about it. It's just not the vacation I dreamed of, thanks to my anxiety. \n\nTL;DR: anxiety cuts short a trip to Disneyworld my bf and I have been looking forward to for months.

A little background first: this all started about a month ago when I was driving on the freeway back to work from a workout when my blood sugar dropped, which scared me to the point of causing me to have a full blown panic attack. I immediately pulled onto the shoulder and called 911. From there, they took me to the hospital and determined that I had an &amp;quot;anxiety episode.&amp;quot; I figured I just needed to eat more carbs to prevent low blood sugar and I could move on with my life. I was fully prepared to put the whole thing behind me and leave it in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was until I tried driving again. My husband and I carpool to work and although he is usually the main driver, I sometimes drive to make sure my skills are still up to speed. A few days later, I was driving both of us to work (we work in the same area) and I started realizing that I was having an adverse reaction: there was a weird pressure in my head, a knot in my throat, my heart started beating faster, just total nervousness. Fast forward to a different day, I was feeling pretty good, so I had the car and was running errands during lunchtime. I was doing okay on my way to the first few stores, but then on my way back to work I had this sense that I needed to use the restroom. No big deal right? I&amp;#39;m a grown woman and can hold it until I get back to my office... but then somehow this became an emergency and it triggered another panic attack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Driving is now extremely stressful and all of the confidence that I had in my ability to drive is now gone. I feel like every time I get into a driver&amp;#39;s seat, I&amp;#39;m going to have a panic attack. I&amp;#39;m trying to get back into driving slowly, with my hubby in the passenger seat, only taking the streets instead of freeways, but just sitting in front of a steering wheel brings my anxiety level up to a 5 out of 10. I nearly had another panic attack yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal, since my hubby is currently looking for another job and if he finds one in a different area of town, I may need to drive myself to and from work. He is considering not taking a new job because of this, but I know he is sick of his current job and I want him to be happy. I don&amp;#39;t want my driving anxiety to get in the way of his progress. I want to drive the way I used to, with full confidence and not a single worry of a panic attack. Any advice out there?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I need help overcoming my anxiety while driving. A little background first: this all started about a month ago when I was driving on the freeway back to work from a workout when my blood sugar dropped, which scared me to the point of causing me to have a full blown panic attack. I immediately pulled onto the shoulder and called 911. From there, they took me to the hospital and determined that I had an \"anxiety episode.\" I figured I just needed to eat more carbs to prevent low blood sugar and I could move on with my life. I was fully prepared to put the whole thing behind me and leave it in the past.\n\nThat was until I tried driving again. My husband and I carpool to work and although he is usually the main driver, I sometimes drive to make sure my skills are still up to speed. A few days later, I was driving both of us to work (we work in the same area) and I started realizing that I was having an adverse reaction: there was a weird pressure in my head, a knot in my throat, my heart started beating faster, just total nervousness. Fast forward to a different day, I was feeling pretty good, so I had the car and was running errands during lunchtime. I was doing okay on my way to the first few stores, but then on my way back to work I had this sense that I needed to use the restroom. No big deal right? I'm a grown woman and can hold it until I get back to my office... but then somehow this became an emergency and it triggered another panic attack. \n\nDriving is now extremely stressful and all of the confidence that I had in my ability to drive is now gone. I feel like every time I get into a driver's seat, I'm going to have a panic attack. I'm trying to get back into driving slowly, with my hubby in the passenger seat, only taking the streets instead of freeways, but just sitting in front of a steering wheel brings my anxiety level up to a 5 out of 10. I nearly had another panic attack yesterday.\n\nThis is a big deal, since my hubby is currently looking for another job and if he finds one in a different area of town, I may need to drive myself to and from work. He is considering not taking a new job because of this, but I know he is sick of his current job and I want him to be happy. I don't want my driving anxiety to get in the way of his progress. I want to drive the way I used to, with full confidence and not a single worry of a panic attack.

I arrived there at 9:45. I had to leave for a 4-hour trip to pick up something I was buying from Craigslist and I had to be there before 3:00 pm because the guy was leaving town for a week when he got off work. So basically, I had to be out of her office by 11:00 am or I wouldn\u2019t make it. It was already a very stressful situation, but I figured this would be fine because her appointments are only 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10:15 rolled around and I asked the receptionist what was going on and she said she must be running late, so I sat back down. It was 10:30 and I asked the receptionist if she could please check to see what was going on because I needed to leave. She told me I would get a bill in the mail if I left, even though I already paid the co-pay and I was scared of that, so I didn\u2019t leave. She called my doctor again and then I saw 3 receptionists whispering about me and looking over at me. Great. Like I need any more anxiety this morning. So I was already pretty pissed off and anxious, and this was making it 1000x worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was 10:45 before I got in and I was shaking and fidgeting and looking around nervously and told Dr. B what was going on. She dismissed me and said \u201care you feeling depressed because you seem pretty depressed and anxious.\u201d I just wanted to scream because I had been feeling a lot better in the past weeks. I told her calmly that this anxiety was basically caused by her and her office and she didn\u2019t believe me. Dr. B asked me why I hadn\u2019t been in the office for 2 months and I told her it was because her staff never answers the phone. She said that was \u201chard to believe\u201d even after I showed her proof that I called and no one answered 7 times in the last 2 months. It was 11:00 and I told her I needed to leave, but she told me to sit down and listen to her. In retrospect, I could\u2019ve (and should\u2019ve) just left right then, but I was scared so I sat back down.

Initially (a year ago), Dr. R recommended that I see a psychiatrist in the practice, Dr. S, but she wasn\u2019t accepting new patients, so I had to see Dr. B in the meantime.

I'm extremely nervous to start taking it, so I've just been taking a half of a clonzepam in the morning so I don't get panic attacks (and the other half if I start to feel one coming on.) I don't know what to do. My psychiatrist appointment isn't until the end of January, and then that's just an assessment... Should I just try the Paxil until then? I'm so scared it will give me another panic attack and send me to the hospital", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Medication", "id": "7hsw3h", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "medication anxiety", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "medsflair", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hsw3h", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7hsw3h/medication_anxiety/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512537535.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7hsw3h/medication_anxiety/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "naturalbornvirgo", "created_utc": 1512508735.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to be having trouble defining and elaborating on what seems to occur with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially I experience a lovely trifecta of anxiety, depression and ptsd to cap it all off.

We were going to see lots of different theatre around the city. And also get a tour around the large &amp;quot;Stadsteatern&amp;quot; (The City Theatre)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the day of the tour (second or third day I think) we had some time to wander and explore the city before the tour started. We all went out in various groups. I went with my two best friends from my class. We wandered around a bit in a mall and had a pretty good time until the time for the tour started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, Stockholm is a pretty big city. One of the largest I&amp;#39;ve been to. In general, large cities are pretty overwhelming to me. Even the much smaller, but still pretty big city of Oslo can tire me out in just a few hours. But I was doing fine until now, because of my own well developed coping mechanisms and the fact that we were staying in the old town of Stockholm, which is a more quiet part of the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, one of the things I hate the most, and causes me the most stress, is being late. If I have to go somewhere by train, I would rather arrive two hours early and wait, than take a train that takes me close to my destination five minutes before I&amp;#39;m supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there we were in the middle of Stockholm. A very large city. And we were already past the time I would have liked to be present before the tour started, because my friends insisted that it would be fine, so I counted on them to get us there on time.(&lt;em&gt;Quick sidenote: I don&amp;#39;t blame my friends for the meltdown&lt;/em&gt;) We then realised that we had no Idea where to go to get back to the theatre. We walked for minutes looking for it. We even asked (what we assumed to be) a local guy about where it was. Either he gave us shit directions, or he actually didn&amp;#39;t know where it was, because his directions ended up leading us more astray. Meanwhile I was getting more and more stressed from the whole situation. The combination of the stress of being late, the sensory overload of being in such a large city and the frustration of being lost had me near-panicking. My coping mechanisms where starting to fail. My friends did their best to calm me down, I think that&amp;#39;s much of the reason I didn&amp;#39;t burst right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we did find our way back. I was a bit calmer, but still on the edge. When we came into the theatre, the rest of the class and the tour guide were waiting for us. One of my other classmates turned to face me as I entered the room. I could tell on his face he was about to make a joke about us being late. Under normal circumstances I like joking with him, but right now I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it. He had barely opened his mouth and started to say something, when I half-yelled at him; &amp;quot;DON&amp;#39;T!!! DON&amp;#39;T SAY ANYTHING!!! I CAN&amp;#39;T HANDLE IT RIGHT NOW!!!&amp;quot; And halfway through saying all that, I broke down, fell to my knees and started crying. (&lt;em&gt;Sidenote: I don&amp;#39;t blame him either&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the teachers sat me down in a nearby chair and after a while, I had calmed down, and we could all go on the tour of the theatre. I was really happy the tour guide was kind enough to wait. The tour was pretty sweet too! That theatre has the roomiest elevator I&amp;#39;ve ever seen! You could fit a small house in there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Stockholm-Meltdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nNext november it was time for another study trip to Stockholm. On the day of this meltdown, we were going out to a theatre on the outskirts of town, to see (if my memory serves me correctly) The stand-up show &amp;quot;Jag \u00e4r Gud&amp;quot; (I am God) by swedish comedian Marika Carlsson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On this day we also had a lot of time earlier in the day to explore the city. So me and a bunch of friends went with a ferry over to an aquarium. It was a very nice time. One of my friends (who was also with me during previous meltdown) took a creepy polaroid selfie where her face is lit up but everything around her is creepy and dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once we were done in the aquarium, the others wanted to take the ferry back to the place we were staying. I thought that to be a waste of time, since we would then have to take the same ferry back again to go see the show, and I would rather just wait on this side. But they said that there would be time enough, so I went with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now despite the day in general being nice until then, I was suffering from a bad attack of thinking my friends didn&amp;#39;t really like me. I get these from time to time. Normally I know those thoughts aren&amp;#39;t true, but still, I can&amp;#39;t help it. They come back time and time again. So the general feel of the day for me wasn&amp;#39;t really good. One of the contributers to this meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So once we were gonna take the ferry back again again, I was starting to stress from worrying about being too late again. There wasn&amp;#39;t really anything to worry about, we were on time and then some, but that&amp;#39;s how much I worry about and hate being late. Combined with the already unpleasant feeling inside me, it was bringing me right on the edge of breaking once again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once we got off the ferry I got seperated a bit from the others. This only added to my near-panick. I think I was almost hyper-ventilating by now. Then as I was trying to catch up to them, the ferry I had just stepped of made a loud honk. And that was the breaking point. It was so unexpected and loud that I screamed out loud in panick and sat down next to a tree. I was hyperventilating even worse now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some swedish woman came and sat down by me and helped me calm down. She just talked to me a bit and gave me a drink of water. After I was calm enough to function again, she said goodbye, went away, and I never saw her again, but I am eternally gratefull for her just taking the time to help me calm down. I got to the show on time. It was pretty funny!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s the story of my meltdowns in Stockholm. I&amp;#39;m writing it here just because I needed to get the story out and thought that some people here would understand and possibly have gone through similar experiences. And if that unknow swedish woman ever reads this: &lt;em&gt;Takk s\u00e5 mye!

And also get a tour around the large \"Stadsteatern\" (The City Theatre)\n\nOn the day of the tour (second or third day I think) we had some time to wander and explore the city before the tour started. We all went out in various groups. I went with my two best friends from my class. We wandered around a bit in a mall and had a pretty good time until the time for the tour started.\n\nNow, Stockholm is a pretty big city. One of the largest I've been to. In general, large cities are pretty overwhelming to me. Even the much smaller, but still pretty big city of Oslo can tire me out in just a few hours. But I was doing fine until now, because of my own well developed coping mechanisms and the fact that we were staying in the old town of Stockholm, which is a more quiet part of the city.\n\nIn addition, one of the things I hate the most, and causes me the most stress, is being late. If I have to go somewhere by train, I would rather arrive two hours early and wait, than take a train that takes me close to my destination five minutes before I'm supposed to be there.\n\nSo there we were in the middle of Stockholm. A very large city. And we were already past the time I would have liked to be present before the tour started, because my friends insisted that it would be fine, so I counted on them to get us there on time.(*Quick sidenote: I don't blame my friends for the meltdown*) We then realised that we had no Idea where to go to get back to the theatre. We walked for minutes looking for it. We even asked (what we assumed to be) a local guy about where it was. Either he gave us shit directions, or he actually didn't know where it was, because his directions ended up leading us more astray. Meanwhile I was getting more and more stressed from the whole situation. The combination of the stress of being late, the sensory overload of being in such a large city and the frustration of being lost had me near-panicking. My coping mechanisms where starting to fail. My friends did their best to calm me down, I think that's much of the reason I didn't burst right away.\n\nEventually, we did find our way back. I was a bit calmer, but still on the edge. When we came into the theatre, the rest of the class and the tour guide were waiting for us. One of my other classmates turned to face me as I entered the room. I could tell on his face he was about to make a joke about us being late. Under normal circumstances I like joking with him, but right now I couldn't handle it. He had barely opened his mouth and started to say something, when I half-yelled at him; \"DON'T!!! DON'T SAY ANYTHING!!! I CAN'T HANDLE IT RIGHT NOW!!!\" And halfway through saying all that, I broke down, fell to my knees and started crying. (*Sidenote: I don't blame him either*)\n\nOne of the teachers sat me down in a nearby chair and after a while, I had calmed down, and we could all go on the tour of the theatre. I was really happy the tour guide was kind enough to wait. The tour was pretty sweet too! That theatre has the roomiest elevator I've ever seen! You could fit a small house in there!\n\n**Second Stockholm-Meltdown**  \nNext november it was time for another study trip to Stockholm. On the day of this meltdown, we were going out to a theatre on the outskirts of town, to see (if my memory serves me correctly) The stand-up show \"Jag \u00e4r Gud\" (I am God) by swedish comedian Marika Carlsson.\n\nOn this day we also had a lot of time earlier in the day to explore the city. So me and a bunch of friends went with a ferry over to an aquarium. It was a very nice time. One of my friends (who was also with me during previous meltdown) took a creepy polaroid selfie where her face is lit up but everything around her is creepy and dark.\n\nAnyway, once we were done in the aquarium, the others wanted to take the ferry back to the place we were staying. I thought that to be a waste of time, since we would then have to take the same ferry back again to go see the show, and I would rather just wait on this side. But they said that there would be time enough, so I went with them.\n\nNow despite the day in general being nice until then, I was suffering from a bad attack of thinking my friends didn't really like me. I get these from time to time. Normally I know those thoughts aren't true, but still, I can't help it. They come back time and time again. So the general feel of the day for me wasn't really good. One of the contributers to this meltdown.\n\nSo once we were gonna take the ferry back again again, I was starting to stress from worrying about being too late again. There wasn't really anything to worry about, we were on time and then some, but that's how much I worry about and hate being late. Combined with the already unpleasant feeling inside me, it was bringing me right on the edge of breaking once again.\n\nOnce we got off the ferry I got seperated a bit from the others. This only added to my near-panick. I think I was almost hyper-ventilating by now. Then as I was trying to catch up to them, the ferry I had just stepped of made a loud honk. And that was the breaking point. It was so unexpected and loud that I screamed out loud in panick and sat down next to a tree. I was hyperventilating even worse now.\n\nSome swedish woman came and sat down by me and helped me calm down. She just talked to me a bit and gave me a drink of water. After I was calm enough to function again, she said goodbye, went away, and I never saw her again, but I am eternally gratefull for her just taking the time to help me calm down. I got to the show on time. It was pretty funny!\n\nAnyway, that's the story of my meltdowns in Stockholm. I'm writing it here just because I needed to get the story out and thought that some people here would understand and possibly have gone through similar experiences. And if that unknow swedish woman ever reads this: *Takk s\u00e5 mye!

From as early an age as I can recall, I have lived in pretty much a constant state of fear. Every driving trip with the family, I was always afraid that we would crash. Every time I was anywhere except in my room at home, I was always scanning around looking for people that I thought were out to get me. As I got older and into high school, I felt like everyone was watching every move I made. It didn&amp;#39;t help that people I had never met were greeting me by name on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school, there were no more than 6 people I could call friends, but 3 of them were more like acquaintances. I abandoned who I considered to be my best friend after they tried to take advantage of me in junior year. It was in my sophomore year that the acquaintances introduced me to various drugs, which I kept doing until my senior year when I just wasn&amp;#39;t into them anymore. The drugs never really helped me, they just lowered my state of alertness from 10/10 to 8/10. Graduation was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. I had planned to sit it out but was bullied into participating by not only my family, but the school staff as well. Even though I persisted for almost a full calendar year, they were persistent as well, and they won. Just a note, I still regret participating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyhow, with the early life stuff out of the way, I was again pushed by my family to get a job. Pretty quickly, I found a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant the next town over. The job was great for the most part, as I worked in the back with pretty much no interaction with anyone. The only problem was that I had to go out into the dining area to get the tubs with the dishes. Every time I had to do this, I was afraid that I was getting in the way of the other employees and the customers, I was afraid that I was going to run into someone or something with the tub or drop it and everything in it would break, and pretty much any other disastrous scenario you could imagine raced through my mind one after the next. This was part of the reason I left the job. The other part was that the sink was too low to the ground, and myself being an exceptionally tall person, I would end each day with searing back pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have spent searching for jobs. Every job I can find that I would reasonably be able to take requires skills or interaction with others that is just way too much for me to handle; not to mention that I was not raised in a particularly educational household, so I have very little, sometimes zero knowledge and experience of what some consider &amp;quot;common skills.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been in one relationship which lasted under a year.I was able to trust her with my completely unmasked thoughts, worries, etc., but I saw that it was often too much for her, so even then, I bottled them up. She eventually broke up with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, my social life has fallen apart. I spend about 99% (not an exaggeration) percent of my time completely alone. I don&amp;#39;t see anyone, I don&amp;#39;t text or message anyone, I don&amp;#39;t call anyone, because it&amp;#39;s just too hard for me to talk about things. I have no ability to engage in small talk, and even with topics I am interested in, it&amp;#39;s hard for me to get involved. Most times I am just a listener. The small bit of time I do spend with people, it&amp;#39;s with 2 old friends from high school, but all of those interactions are just very awkward because I don&amp;#39;t know how to talk about anything. I feel like they are just spending a bit of time with me because they feel bad for me. Often times, it seems like I am a lower priority than whatever notifications they get on their phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now since the second year of high school, I have been smoking cigarettes as kind of a coping mechanism. Nobody knows because I hide it very, very well. Every time I light one, I get really scared of all the toxins in them and what they do and what they probably have already done, but I inhale anyway. I&amp;#39;ve tried to stop many times but I just can&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In every situation I am in, I am also in a constant state of worry. Have never stopped the childhood practice of constant scanning to make sure no one is aiming a gun at me, or setting up a bomb, etc.. Whenever I get home, I unlock the door, enter, lock it behind me, and then proceed to systematically clear the entire house to make sure no one is inside. This includes opening the fridge, oven, and other places that I know are absolutely ridiculous, but I just can&amp;#39;t help it. I have a security alarm system with motion activation throughout the house, but even then, I still set up manual systems that will go off if someone opens a door or window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also believe I suffer from derealization. My first encounter with this was about 6 or 7 months ago. It came on suddenly, I was outside cutting back some blackberry bushes, and it felt as if my mind got very heavy. I looked up and immediately, everything felt off. I could see the sky, and as I looked up, it felt as if the sky was not real and the clouds were plastic. Then it got more local, to the point where I looked around and I knew what the task I was doing was, but it felt like nothing around me was actually there. I walked from where I was back into the house and everything gradually became real again. These types of episodes, I guess they would be called, have happened a few more times, including once recently where I was driving, came within inches of going off a cliff, and didn&amp;#39;t even think about it until a while after I got to my destination. I don&amp;#39;t know if dr symptoms present like that or if it&amp;#39;s something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now finally, to close this off, I have a cat that my family got for me when I was very young. She was adopted, and there&amp;#39;s no solid answer on her age, but we know that she is probably at least 20 years old. While she isn&amp;#39;t showing a lot of signs of her age catching up to her, I know that it eventually will. She&amp;#39;s the only thing that I have had to come home to for so many years; she&amp;#39;s helped me through so many anxiety attacks, depressive episodes, and I know that I will have a very hard time when she does pass on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really sorry for the miniature book. If you actually cared to read all this, thank you. I haven&amp;#39;t even explained why I&amp;#39;m posting this yet. I am posting this to look for help. All of my constant fear is really taxing on me. It would be fantastic to have just one day where I could just be normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would really appreciate suggestions other than to go somewhere for medication.

She holds grudges against things that I\u2019ve apologized for, and she doesn\u2019t seem to see the changes I\u2019ve made to be better.

I don\u2019t want to push her toward anything- I know it\u2019s not my decision to make- but she gets defensive anytime the subject of her anxiety is even brought up, saying that she can handle it herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately, whenever she gets triggered and I am with her, she lashes out at me, telling me to get away from her and that my words mean nothing. When I try and talk to her, she says I am not respecting her. I\u2019ve been giving her space (she now freezes me out for a day or two and waits for me to initiate contact again) but we seldom talk about what triggered her and how we can work through those things together. She says she is tired of talking about these things with me and that it doesn\u2019t help since the attacks keep coming back. I know it\u2019s her prerogative whether or not she wants me to help, and so I try and respect her wishes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fear, though, that she sees me as the problem- and now I fear that maybe I am the problem. I have been doing as much as I can to support her- staying positive and encouraging, sending her reassuring messages every day, reminding her that I am there for her and that I care for her, researching about how to be a supportive partner to someone with GAD, and talking with a therapist myself to help me process everything going on. I have tried to educate myself on how to care for her, and I feel like I do the best job I can do when these situations arise, but it doesn\u2019t feel like she trusts me and maybe even blames me for her attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are times when she is okay (not having an attack) where she asks for reassurance that I won\u2019t give up on her, and I have promised both to her and myself that I won\u2019t. However, I feel pretty helpless at this point, especially since she always pushes me away. I care about her so much, but I know this is not healthy for either of us and that it is unsustainable, and I want to stop this pattern before this relationship becomes irreparably damaged\u2026 if it\u2019s not already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how much of this is my fault and how much of this is the anxiety. I just want to help her. I want her to be happy and healthy, and I know I make her happy. But I am feeling more and more that she might be better off without me in her life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way I can still be a good partner to her?

I\u2019ve been giving her space (she now freezes me out for a day or two and waits for me to initiate contact again) but we seldom talk about what triggered her and how we can work through those things together. She says she is tired of talking about these things with me and that it doesn\u2019t help since the attacks keep coming back. I know it\u2019s her prerogative whether or not she wants me to help, and so I try and respect her wishes.\n\nI fear, though, that she sees me as the problem- and now I fear that maybe I am the problem. I have been doing as much as I can to support her- staying positive and encouraging, sending her reassuring messages every day, reminding her that I am there for her and that I care for her, researching about how to be a supportive partner to someone with GAD, and talking with a therapist myself to help me process everything going on. I have tried to educate myself on how to care for her, and I feel like I do the best job I can do when these situations arise, but it doesn\u2019t feel like she trusts me and maybe even blames me for her attacks.\n\nThere are times when she is okay (not having an attack) where she asks for reassurance that I won\u2019t give up on her, and I have promised both to her and myself that I won\u2019t. However, I feel pretty helpless at this point, especially since she always pushes me away. I care about her so much, but I know this is not healthy for either of us and that it is unsustainable, and I want to stop this pattern before this relationship becomes irreparably damaged\u2026 if it\u2019s not already.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of this is my fault and how much of this is the anxiety. I just want to help her. I want her to be happy and healthy, and I know I make her happy. But I am feeling more and more that she might be better off without me in her life.\n\nIs there a way I can still be a good partner to her? Or this relationship a lost cause?\n\n(tl;dr: my girlfriend pushes me away when she has anxiety attacks because she doesn't trust me to help her deal with it.

I&amp;#39;m alright @ casually talking to people in class/clubs; I&amp;#39;m not the loudest, but I definitely talk more than average. But when it comes to going further (yeah I have them on FB, now I have to message them) I struggle. I always look for reciprocation in people (if they ask if I want to go to something, I can ask them) but it just seems that the other person is never the one to pick up their phone and text/call me.

I know these people wouldn&amp;#39;t look negatively if I asked, I know (pretty sure) that would be interested in meeting outside of class, but I just can&amp;#39;t find it in myself to ask them. The fact that no one has asked me this semester to do something other than studying (go to X event or grab a coffee at Y o&amp;#39;clock) doesn&amp;#39;t help.

I'm alright @ casually talking to people in class/clubs; I'm not the loudest, but I definitely talk more than average. But when it comes to going further (yeah I have them on FB, now I have to message them) I struggle. I always look for reciprocation in people (if they ask if I want to go to something, I can ask them) but it just seems that the other person is never the one to pick up their phone and text/call me. I feel like if I text/call first, it will seem needy, they'll judge me, and I'll look like an idiot. I talk regularly to a handful of people through classes, but even with them I can't find it in myself to offer to grab a coffee / study together / shop downtown. I know these people wouldn't look negatively if I asked, I know (pretty sure) that would be interested in meeting outside of class, but I just can't find it in myself to ask them. The fact that no one has asked me this semester to do something other than studying (go to X event or grab a coffee at Y o'clock) doesn't help. I can't help but feel incredibly self-conscious (what am I doing wrong in class/club that makes people not want to hangout?)\n\nIn terms of meeting other people, I unfortunately don't have many consistent clubs that I can go to (tried and failed to keep going to them @ start of year) and I'm a commuter.\n\n\nNow to you guys: How do you get past your mental block? I've tried just about everything: therapy (tried 4 different therapists/social workers, still have sessions with 1 now), CBT, Mindfulness, etc... but nothing seems to work. I've had several therapists tell me that I've essentially done everything right, I just have to ask people. But I can't seem to get past that mental block.\n\nThanks!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Venting", "id": "7hkne2", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "How do you get past mental blocks, even when you know they're irrational?

Back in the day, it would\u2019ve been brushed aside as the person being too much of a pussy to be able to handle real life, but we\u2019ve become smarter, we\u2019ve become more aware of the fact that this is an actual problem that close to one in five people in America are dealing with currently. I thought I\u2019d share what it\u2019s like to be in the shoes of someone who deals with it on a daily basis. Whether you listen because you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, or you listen because you understand the feeling and you wanted to see if someone else felt the same is up to you. In the end, you wouldn\u2019t be able to understand everything that goes on in this head of mine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being in this head of mine is like the feeling of being trapped in a barren wasteland. One where your screams for help aren\u2019t heard and you\u2019re constantly reminded of the fact that there\u2019s something that went wrong to trap you there in the first place. It\u2019s the constant feeling of inspiration that cannot see the light of day because there\u2019s that one demon that\u2019s keeping you from being you. It\u2019s like that crush you have on some boy or girl that you just can\u2019t vocalize because you realize it may be pointless anyway since they\u2019re way out of your league. The feeling that maybe, just maybe, it\u2019d be better if you saw yourself out of people\u2019s lives because you think you\u2019re an annoyance to literally anyone and everyone that comes across you. When the thoughts of a better life run through your head, something normal like being able to speak up more or being more outgoing, end up seeming too fantastical to entertain and you end up being stuck in that shell you\u2019ve created. You wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the feeling of being in this head of mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture the idea of someone being taken to town by an ant. Take that thought and place it in your head, that\u2019s the idea that anxiety is based off. Everything can be going well, your thoughts can be orderly, your day can be one of the best ones in your life, but it can all be derailed by that single idea, an idea so small, so ant-like. That single idea can be the one thing that may have gone wrong: an insult you took too close to heart, tripping up on your own words when trying to order something to eat, accidentally bumping into someone on the sidewalk because neither of you were able to avoid each other. It doesn\u2019t matter, any of those issues can be magnified to become a problem \u2013 they are magnified to become a problem. It\u2019s like your brain forgets all the good that occurred to you and instead enhances the negative experiences to drown you in a despair that shouldn\u2019t even happen. An idea that takes your whole world out of perspective, places you right in the middle of the labyrinth of consciousness, and forces you to find your way out. An idea so merciless that it eats at you from the deepest recesses of your mind no matter how hard you try to tune it out. No matter how hard you try to fight off that one single thought in your head, that one idea you get when things go wrong, your anxiety would fuel it to a proportion that makes it so unbeatable, it just forces you to give in and suffer to it. You wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the beat-down of any idea born from this head of mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is just the fuel to negative thoughts. It doesn\u2019t cause the thoughts to magically appear out of nowhere, living life as a normal human gives those thoughts life and they\u2019re immediately nurtured into a deadly beast by one\u2019s own anxiety. It\u2019s a constant battle occurring within your own head, as if anxiety is that one mastermind you\u2019re trying to find and kill before he murders you with his minions. Each time you feel like you\u2019ve found the mastermind he just disappears and reappears in a totally different place, giving you a chance for reprieve, but he ends up returning with more force than the last time you went toe-to-toe with him. When he succeeds in crippling you, a panic attack, your entire world stops spinning and you\u2019re stuck in a state of fear that is fueled by the nightmares you\u2019ve experienced before. As if whatever you\u2019ve gone through is back to haunt you just like it had all that time ago. It leaves you breathless, any and all rational thought is placed in the backseat of your mind, your body tenses up as if it goes into its fight or flight response, and your head is spinning trying to discern what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. You wouldn\u2019t live comfortably with the wars I\u2019ve had to wage within this head of mine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sufferers try our best to make sense of the whole idea behind anxiety, we try to find that one thing that could be an end-all cure, but it doesn\u2019t exist. Anxiety is nonsensical, it picks and chooses when to attack and most of the time it turns you against people you find yourself close to. Someone can be simply talking to friends when something that\u2019s said between them triggers that one ant-like idea. It\u2019s like a ball of snow at the top of a hill. That one small ball just needs to start rolling and it\u2019ll start picking up momentum on its own, growing in size and speed until it either hits you or misses. When it misses, it\u2019s not by your own free-will, but it\u2019s relieving. It\u2019s like having some bystander come and pluck you out of the way before you get run over, to have someone call you back to attention and bring your whole world back into perspective before it was too late. However, you lose all hope when that ball hits you. You\u2019re knocked so far sideways you don\u2019t see the anything the same. Those friends instantly become people that are just there because they\u2019re supposed to hang out with you. That small-talk that you were able to chime in on was forced because they pity you and are only keeping you around to use you. Your significant other suddenly becomes a faithless cheater, they\u2019ve been going behind your back the whole time and they have only kept you around because they can take advantage of the fact that you\u2019d move the world over just to be alongside them. Anxiety is like Zemo from Captain America: Civil War, it tries to tear you apart from the inside like Zemo did with the Avengers. You wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the paranoia that spawns from this head of mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s paradoxical to live with anxiety. You understand that it\u2019s just your head playing tricks with you, but you fall for these tricks every time they happen. You want to go out and live your life, but you don\u2019t because you\u2019re scared that living that grand life will tear everything apart. You\u2019re determined yet hesitant, creative yet uninspired, talented yet inept. There\u2019s so much potential residing within you, but you can\u2019t make that potential a reality because of the chains of anxiety. Having anxiety is like the feeling of falling despite being so grounded. You\u2019re incapable of controlling what happens even though you\u2019re perfectly fine. It\u2019s all incomprehensible, no matter what solution you seem to have to get yourself out of the paradox within your head, you seem to trap yourself further down the rabbit hole. As if trying to confront this nonsense makes it harder and harder to manage. It swallows you entirely, you lose all sense of ability to escape from your head, it forces you to cut yourself off from any outside help because it drives home the point that you\u2019re nothing but a deadweight on the lives of others. It controls you through your fears and insecurities, but you\u2019re the one behind the wheel. You wouldn\u2019t handle being taken hostage as I am within this head of mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety makes one a prophet of the worst-case scenario. When \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios arise, you\u2019re immediately pointed to the worst possible outcome because your brain is conditioned to think in such ways because anxiety is behind the reins. You tunnel-vison on that one possible outcome, any consideration for any other solution is immediately thrown out the window and you\u2019re left with either backing out entirely or bracing yourself to the point that you try to come out unaffected. You walk as if you\u2019re about to trip a landmine, you speak in order to please any and all parties, you carry yourself in a manner to bring about the least amount of attention as possible, and when the spotlight lands on you, you try to direct its attention elsewhere. It\u2019s all a process us sufferers have gone through a lot, a process that becomes so automated we don\u2019t realize how self-destructive it can be. The walk we walk could deter people from trusting in us, the way we speak may drive people away because we\u2019re perceived as indecisive, the way you carry yourself can be the difference-maker when wanting to acquire that job, and that spotlight can be positive and it can advance our opportunities if we don\u2019t turn it away. We\u2019re so used to thinking in the worst-case scenario that even when good things come out of the situations we confront, we treat it as luck and nothing more.

We rely on getting diagnosed with a set of questions and nothing more, our answers being the only telling sign for whatever illness we have going on in our head. Anxiety, depression, PTSD, they\u2019re all borne by our head and nothing more. It causes the release of chemicals and hormones that affect the way we live. Living with anxiety is nothing like living with a physical impediment. Mental health shouldn\u2019t be downplayed, it shouldn\u2019t be compared to physical ailments because they\u2019re nothing alike. Until you understand what it\u2019s like to live in this head of mine, you\u2019ll be able to see that I suffer, it\u2019s just not as visible as you would like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Edit: isn't it just nice that I flub up the title\n\nAnxiety is a health issue that\u2019s become more prominent lately, something that this new age of \u201csnowflakes\u201d has wrought on the world.

Anxiety, depression, PTSD, they\u2019re all borne by our head and nothing more. It causes the release of chemicals and hormones that affect the way we live. Living with anxiety is nothing like living with a physical impediment. Mental health shouldn\u2019t be downplayed, it shouldn\u2019t be compared to physical ailments because they\u2019re nothing alike. Until you understand what it\u2019s like to live in this head of mine, you\u2019ll be able to see that I suffer, it\u2019s just not as visible as you would like it to be.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hfe0q", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I wrote an essay abput living with anxiety. i hope it's okay to share it with you all.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 37, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hfe0q", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7hfe0q/i_wrote_an_essay_abput_living_with_anxiety_i_hope/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512395117.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7hfe0q/i_wrote_an_essay_abput_living_with_anxiety_i_hope/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Quil_", "created_utc": 1512366317.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 37}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just made a video sharing my experience on zoloft.

Whenever I catch myself out I feel embarassed that I have such little attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever I listen to music, I shuffle a playlist of songs that I like and have added to the playlist over the years. I have listen to these songs hundreds of times and are pretty much bored of all of them. I never listen to full albums and always skip until I reach a song I&amp;#39;m in the mood to listen to at that moment. And when I&amp;#39;m on that song I just daydream scenarios whilst listening to it. I never walk anywhere without listening to music and I&amp;#39;m in my own head the entire time, daydreaming the same things I&amp;#39;ve daydreamed before. I&amp;#39;ve had it before where I&amp;#39;ve been extremely productive and feeling great so decided to treat myself and walk home listening to music, only to find when I arrive at home I feel terrible again because I&amp;#39;ve been daydreaming the whole way back and feel out of control and anxious again. Not focusing on whats actually going on around me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I read, I constantly close the book and never get through more than a few pages at a time.

I have been very depressed lately because i don&amp;#39;t have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed.

Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I&amp;#39;m afraid of them not understanding me. i just can&amp;#39;t do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I&amp;#39;m very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes.\nI only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don&amp;#39;t know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn&amp;#39;t worked for me.

At this point the solution seems simple- just stick to my healthy lifestyle and look after myself. But the problem is. I can\u2019t.

I need to just to get it out of my head. Apologies for wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Relevant info about myself: I have crippling social anxiety. I&amp;#39;m able to force myself out the door regularly and pretend like I&amp;#39;m fine even though I&amp;#39;m suffering the whole time. Consequently, I have fallen behind the people in my life in many social areas, romance in particular. I used to have no trouble in this area but my anxiety has increased over the last few years and all of my energy just goes in to trying to hold it together around people. But because I can pull this off fairly well, and because I use to do single guy stuff well/have relationships, people just assume I&amp;#39;m your typical single guy in his late 20s enjoying the fruits of being so, but on my own time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Context for what happened: I have 2 half-brothers, both of whom have kids. Birthday parties for those kids can get uncomfortable, because their mom (my dad&amp;#39;s ex-wife) and my parents are not on the best terms, nor am I with their mom for that matter. There is also a lot unsaid from my brothers to my dad about him having left them when they were young, even though they are in their late 40s now, but it adds to the energy of these gatherings. Then there are my brother&amp;#39;s friends who come, their families, etc. A lot of people that I don&amp;#39;t really know that I see regularly and am expected to have some sort of fondness for. There is a tension in the air that most people don&amp;#39;t feel or seem content to ignore, but I usually feel like I&amp;#39;m drowning in it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well today I had to go to one such gathering. And not only that, but I had forgotten it was today, and was settling in to have an anxiety hangover day from having been social the past few days. I got a call from my mom who was already there asking if I was close. I freaked out and got dressed and hopped in a cab. At this point I&amp;#39;m already spiraling, but I RSVP&amp;#39;d and told my parents I would go (we generally try not to let one another go to events like these alone), so I felt obligated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrive, everyone is sitting quietly in a circle chit-chatting. And all attention turns to me. I&amp;#39;m surveying the faces in the room with recognition until I see one that looks out of place, and immediately I feel like I&amp;#39;m in a war zone. It&amp;#39;s a pretty girl sitting next to my sister in law. My immediate thoughts are, &amp;quot;okay, hot girl at a 13 year old&amp;#39;s birthday party who isn&amp;#39;t related to me, and isn&amp;#39;t one of the parents of the kids here... It&amp;#39;s a trap.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I was then distracted by my nieces and nephews running over to show me some love, which was hot fire dopeness. I was able to play with them long enough for the room to lose interest in me and get back to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety then informed me that I was being rude and everyone in the room is pretending they aren&amp;#39;t chaffed by my ignoring them, so I left the kids and walked up to the circle to say hello to the adults. My dad and mom were there, said hi to them first. Nice and easy. Everyone was watching me, so I wanted to dip my toe into the shallow end first. Then I finish hugging my dad and look to see who&amp;#39;s next. And it&amp;#39;s bleak. Next to my mom is my dad&amp;#39;s ex-wife. No thanks. Next to my dad is one of my brother&amp;#39;s friend&amp;#39;s wives whom I know pretty well but am not close enough with to cut through the circle to give her a hug without feeling super awkward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I wave at her hello. Then is my sister in law who stands up and tells me to come across to her to give her a hug. I comply -- I like her and it&amp;#39;s nice to see her. And she&amp;#39;s the hostess so I have to say hi anyway, right? Normal person stuff? She then says &amp;quot;you know X, Y, and Z&amp;quot;, pointing to other members of the circle that I do in fact know. I say yes and wave hello. &amp;quot;And this,&amp;quot; she says, gesturing to pretty girl intentionally saved for last, &amp;quot;is &lt;code&gt;pretty girl intentionally saved for last&amp;#39;s name&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;quot; We can call her Judge Dredd because I dreaded and felt judged by her. I say hello and shake her hand and she says hi and smiles. &amp;quot;Judge Dredd is my teaching assistant,&amp;quot; says my sister in law. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then have a moment where I pause and I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself, sister in law is trying to facilitate a conversation with Judge Dredd right here, already. Literally in the middle of this circle where I&amp;#39;m the only one standing, with the eyes of all of these people I am already uncomfortable around on me. In hindsight I realized that giving the context for a newcomer&amp;#39;s presence is a normal thing to do, but behind enemy lines it was an IED in plain sight. So I said &amp;quot;oh cool!&amp;quot; and I turned around and got the fuck out of that circle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have much of a plan at that point, but thankfully I saw my two brothers chatting alone in the kitchen. Perfect. I head straight to them. My anxiety is chuckling at me and calling me a pussy, telling me that was super awkward, but I fight back by saying I haven&amp;#39;t said hi to my brothers, the only other people in this room I love as much as my parents and the kids. Of course I want to go debrief with them. So I say what&amp;#39;s up to them and we start shooting the shit. And it&amp;#39;s dope, of course. We catch up crack jokes. And we are left alone in the kitchen because it&amp;#39;s bro time and the people respect that. I&amp;#39;m desperately thinking to myself &amp;quot;if only I can find a way to stay in this kitchen until I can leave without being rude for not having stayed long enough, maybe I can play it off to Judge Dredd like &lt;code&gt;great to meet you! sorry we didn&amp;#39;t get to catch up!&lt;/code&gt; and escape unscathed.&amp;quot; Then brother 1 leaves the kitchen, he&amp;#39;s gotta drive his kid somewhere real quick. Me and brother 2 are chillin eating a slice of pizza. Judge Dredd walks up as we&amp;#39;re talking and slips between us to grab a slice and some water. I am only half listening to what brother 2 is saying at this point because I&amp;#39;m so fucking out of sorts. Like she was a walking flash-bang grenade. She slips past us again and the world comes back into focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You should fuck her&amp;quot; brother 2 says. And my heart sinks. I thought I&amp;#39;d found refuge! Now I need to make it seem like I&amp;#39;m normal to my own brother (who, to be fair, has no idea I suffer from this, which is my fault). &amp;quot;Nah man,&amp;quot; I say, pretending like I&amp;#39;m all cool and shit and not a quivering Jenga tower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Too old?&amp;quot; he asks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not here,&amp;quot; I say. &amp;quot;Situation&amp;#39;s just off.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And brother 2 makes a brotherly joke: &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t mean fuck her here, my kids are here. Fuck her at your place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I force a laugh. Painfully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I get it man,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I guess I haven&amp;#39;t worried about &lt;code&gt;the situation&lt;/code&gt; in a while because I&amp;#39;ve been married to sister in law for X years.&amp;quot; Fucking thank god. Maybe we can move past this. Then he says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d still fuck her if I were you though.&amp;quot; And I chuckle and pretend I&amp;#39;m not aware of the beads of sweat forming on my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hah, maybe.&amp;quot; is all I can get out. And he looks at me and says &amp;quot;Yeah that&amp;#39;s the kind of maybe you give when you&amp;#39;re ready to stop talking about something.&amp;quot; I chuckle and shake my head praying that I am still coming off as normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In walks dad, thank god. &amp;quot;My boys,&amp;quot; he says and gives us both a hearty slap on the arm. He then turns to me and says &amp;quot;So, me and mom think you should date Judge Dredd.&amp;quot; Brother 2 starts cracking up. I shake my head and look at the floor and say &amp;quot;Fucking pimps.&amp;quot; My dad laughs but I think he gets it. We bullshit about other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In walks mom. Mom doesn&amp;#39;t bother with small talk. She walks up to me and says, &amp;quot;You. Talk to Judge Dredd.&amp;quot; Dad and brother 2 start cracking up and I realize that my soul has drifted out of my body and I am staring down at the empty husk of my former self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have words left for mom. &amp;quot;Leave him be&amp;quot; says dad, chuckling. Bless you dad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I start to realize it&amp;#39;s looking weird that I&amp;#39;m just hanging out in the small kitchen. It&amp;#39;s been a while. People clearly have come in just to talk to me. Not for normal kitchen stuff. I fight every instinct I have and walk out of the kitchen. Oldest nephew is on his computer in the living room with one of his friends doing computer stuff. I like computer stuff. I walk over to them and ask about what they&amp;#39;re doing. It&amp;#39;s cool stuff and we talk about it a bit. I then get in an argument with oldest nephew&amp;#39;s friend about the pinnacle of gaming controllers (Wii U Pro). I&amp;#39;m now at a party where there is an attractive girl everyone is waiting for me to talk to and I&amp;#39;m arguing with a teenager who is not related to me about video game stuff, right in front of everyone. Sister in law is starting to make eyes at me. I turn and tell oldest nephew&amp;#39;s friend he&amp;#39;s out of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brother 1 comes back with his kiddos and brings with him welcome momentum. It&amp;#39;s now present opening time. A welcome respite. We all get to sit around and watch my niece performs the present opening ceremony. I can sit silently, no problemo. People start to rearrange themselves so that everyone is facing my niece. During this process, Judge Dredd is up and about. She walks in front of me as I&amp;#39;m chatting with brother 1. He stops talking. He nods towards her and then gives me one of these: &lt;a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/iSKFtpF2HzneE/giphy.gif\"&gt;https://media.giphy.com/media/iSKFtpF2HzneE/giphy.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shake my head and roll my eyes and he cracks up. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not the first, am I?&amp;quot; he asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Far from it&amp;quot; I say. And he howls. Loves it. Hate myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m exhausted. I feel like a shell. All of my allies have turned on me. There&amp;#39;s no refuge. Only my incredibly apparent unwillingness to talk to Judge Dredd. I can&amp;#39;t even look a her at this point. Anxiety pops in to inform me that everyone is starting to realize that something is not right. &amp;quot;Is something wrong with him? Maybe he&amp;#39;s secretly gay? Maybe he&amp;#39;s asexual? Btw those teenagers over there think you&amp;#39;re a huge loser.&amp;quot; Youngest niece runs up to me for some hug love. A little soul warmth. Bless her. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re quiet!&amp;quot; she declares, and runs off. Betrayed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Brother in law!&amp;quot; Sister in law calls me out from across the room. &amp;quot;Come here you&amp;#39;ve been ignoring me all day!&amp;quot; Fake pouty face. Judge Dredd is sitting on the couch next to her, a black hole pulling me towards impeding doom. Thank god brother 1 is occupying the other seat on the couch. I sit in an empty seat that gives me a view of sister in law and perfectly angles out Judge Dredd from my line of sight due to brother 1&amp;#39;s frame. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sup?&amp;quot; I say to sister in law. Yeah. All cool over here. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll join this circle,&amp;quot; I say. Like it was my idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot; she asks. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s goin on?&amp;quot; Judge Dredd has angled herself so that she is now visible. She looks interested in this conversation. I determinedly look at sister in law and smile with what I hope is charm and say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Niece begins opening presents. Saved. Attention of the room turns to her. I watch and try to remember how to sit on a chair in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t belie self-loathing and inadequacy. Someone got niece a microphone. &amp;quot;Sing!&amp;quot; says niece&amp;#39;s grandma (sister in law&amp;#39;s mom). &amp;quot;Sing a song you wrote!&amp;quot; Niece grabs a guitar and sings a song she wrote. It&amp;#39;s nice. &amp;quot;Sing it AGAIN!&amp;quot; shouts grandma. I turn and stare at grandma incredulously. It wasn&amp;#39;t THAT nice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A plan starts to form. I look at mom and dad. They too are looking at grandma with &amp;quot;really?&amp;quot; eyes. They want to leave. I can feel it. I quietly go to the kitchen to grab some water as Niece begins round 2, conveniently removing myself from the circle for when the room&amp;#39;s attention inevitably dilutes and I&amp;#39;m back on the radar. I head over to mom and dad and we silently indicate agreement that grandma just held us all hostage and it&amp;#39;s time to bounce. Time to make moves! I&amp;#39;m almost home free. The smoldering ember of hope flares in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad has to pee. Fuck. Okay. Talk to mom. Cake is being served. Youngest niece runs over to ask if mom wants cake. Mom says yes because youngest niece is a cute kiddo who asked very cutely. Now mom is eating cake. I am standing there watching mom eat cake. Judge Dredd is sitting on the couch with sister in law, looking a bit confused and put out. Sister in law is talking to her but also scanning the room to look for me it seems. I edge out of her line of sight and watch mom eat cake from a little farther away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad is out of the bathroom. And it seems he went and found our jackets as well. Extra point to dad. We start putting them on and the goodbyes begin. Sister in law is still on the couch with Judge Dredd. Maybe they&amp;#39;re so engaged in whatever they&amp;#39;re talking about that we can slip out and I can apologize for not saying bye next time I see her. Brother 1 Brother 2 hug dopeness. Other sister in law hug dopeness. Niece and nephews hug dopeness. We&amp;#39;re at the door. Anxiety whispers in my ear that they all know that something is wrong with me and will be trying to figure out what it is from this point forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sister in law has left the couch. I was distracted and lost sight of her. In fact the couch is empty. Sister in law is coming in for a goodbye, and Judge Dredd is hot on her heels. I look around desperately. I&amp;#39;ve already hugged everyone in the vicinity. Anxiety reminds me that Judge Dredd is very likely an awesome person and that I probably made her wonder what&amp;#39;s wrong with her for not even giving her the time of day. I open my arms to hug sister in law before she gets here. If I hug her I can leave. She is the final boss of this hellscape. But Dad is closer. He gets the hug. I go up close, arms still outstretched. I&amp;#39;m already on a hug course for sister in law, can&amp;#39;t switch now. Dad lingers and says nice things to sister in law. God dammit dad. I&amp;#39;m still here. Arms outstretched. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They break. I hug sister in law before there can be eye contact and say &amp;quot;love you!&amp;quot; She mumbles something about it being great to see me. We break and as I turn, hoping to escape without finding out what her eyes have in store for my self worth, mine and hers meet for one second that for me stretched out into eternity. In her eyes I saw reflected back at me all of my failures and flaws as a man--the crumbling facade of the well adjusted person I so desperately need to be perceived as. Anxiety sidled up, took one look at her face, looked back at me and said &amp;quot;Yup&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something broke in me at that point. With my last ounce of willpower I forced a smile at her and turned to leave. Judge Dredd was hovering nearby but I just put my head down and booked it. Anxiety fist pumped and called after me, &amp;quot;Nice, now you come off as a rude prick as well!&amp;quot; I couldn&amp;#39;t begin to figure out how to say goodbye to her. All the brainpower I had left was poured into getting my limbs to move in such a way that would extricate me from this situation. Mom and dad get the message. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A nightmare!&amp;quot; I say to them when we&amp;#39;re outside. They chuckle and agree that those parties are always a nightmare but this one wasn&amp;#39;t so bad. &amp;quot;That set up!&amp;quot; I stammer. They chuckle. I can&amp;#39;t make more words happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry about it,&amp;quot; says mom.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm still shaking as I write this from shell shock. I need to just to get it out of my head. Apologies for wall of text.\n\nRelevant info about myself: I have crippling social anxiety. I'm able to force myself out the door regularly and pretend like I'm fine even though I'm suffering the whole time. Consequently, I have fallen behind the people in my life in many social areas, romance in particular. I used to have no trouble in this area but my anxiety has increased over the last few years and all of my energy just goes in to trying to hold it together around people. But because I can pull this off fairly well, and because I use to do single guy stuff well/have relationships, people just assume I'm your typical single guy in his late 20s enjoying the fruits of being so, but on my own time. \n\nContext for what happened: I have 2 half-brothers, both of whom have kids. Birthday parties for those kids can get uncomfortable, because their mom (my dad's ex-wife) and my parents are not on the best terms, nor am I with their mom for that matter. There is also a lot unsaid from my brothers to my dad about him having left them when they were young, even though they are in their late 40s now, but it adds to the energy of these gatherings. Then there are my brother's friends who come, their families, etc. A lot of people that I don't really know that I see regularly and am expected to have some sort of fondness for. There is a tension in the air that most people don't feel or seem content to ignore, but I usually feel like I'm drowning in it. \n\nWell today I had to go to one such gathering. And not only that, but I had forgotten it was today, and was settling in to have an anxiety hangover day from having been social the past few days. I got a call from my mom who was already there asking if I was close. I freaked out and got dressed and hopped in a cab. At this point I'm already spiraling, but I RSVP'd and told my parents I would go (we generally try not to let one another go to events like these alone), so I felt obligated.\n\nWhen I arrive, everyone is sitting quietly in a circle chit-chatting. And all attention turns to me. I'm surveying the faces in the room with recognition until I see one that looks out of place, and immediately I feel like I'm in a war zone. It's a pretty girl sitting next to my sister in law. My immediate thoughts are, \"okay, hot girl at a 13 year old's birthday party who isn't related to me, and isn't one of the parents of the kids here... It's a trap.\" \n\nThankfully I was then distracted by my nieces and nephews running over to show me some love, which was hot fire dopeness. I was able to play with them long enough for the room to lose interest in me and get back to the conversation.\n\nAnxiety then informed me that I was being rude and everyone in the room is pretending they aren't chaffed by my ignoring them, so I left the kids and walked up to the circle to say hello to the adults. My dad and mom were there, said hi to them first. Nice and easy. Everyone was watching me, so I wanted to dip my toe into the shallow end first. Then I finish hugging my dad and look to see who's next. And it's bleak. Next to my mom is my dad's ex-wife. No thanks. Next to my dad is one of my brother's friend's wives whom I know pretty well but am not close enough with to cut through the circle to give her a hug without feeling super awkward.\n\nSo I wave at her hello. Then is my sister in law who stands up and tells me to come across to her to give her a hug. I comply -- I like her and it's nice to see her. And she's the hostess so I have to say hi anyway, right? Normal person stuff? She then says \"you know X, Y, and Z\", pointing to other members of the circle that I do in fact know. I say yes and wave hello. \"And this,\" she says, gesturing to pretty girl intentionally saved for last, \"is `pretty girl intentionally saved for last's name`.\" We can call her Judge Dredd because I dreaded and felt judged by her. I say hello and shake her hand and she says hi and smiles. \"Judge Dredd is my teaching assistant,\" says my sister in law. \n\nI then have a moment where I pause and I'm thinking to myself, sister in law is trying to facilitate a conversation with Judge Dredd right here, already. Literally in the middle of this circle where I'm the only one standing, with the eyes of all of these people I am already uncomfortable around on me. In hindsight I realized that giving the context for a newcomer's presence is a normal thing to do, but behind enemy lines it was an IED in plain sight. So I said \"oh cool!\" and I turned around and got the fuck out of that circle. \n\nI didn't have much of a plan at that point, but thankfully I saw my two brothers chatting alone in the kitchen. Perfect. I head straight to them. My anxiety is chuckling at me and calling me a pussy, telling me that was super awkward, but I fight back by saying I haven't said hi to my brothers, the only other people in this room I love as much as my parents and the kids. Of course I want to go debrief with them. So I say what's up to them and we start shooting the shit. And it's dope, of course. We catch up crack jokes. And we are left alone in the kitchen because it's bro time and the people respect that. I'm desperately thinking to myself \"if only I can find a way to stay in this kitchen until I can leave without being rude for not having stayed long enough, maybe I can play it off to Judge Dredd like `great to meet you! sorry we didn't get to catch up!` and escape unscathed.\" Then brother 1 leaves the kitchen, he's gotta drive his kid somewhere real quick. Me and brother 2 are chillin eating a slice of pizza. Judge Dredd walks up as we're talking and slips between us to grab a slice and some water. I am only half listening to what brother 2 is saying at this point because I'm so fucking out of sorts. Like she was a walking flash-bang grenade. She slips past us again and the world comes back into focus.\n\n\"You should fuck her\" brother 2 says. And my heart sinks. I thought I'd found refuge! Now I need to make it seem like I'm normal to my own brother (who, to be fair, has no idea I suffer from this, which is my fault). \"Nah man,\" I say, pretending like I'm all cool and shit and not a quivering Jenga tower.\n\n\"Too old?\" he asks. \n\n\"Not here,\" I say. \"Situation's just off.\" \n\nAnd brother 2 makes a brotherly joke: \"I didn't mean fuck her here, my kids are here. Fuck her at your place.\"\n\nI force a laugh. Painfully.\n\n\"I get it man,\" he says. \"I guess I haven't worried about `the situation` in a while because I've been married to sister in law for X years.\" Fucking thank god. Maybe we can move past this. Then he says, \"I'd still fuck her if I were you though.\" And I chuckle and pretend I'm not aware of the beads of sweat forming on my head. \n\n\"Hah, maybe.\" is all I can get out. And he looks at me and says \"Yeah that's the kind of maybe you give when you're ready to stop talking about something.\" I chuckle and shake my head praying that I am still coming off as normal. \n\nIn walks dad, thank god. \"My boys,\" he says and gives us both a hearty slap on the arm. He then turns to me and says \"So, me and mom think you should date Judge Dredd.\" Brother 2 starts cracking up. I shake my head and look at the floor and say \"Fucking pimps.\" My dad laughs but I think he gets it. We bullshit about other stuff.\n\nIn walks mom. Mom doesn't bother with small talk. She walks up to me and says, \"You. Talk to Judge Dredd.\" Dad and brother 2 start cracking up and I realize that my soul has drifted out of my body and I am staring down at the empty husk of my former self.\n\nI don't have words left for mom. \"Leave him be\" says dad, chuckling. Bless you dad. \n\nNow I start to realize it's looking weird that I'm just hanging out in the small kitchen. It's been a while. People clearly have come in just to talk to me. Not for normal kitchen stuff. I fight every instinct I have and walk out of the kitchen. Oldest nephew is on his computer in the living room with one of his friends doing computer stuff. I like computer stuff. I walk over to them and ask about what they're doing. It's cool stuff and we talk about it a bit. I then get in an argument with oldest nephew's friend about the pinnacle of gaming controllers (Wii U Pro). I'm now at a party where there is an attractive girl everyone is waiting for me to talk to and I'm arguing with a teenager who is not related to me about video game stuff, right in front of everyone. Sister in law is starting to make eyes at me. I turn and tell oldest nephew's friend he's out of his mind.\n\nBrother 1 comes back with his kiddos and brings with him welcome momentum. It's now present opening time. A welcome respite. We all get to sit around and watch my niece performs the present opening ceremony. I can sit silently, no problemo. People start to rearrange themselves so that everyone is facing my niece. During this process, Judge Dredd is up and about. She walks in front of me as I'm chatting with brother 1. He stops talking. He nods towards her and then gives me one of these: https://media.giphy.com/media/iSKFtpF2HzneE/giphy.gif\n\nI shake my head and roll my eyes and he cracks up. \"I'm not the first, am I?\" he asks.\n\n\"Far from it\" I say. And he howls. Loves it. Hate myself.\n\nAt this point I'm exhausted. I feel like a shell. All of my allies have turned on me. There's no refuge. Only my incredibly apparent unwillingness to talk to Judge Dredd. I can't even look a her at this point. Anxiety pops in to inform me that everyone is starting to realize that something is not right. \"Is something wrong with him? Maybe he's secretly gay? Maybe he's asexual? Btw those teenagers over there think you're a huge loser.\" Youngest niece runs up to me for some hug love. A little soul warmth. Bless her. \"You're quiet!\" she declares, and runs off. Betrayed. \n\n\"Brother in law!\" Sister in law calls me out from across the room. \"Come here you've been ignoring me all day!\" Fake pouty face. Judge Dredd is sitting on the couch next to her, a black hole pulling me towards impeding doom. Thank god brother 1 is occupying the other seat on the couch. I sit in an empty seat that gives me a view of sister in law and perfectly angles out Judge Dredd from my line of sight due to brother 1's frame. \n\n\"Sup?\" I say to sister in law. Yeah. All cool over here. \"I'll join this circle,\" I say. Like it was my idea.\n\n\"How are you?\" she asks. \"What's goin on?\" Judge Dredd has angled herself so that she is now visible. She looks interested in this conversation. I determinedly look at sister in law and smile with what I hope is charm and say \"I'm good.\"\n\nNiece begins opening presents. Saved. Attention of the room turns to her. I watch and try to remember how to sit on a chair in a way that doesn't belie self-loathing and inadequacy. Someone got niece a microphone. \"Sing!\" says niece's grandma (sister in law's mom). \"Sing a song you wrote!\" Niece grabs a guitar and sings a song she wrote. It's nice. \"Sing it AGAIN!\" shouts grandma. I turn and stare at grandma incredulously. It wasn't THAT nice. \n\nA plan starts to form. I look at mom and dad. They too are looking at grandma with \"really?\" eyes. They want to leave. I can feel it. I quietly go to the kitchen to grab some water as Niece begins round 2, conveniently removing myself from the circle for when the room's attention inevitably dilutes and I'm back on the radar. I head over to mom and dad and we silently indicate agreement that grandma just held us all hostage and it's time to bounce. Time to make moves! I'm almost home free. The smoldering ember of hope flares in my heart.\n\nDad has to pee. Fuck. Okay. Talk to mom. Cake is being served. Youngest niece runs over to ask if mom wants cake. Mom says yes because youngest niece is a cute kiddo who asked very cutely. Now mom is eating cake. I am standing there watching mom eat cake. Judge Dredd is sitting on the couch with sister in law, looking a bit confused and put out. Sister in law is talking to her but also scanning the room to look for me it seems. I edge out of her line of sight and watch mom eat cake from a little farther away.\n\nDad is out of the bathroom. And it seems he went and found our jackets as well. Extra point to dad. We start putting them on and the goodbyes begin. Sister in law is still on the couch with Judge Dredd. Maybe they're so engaged in whatever they're talking about that we can slip out and I can apologize for not saying bye next time I see her. Brother 1 Brother 2 hug dopeness. Other sister in law hug dopeness. Niece and nephews hug dopeness. We're at the door. Anxiety whispers in my ear that they all know that something is wrong with me and will be trying to figure out what it is from this point forward.\n\nSister in law has left the couch. I was distracted and lost sight of her. In fact the couch is empty. Sister in law is coming in for a goodbye, and Judge Dredd is hot on her heels. I look around desperately. I've already hugged everyone in the vicinity. Anxiety reminds me that Judge Dredd is very likely an awesome person and that I probably made her wonder what's wrong with her for not even giving her the time of day. I open my arms to hug sister in law before she gets here. If I hug her I can leave. She is the final boss of this hellscape. But Dad is closer. He gets the hug. I go up close, arms still outstretched. I'm already on a hug course for sister in law, can't switch now. Dad lingers and says nice things to sister in law. God dammit dad. I'm still here. Arms outstretched. \n\nThey break. I hug sister in law before there can be eye contact and say \"love you!\" She mumbles something about it being great to see me. We break and as I turn, hoping to escape without finding out what her eyes have in store for my self worth, mine and hers meet for one second that for me stretched out into eternity. In her eyes I saw reflected back at me all of my failures and flaws as a man--the crumbling facade of the well adjusted person I so desperately need to be perceived as. Anxiety sidled up, took one look at her face, looked back at me and said \"Yup\".\n\nSomething broke in me at that point. With my last ounce of willpower I forced a smile at her and turned to leave. Judge Dredd was hovering nearby but I just put my head down and booked it. Anxiety fist pumped and called after me, \"Nice, now you come off as a rude prick as well!\" I couldn't begin to figure out how to say goodbye to her. All the brainpower I had left was poured into getting my limbs to move in such a way that would extricate me from this situation. Mom and dad get the message. \n\n\"A nightmare!\" I say to them when we're outside. They chuckle and agree that those parties are always a nightmare but this one wasn't so bad. \"That set up!\" I stammer. They chuckle. I can't make more words happen.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" says mom.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false,

Probably like yourself, I&amp;#39;ve spent a LOT of time and effort trying to figure out how to feel alright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;ve had some success! So I wanted to write out some key ideas that have been helpful for me, in case they might also work for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;1: Anxiety is what you get when you carry painful ideas in your mind.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all tend to believe any ideas that appear in our minds, especially ones that have been kicking around for a long time. A lot of these are inherited from our parents and societies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may have been told that you&amp;#39;re not valuable, or that you don&amp;#39;t deserve love until you get your work done, or that no one is interested in you. You may have been told something like these when you were very young and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When painful thoughts like these are internalized, they essentially become the drama of your life. This results in painful drama, over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in order to overcome anxiety, a HUGE benefit is to look inside your thought-structure for where you foster beliefs that are hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Refusing to acknowledge reality causes anxiety.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that causes anxiety is just refusing to accept this moment as it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of confusion about this type of sentiment, but if you&amp;#39;re willing to really consider it, then you stand to experience many breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how this works: Whatever it is; if you&amp;#39;ve lost money, lost a loved one, lost a limb, lost a prized possession, lost a game, or have otherwise experienced some form of loss, it CAN bring up a strong experience of grief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with grief&lt;/em&gt; and it&amp;#39;s certainly nothing to be afraid of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But grief can sometimes be so intense, that a person might turn away from it, negate it, and take to drugs, alcohol or some other distraction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However the emotional experience of grief is a one-time thing. It can certainly be delayed for a long time, but when you&amp;#39;re willing to face it, look at it, and give it room to pass through you - then it&amp;#39;s done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore if you give yourself time to allow your unexpressed emotions to process, you&amp;#39;ll find that you don&amp;#39;t have to shove them out of your experience anymore. You will feel very peaceful, and still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Look toward where your anxiety is guiding you.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, anxiety is a &amp;quot;warning light&amp;quot; in your system telling you that something&amp;#39;s wrong, and needs to be corrected. There&amp;#39;s a disconnect between life and your relationship with life. You are being guided to rectify your relationship with life so that harmony can be restored. This is how anxiety is healed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety, if you pay attention, is always guiding you down into a &amp;quot;vortex&amp;quot; of sorts. It&amp;#39;s typically guiding you toward giving something up, or surrendering some sort of effort. You&amp;#39;re being guided toward releasing or relinquishing some type of control. You&amp;#39;re being asked to open your hands, float freely, and say YES to whatever threat is present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course if there&amp;#39;s an actual physical threat, such as an angry bison running toward you, then get out of there, get to safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re sitting safely in your room, browsing Reddit, no threat anywhere in your space... and your mind is telling you that you&amp;#39;re about to die, consider bringing your attention to THAT &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; which is not a real threat, but a fear that just needs to be consciously met.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all! Everything here has been incredibly helpful for me and I hope it helps you become more peaceful as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No pressure either way, but I love to coach people online on dropping their anxiety and coming back into emotional wellness. Please let me know if you&amp;#39;d be interested - send me a PM asking for details and I&amp;#39;ll respond soon :).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take care!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey!\n\nMy name is Brent, and I've had anxiety for the majority of my life.

You will feel very peaceful, and still.\n\n## 3. Look toward where your anxiety is guiding you.\n\nUltimately, anxiety is a \"warning light\" in your system telling you that something's wrong, and needs to be corrected. There's a disconnect between life and your relationship with life. You are being guided to rectify your relationship with life so that harmony can be restored. This is how anxiety is healed.\n\nAnxiety, if you pay attention, is always guiding you down into a \"vortex\" of sorts. It's typically guiding you toward giving something up, or surrendering some sort of effort. You're being guided toward releasing or relinquishing some type of control. You're being asked to open your hands, float freely, and say YES to whatever threat is present.\n\nOf course if there's an actual physical threat, such as an angry bison running toward you, then get out of there, get to safety.\n\nBut if you're sitting safely in your room, browsing Reddit, no threat anywhere in your space... and your mind is telling you that you're about to die, consider bringing your attention to THAT \"threat\" which is not a real threat, but a fear that just needs to be consciously met.\n\n-----\n\nThat's all! Everything here has been incredibly helpful for me and I hope it helps you become more peaceful as well.\n\nNo pressure either way, but I love to coach people online on dropping their anxiety and coming back into emotional wellness. Please let me know if you'd be interested - send me a PM asking for details and I'll respond soon :).\n\nTake care!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hcsf0", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "These Three Ideas have been the Most Helpful for me", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hcsf0", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7hcsf0/these_three_ideas_have_been_the_most_helpful_for/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512367694.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7hcsf0/these_three_ideas_have_been_the_most_helpful_for/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "brenthuras", "created_utc": 1512338894.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "promo_adult_nsfw", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have one?

I find myself longing to not be alone, to have true friends and to have a good time. I have let friendships and contacts pass me by for the longer period of my life. Not going to parties or seeking out a deeper friendship with people I know. At sports I was the quiet guy who shows up, plays the match, sticks around but doesn&amp;#39;t really interact. Up untill 6 months ago I would spend most of my weekends alone gaming most of the day and not really seeking out interaction with people that I know. I have zero friends left from highschool/study as I either didn&amp;#39;t reach out to them or let it fade away. The contact and friendship I do have are mostly work related. As a teacher I often find myself surrounded by female co-workers. This all was fine for the longer period of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 years ago a male co-worker joined at school. Around my age and rather socialable. He&amp;#39;s a relaxed, somewhat &amp;quot;surf-dude&amp;quot; attitude guy. Goes with the flow. He&amp;#39;s an excellent co-worker that teaches P.E. and has a broad knowlegde of sports himself as well as practises a couple. For the first year I didn&amp;#39;t really open up towards him, same as I always did. Sure we had laughs at school, some drinks at school together but nothing more. Eventually we started being more drawn to eachother as contacts, good co-workers. The first time something clicked was during Kingsnight (dutch..). Last june he casually invited me to his birthday. It spiralled my thoughts and myself out of control. A person like him, liking me and inviting me to his birthday? Are we friends? Are we good? Why would he do that? It was a good birthday that lasted till 6.00 am, The day after I spend most of the day mentally beating myself up wondering if this was friendship, how this could be, does he like me etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly someone had passed my guards, jumped over them and reached out to me after not knowing what I was missing out on all those years. He, perhaps unknowingly made me realise that I do long for friends and bro&amp;#39;s and that I do want to have a good time in the weekend. My self image got turn upside down and I began to fight and rejecting parts of me. I blamed myself, I struggled, I didn&amp;#39;t love myself and after a couple of sessions it became clear that this was normal for me. That I&amp;#39;ve always done this and that I&amp;#39;ve never really loved myself.\nAt the same time I realized this co-worker could become a friend. And for the first time in forever.... I began investing in said friendship. I started reaching out during summer holiday (6 weeks of no work, 6 weeks of anxiety!) He also started reaching out to me, asking me to join along for a couple of festivals. I went to his new home to help him paint the walls and a few times. When school started again in August we&amp;#39;d done several very friendship things together. I told him I was struggling with myself and opened up a bit towards him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here we are now. I&amp;#39;ve done quite a lot and do consider him a true friend. Something that I&amp;#39;ve missed. It makes me feel anxious on a frequent basis. Why me, why do I deserve him, how can he be friends with me when he knows so many people and yet he wants to spend time with me as well. It makes me feel very uneasy and insecure. We&amp;#39;ve been going to soccer matches together, theatre visit and reaching out to each other. I just ask if he has plans, he somewhat more actively arranges things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At school we have an &amp;quot;appriciation stone&amp;quot;.... that we pass to eachother. I chose him because of his work and that he does a lot for the school. That evening I got a text that he was moved by it. On another occasion he helped me with by listening and offering advice after I had a falling out with my mother (about all thos anxious issues). For secret santa I gave him a present and a thank you note that I appriciate him being there for me in though times and that I value the bond I have.\nI keep struggling with the notion of his friendship though. He even said there&amp;#39;s no need for insecurity directed towards him and that he likes to spend time with me as well. And yet I keep worrying, am I not too pushy/needy, won&amp;#39;t I screw it up. I keep panicking when its weekend (weekends are difficult...) and wonder if it&amp;#39;s okay to reach out to him. After reaching out I instantly regret it. And often he&amp;#39;s busy with sports or something. It&amp;#39;s ok and I understand that he has a bigger social network then I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find myself liking the time I spend with him and looking for the next moment. We&amp;#39;ve got several things planned including another soccer match, a weekend away and some theatre/concerts. I text him when, after an hour struggling with anxiety, when I feel alone or rather want to seek out friendship. This mostly happens in the weekend. I worry if I don&amp;#39;t come across as desperate and am afraid that I will ruin it by asking.\nAfter typing all of this I believe this is friendship mixed in with persistant anxious thoughts, love for a friend. Perhaps I could be oblivious. I do think about him on frequent basis. I also find myself admiring his looks, because he certainly has a strong physique and I am look like a twig and general displeased with how I look. He matters a lot in my life at the moment, seeking his companionship allows me to forget my own self doubts and feel valued as someone likes to spend time with me.

At this time last year I was in college and had a job pursuing my career. Now, I\u2019ve dropped out and I\u2019m working a dead end job but I couldn\u2019t be happier of where I\u2019m at in life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s just start by saying the stresses of school and work defiantly got the best of me, so much that I decided to get medicated for depression. But like most people I thought the pill was a cure and I decided it wasn\u2019t working and got off it. Unfortunately, I still thought there was a for sure cure to anxiety/depression/ whatever else I might have, so I found this new amazing med that did wonders. That medication was weed.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marijuana is known for helping with anxiety and depression and for very a good reason, IT WORKS. But I am not condoning the uses without regulation, because of my experience. For about 7 months I didn\u2019t go one day without hitting my bowl 2-3 times. It made me feel stress free, pain free, and anxiety free. At the beginning of my spree, in about June, I was on top of the world, there wasn\u2019t one thing that could get me down, not even my cloudy future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what a cloudy future it was. June was amazing, I had the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life, I was just happy, content. I\u2019m sure July was amazing too, my birthday is in July! But because of the weed I cannot for the life of me remember that month... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the landslide of my journey. By August I was fired, for not getting to work on time. Fortunately I had enough money to sober up and get a new job! So I had to do the worst thing I could do for myself which was nothing. I was stuck between jobs and not going to school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So August I did absolutely nothing, expect smoke some more weed. I knew this was dumb but I couldn\u2019t get myself to stop. This led to my depression just taking over my mind, I hit rock bottom and almost drove my car into a pole, on purpose. At the last second I turned with the road and not into the pole, I was actually ready to die but just couldn\u2019t muster up the \u201cstrength\u201d to do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This leads into September, and November, I was still smoking a lot of weed but recovered just enough to get a job and not starve to death. So I was basically just repeating the pattern from June and not trying to get better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, like I said earlier WEED WORKS. At this point I felt okay with life, I wasn\u2019t feeling depressed, not too anxious and had a job I actually liked doing. I was still smoking weed, more than ever actually, but there was one thing different with my smoking now than from June. In June I wanted a \u201cmind high\u201d I wanted to think and I wanted to figure my mind out, I unlocked my mind and started to put the crazy puzzle together. In November I only wanted a body high. I started to actually hate smoking weed for a mind high, it made me sick to my stomach not remembering 3 days or acting normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally decided enough was enough. I had two cuts of weed left and I decided I\u2019m smoking all of it up and never doing it again. So I did the thing that I felt would help me stop the best and that was to throw my bowl away for good. I didn\u2019t just put in it the garbage either, I did what any dramatic stoner would do and I threw it off of a mountain, at least a 75 foot drop, so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted by that thing ever again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that brings me to right now. I threw my bowl two days ago. I used to do literally everything high and now I\u2019m sitting here sober and I\u2019m not too sure what to do with myself. I\u2019m gonna start by loving my girlfriend again, if you\u2019re going through something like I did listen to Rocket Man by Elton John, or the Ninja Sex Party cover ;), the lyrics really hit me and is what I credit getting sober to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now obviously this is really long and honestly is more for my well being than for your eyes but there is still way more to the story, any questions or comments are very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So, the past year I\u2019ve been going through a mental breakdown and it\u2019s finally coming to an end.

In June I wanted a \u201cmind high\u201d I wanted to think and I wanted to figure my mind out, I unlocked my mind and started to put the crazy puzzle together. In November I only wanted a body high. I started to actually hate smoking weed for a mind high, it made me sick to my stomach not remembering 3 days or acting normal. \n\nI finally decided enough was enough. I had two cuts of weed left and I decided I\u2019m smoking all of it up and never doing it again. So I did the thing that I felt would help me stop the best and that was to throw my bowl away for good. I didn\u2019t just put in it the garbage either, I did what any dramatic stoner would do and I threw it off of a mountain, at least a 75 foot drop, so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted by that thing ever again. \n\nSo that brings me to right now. I threw my bowl two days ago. I used to do literally everything high and now I\u2019m sitting here sober and I\u2019m not too sure what to do with myself. I\u2019m gonna start by loving my girlfriend again, if you\u2019re going through something like I did listen to Rocket Man by Elton John, or the Ninja Sex Party cover ;), the lyrics really hit me and is what I credit getting sober to. \n\nNow obviously this is really long and honestly is more for my well being than for your eyes but there is still way more to the story, any questions or comments are very welcome :)\n\n\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7haiar", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Another accomplishment, another step closer...", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7haiar", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7haiar/another_accomplishment_another_step_closer/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512346876.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7haiar/another_accomplishment_another_step_closer/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Asinjob", "created_utc": 1512318076.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work tomorrow for the first time in 2 weeks.

Never really thought of myself as not confident, just always thought I was a pretty sub-par individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had OCD and GAD since I was about 12. Can actually pinpoint the day my OCD began interestingly enough. Anyhow, definitely overall quite anxious an individual. Making good progress overall, a lot of my anxiety can be rather irrational/ridiculous but in my teens I had a fair bit of social anxiety in the context of relationships/opposite sex individuals. &lt;strong&gt;It completely disappeared around the age of 18. I reached a level of acceptance but with a negative assumption; I wasn&amp;#39;t ever going to be good enough.&lt;/strong&gt; My social anxiety essentially desintegrated, I stopped over-analysing social interactions/worrying about their implications and just having them. With the negative connotation that I wouldn&amp;#39;t ever be suitable for a relationship. I wasn&amp;#39;t even bothered by this for 4 years until recently; it was simply a fact; I wasn&amp;#39;t good enough. There was no more rumination or concern, heck I didn&amp;#39;t think about any of this almost the entire time. I was perfectly happy to just not have that part of my life exist. Of course my anxiety found other avenues but I developed perfectly fine social skills and really don&amp;#39;t lack any conversational ability regardless the individual. &lt;strong&gt;Unless it&amp;#39;s in a relationship/intimacy context. Then it all comes crashing back down, this happened once briefly 2 years ago but I slipped righhtttt back into my negative acceptance.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The messed up part&lt;/strong&gt;; is that this mostly no longer presents as just a feeling/doubt/worry/concern. In that moment I am simply not good enough, or it is simply impossible, I almost feel like I belong to a different echelon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a number of very short-lived relationships between 15-18 (3/4?) which combined with me having strong anxiety/OCD and back then not being very aware/mindful of it, meant I was the &lt;strong&gt;king&lt;/strong&gt; at over-thinking/micro-managing/worrying about doing things right instead of being in the moment and obviously this completely jeopardised all attempts. &lt;strong&gt;The conclusion? I simply can&amp;#39;t do anything right. I accepted it.&lt;/strong&gt; This literally allowed me to drop the idea altogether, a seemingly SIGNIFICANT aspect of any human being&amp;#39;s life, and not worry about it a bit. I was happy with my life, but this clearly wasn&amp;#39;t a very efficient long-term perspective, because I am someone who loves, who wants to love and be loved, who wants to share his existence with another. Someone who cares and wants to be cared for. To hold someone&amp;#39;s hand and just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily give a shit about the sex or the physicality. The abstract beauty in a human relationship is something I oh so value and long for. Yet I repressed it. &lt;strong&gt;Completely&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, I don&amp;#39;t lack any general social self-confidence at all. Talking to people of all shapes, sizes and ethnicity about anything outside of a &lt;em&gt;relationship/intimacy&lt;/em&gt; context is literally no sweat. The converse is not true, yet I haven&amp;#39;t experienced the converse in years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had two dreams in the past few months, very vivid and visceral alcohol REM-rebound influenced dreams where I lived some of those forgotten feelings. Where I fell in love. Where I experienced that part of my life. One of those dreams happened last night and just like the last it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve been thrust into a maelstrom of sadness/pessimism/submission as to a part of my life I have for years assumed could not exist. I feel like I&amp;#39;m lacking something so very valuable here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a wonderful girl today and I got a feeling in the pit of my stomach and chest that I haven&amp;#39;t had since I was probably 16. A feeling of inferiority, &lt;strong&gt;not even worried about being inferior, feeling genuinely inferior, being inferior&lt;/strong&gt;.

Never really thought of myself as not confident, just always thought I was a pretty sub-par individual.\n\nHad OCD and GAD since I was about 12. Can actually pinpoint the day my OCD began interestingly enough. Anyhow, definitely overall quite anxious an individual. Making good progress overall, a lot of my anxiety can be rather irrational/ridiculous but in my teens I had a fair bit of social anxiety in the context of relationships/opposite sex individuals. **It completely disappeared around the age of 18. I reached a level of acceptance but with a negative assumption; I wasn't ever going to be good enough.** My social anxiety essentially desintegrated, I stopped over-analysing social interactions/worrying about their implications and just having them. With the negative connotation that I wouldn't ever be suitable for a relationship. I wasn't even bothered by this for 4 years until recently; it was simply a fact; I wasn't good enough. There was no more rumination or concern, heck I didn't think about any of this almost the entire time. I was perfectly happy to just not have that part of my life exist. Of course my anxiety found other avenues but I developed perfectly fine social skills and really don't lack any conversational ability regardless the individual. **Unless it's in a relationship/intimacy context. Then it all comes crashing back down, this happened once briefly 2 years ago but I slipped righhtttt back into my negative acceptance.** \n\n**The messed up part**; is that this mostly no longer presents as just a feeling/doubt/worry/concern. In that moment I am simply not good enough, or it is simply impossible, I almost feel like I belong to a different echelon.\n\nI had a number of very short-lived relationships between 15-18 (3/4?) which combined with me having strong anxiety/OCD and back then not being very aware/mindful of it, meant I was the **king** at over-thinking/micro-managing/worrying about doing things right instead of being in the moment and obviously this completely jeopardised all attempts. **The conclusion? I simply can't do anything right. I accepted it.** This literally allowed me to drop the idea altogether, a seemingly SIGNIFICANT aspect of any human being's life, and not worry about it a bit. I was happy with my life, but this clearly wasn't a very efficient long-term perspective, because I am someone who loves, who wants to love and be loved, who wants to share his existence with another. Someone who cares and wants to be cared for. To hold someone's hand and just *be*. I don't necessarily give a shit about the sex or the physicality. The abstract beauty in a human relationship is something I oh so value and long for. Yet I repressed it. **Completely**. Again, I don't lack any general social self-confidence at all. Talking to people of all shapes, sizes and ethnicity about anything outside of a *relationship/intimacy* context is literally no sweat. The converse is not true, yet I haven't experienced the converse in years.\n\nI had two dreams in the past few months, very vivid and visceral alcohol REM-rebound influenced dreams where I lived some of those forgotten feelings. Where I fell in love. Where I experienced that part of my life. One of those dreams happened last night and just like the last it's like I've been thrust into a maelstrom of sadness/pessimism/submission as to a part of my life I have for years assumed could not exist. I feel like I'm lacking something so very valuable here.\n\nI saw a wonderful girl today and I got a feeling in the pit of my stomach and chest that I haven't had since I was probably 16. A feeling of inferiority, **not even worried about being inferior, feeling genuinely inferior, being inferior**. It's sickening, almost like a part of life that I to some extent believe I cannot obtain. This is a bit different to my usual mental woes so I thought I'd post up my experience and get some thoughts/feedback.\n\nThe reason I guess it happened is it was genuinely painful. I strived to be as socially optimal as I could and in doing so I was pathetic, I was anxious and it was genuinely painful, the amount of worry, the amount of rumination, the amount of uncertainty.\n\nPoor self-worth isn't something I've really ever thought about, in other domains I have solid confidence. I have learned in the last year that not all of our feelings or thoughts a) define us, b) are rational c) are meaningful/need to be acted upon, yet this one has been so untouched (and cemented in a negative acceptance which did have *some* benefits) that I'm not sure how to approach it.

I have this weird anxiety: my heart dies in nasty anticipation whenever I see a message in my inbox on any social media. It&amp;#39;s weird and I want to say it&amp;#39;s unique because I&amp;#39;ve never seen anyone else have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why I have it, I think, is because I once joined this anxiety support group on FB and the first post I commented on was about the use of hard drugs to help stave off anxiety. Some dude replied to me basically saying I was ignorant and apathetic toward drug users as he was a recovering user, then someone else, another rehaber, tried to listen to what I had to say about it until eventually I guess I ended up saying the wrong thing for both people and I quickly left the group, palms nearly dripping with sweat, chest tight and everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know now that I shouldn&amp;#39;t ever talk about drugs with anyone because I know next to nothing and yeah I probably sounded high-and-mighty and ignorant but to me, I was only going off simply what I knew and saw (idk if you can blame a (sheltered) kid who went through D.A.R.E in school). I think I was 20 at the time but the incident still affects me to this day (I&amp;#39;m 22 going on 23) and I&amp;#39;m constantly worried that someone/everyone will be as vicious as that person (then the depressive side of me thinks I totally deserve it). I&amp;#39;m also afraid of people thinking I&amp;#39;m condescending and rude when I truly don&amp;#39;t have those intentions.

I have this weird anxiety: my heart dies in nasty anticipation whenever I see a message in my inbox on any social media. It's weird and I want to say it's unique because I've never seen anyone else have it.\n\nThe reason why I have it, I think, is because I once joined this anxiety support group on FB and the first post I commented on was about the use of hard drugs to help stave off anxiety. Some dude replied to me basically saying I was ignorant and apathetic toward drug users as he was a recovering user, then someone else, another rehaber, tried to listen to what I had to say about it until eventually I guess I ended up saying the wrong thing for both people and I quickly left the group, palms nearly dripping with sweat, chest tight and everything.\n\nI know now that I shouldn't ever talk about drugs with anyone because I know next to nothing and yeah I probably sounded high-and-mighty and ignorant but to me, I was only going off simply what I knew and saw (idk if you can blame a (sheltered) kid who went through D.A.R.E in school). I think I was 20 at the time but the incident still affects me to this day (I'm 22 going on 23) and I'm constantly worried that someone/everyone will be as vicious as that person (then the depressive side of me thinks I totally deserve it). I'm also afraid of people thinking I'm condescending and rude when I truly don't have those intentions. I guess it's a deep-seated fear of rejection but I'm wondering if others have a similar anxiety/phobia and what they do about it.\n\n___\nAs for the former, I am terrible when it comes to meeting new people.

I&amp;#39;m currently seeing a therapist who is helping me mitigate and work through my issues but I would love to hear what advice this community might have for me because there are starting to be times that I&amp;#39;m just getting too scared of everything and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I apologize in advance if this might be distressing to some but I don't really know where else to turn right now.\n\nSo I've been working as a pharmacy tech for a chain retail pharmacy for about 3 months now and I absolutely hate it.

I can&amp;#39;t give details but long story short I have a love-hate-tramatized relationship with Skype, discord and video games. Kinda weird, I&amp;#39;m well aware. But the relationship has left me friendless for years, a lot of social anxiety, dependency issues and depression.\nNow my current boyfriend, when he isn&amp;#39;t at work or physically with me is always at home in a call on discord with his friends. This gives me a lot of anxiety and flashbacks even though I know the situation is completely different than my last.\nWhat I actually want/reality: I want to join his group of friends because we have now become a very serious relationship. We plan to spend the rest of our lives together. His friends can only be contacted via this discord group or texting cause they live all over the country and he has never actually met them in real life. The group is both guys, girls and even some other couples. There was a situation that I had a fall out with my boyfriend&amp;#39;s main best friends causing me to leave the group for a few weeks and I wrote them a long message asking for forgiveness and to be their friends/ join the group again. They said they were never mad at me, understand my issues and I didn&amp;#39;t need to say sorry for it. They even opened up to me about their issues and said I&amp;#39;m not alone. They also said I can join any time I feel comfortable, no permission needed. I am welcomed and I dont need to play games to be there and can just hang out. They want to be my friend too. I want to have a group I can rely on to always be there when im alone like my boyfriend has. I want to be able to hop in and out of chat whenever I feel like it and no one questions it like the rest of them can do. Clearly situations like this bring people happiness cause why else was my ex and current boyfriend choosing this over friends in person? This will also work well with my social anxiety. The other girls in the group aren&amp;#39;t a threat. No one else cares this much about all of this as I do. My boyfriend wants me in the group too but knows how much anxiety it brings me so he is kinda on the fence about it all. He doesn&amp;#39;t like me being upset. Plus I dont wanna just be there when he is online, I want to make them my own friends and to be able to hang out without my boyfriend there. Plus he will still have personal space cause I won&amp;#39;t always be online like he is...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What my anxiety tells me: Why am I forcing myself on to my boyfriend&amp;#39;s group of friends? They are not my friends and I need to stay in my lane. He will get annoyed with me spending too much time with him. I should just be alone like I have been and am used to being. Its so pathetic I&amp;#39;m joining my boyfriends group of friends instead of finding my own. I cant make my own friends because of my anxiety. This seems like my only choice right now and im so ashamed of it. Im so tired of being alone when im not with my boyfriend and i get really salty that he is never by himself. He is always talking to someone just like my ex was. Im so sacred he will choose them over me like my ex did. I will need permission from each one of them to join chat each time like my ex and his friends made me do. They will hate me and think I&amp;#39;m weird. I am very unwelcome and a fucking idiot for trying to make friends. I feel so stupid for sending the apology even though my boyfriend said it was the only way to fix the situation. They ended up saying it was unneeded so I made a big mistake. I asked to be friends like a 5 year old. I get jealous my boyfriend is always talking to other girls in the group all day every day when we don&amp;#39;t even text when we aren&amp;#39;t together. I cant play games like they do and if I cant do that then how can i ever relate to my boyfriend. My ex made me believe that if I wasn&amp;#39;t on the computer playing games then I was nothing. It&amp;#39;s odd, I know, but that&amp;#39;s how he abused me. I&amp;#39;m too boring and depressed to hold a conversation. Im unfriendable and  waist of space. I dont even play video games why am I even there. I asked to restart but I know my first impressions with them has been tainted cause of my anxiety. They pitty me. When I rejoined the group I quickly had a panic attack and my face went numb, my heart raced and my lips started to twitch. It&amp;#39;s like my body has PTSD and panics before my thoughts can even come into place. It ruins my day and makes my depression and anxiety worse but I know this will be my cure if I wasn&amp;#39;t so insane about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you see...I have all of these thoughts running in my head at the same time. All the time...i have many other issues but to me this one is most important. A lot of what I think contradicts each other. I believe both to be true like double think. Im at war with myself. I know that I am the only one holding myself back. I want to just give up and go away but my boyfriend tells me to not give in so easily and if this is what I want then I should go for it. He also said the only way i can disappoint him is by giving up. Being social like this will make me really happy...I just wish I can let go of the past. I dont know how to just be chill.

(It&amp;#39;s the 2nd game in the season). I tried to explain myself, telling her that I just felt really bummed and exhausted that day, and she kind&amp;#39;ve just dismissed everything I said.

Also &amp;quot;binural beats&amp;quot; are great for the brain to relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) watching funny  tv shows, or television you enjoy rather than some reality shows that you may feel sad, depressed or more dumb after watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) excercise!!

me always being super depressed &amp;amp; anxious and adding pTSD in there my room has always been a disaster. laundry not done. books from years ago not needed still piling up. once i dedicated to cleaning my space, doing my laundry. donating things i didnt need/use/wear anymore to those in need i instantly felt 100x better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;15) make your bed- this may sound silly, but after i started making my bed i feel so much better when i come home from a long day at work to find my bed made. it also motivates me in the morning to make it. cause i want it to look nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;16) Nature- try to spend sometime in nature everyday. whatever you enjoy and try to present in the moment and observe this wonderful planet (: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;17- leave your bedroom/house! - if you like to be alone most of the time &amp;amp; be in your room ( like me still trying to get out of this slowly but surely to become social lol ) you can still go to a museum alone, coffee shops alone, gyms, even a short walk will make you feel better&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;18- dress well- it doesnt matter your personal style or how much money you have. instead of wearing PJs all day even to go to starbucks, wear whatever you feel more confident in. a nicer put together outfit that isnt PJs this can also help your confidence, and lower your nerves a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;19- helping others- kindness is a big thing. volunteering, or just simply helping someone you know is in need, can be a big boost into countring - anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;these are some tips i have for now. ive felt alone my whole life. i wish i knew about reddit earlier. i hope this helps someone. i wish i had this forum earlier. it takes work but there is hope. i am so grateful for this community as it has helped me so much......&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "these are a few things that have helped me recently  and i wish someone has told me and i really hope it can help at least one person on here. this took me my whole life to learn as for the first time in 23 years of living i am finally learn to love myself. it is possible. there is light at the end of the tunnel. but we have to put in the work......\n\n\nthese are some tips i have for now. ive felt alone my whole life. i wish i knew about reddit earlier. i hope this helps someone. i wish i had this forum earlier. it takes work but there is hope. i am so grateful for this community as it has helped me so much......\n\n\n- i highly reccomend RALPH SMART/INFINITE WATERS on youtube as he was the one that has saved my life pretty much even if its via youtube.\n\n(about me : i struggle with depression, anxiety disorders my whole life, and PTSD. i am feeling better each and every day and this is what i do. each day i can feel myself feeling more and more anxiety/depression free. my symptons of PTSD are starting to lessen as well. )\n\n\"wealth is in the mind, control your mind/thoughts control your life\"\n\n1) eating clean as possible.

I am sort of new to this anxiety and panic attacks. I just need a place to vent. And last night while trying to sleep and failing I found this place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had anxiety before, but it was due to exams in college and high-school. But it was never this severe. Not even when I was bullied in middle school or when my father was a drunk. I was depressed a few times, but I knew it was depression and that it was going to pass and what to do in order to pass by it. And the last time I was depressed was in September and it was a quick but severe depression, that passed. But about that last depression. I am a writer, I write short stories for my blog and I write books. The last time I got depressed was when I started the third book. Due to it being set in my past about exes and traumatic moments where I either was broken up with by my first love, cheated on or trying to console with everything that happened in the past. But with that I slowly got depressed and got into writers block. Which only made things worse. And with that, I had to postpone the book for next year. Which fucked me up more. Because the first two books I wrote in a few weeks. And now it sort of made me lose my mojo. That and the fact that I had to do everything since I was my own publisher, editor and marketing agent. After all that passed, my uncle died, and with that I inherited an apartment. That added more pressure, because I work a full time job on a 350 dollar salary (that&amp;#39;s the minimum wage in the country I am from). And that apartment needs a lot of work, being old and never being refurbished. With a stinky old bathroom, stinky bedroom, filthy kitchen and a lot of crap to do. So I started buying furniture, a washing machine and things to refurbish it. But with my wage, it&amp;#39;s way too little to do it all at once. Which brought me more anxiety. That and the fact that I had a fight with my father and he threatened me to throw me out of the house. The next morning I had my first panic attack. And since then it&amp;#39;s been a rollercoaster of panic attacks and anxiety. I had to go to a cardiologist for her to tell me that nothing is wrong with me and that I should exercise. The thing is, I do not have the time working 12 hour shifts and writing at the job or at home. And I can&amp;#39;t afford to quit my job, since I need the money. So every since I started having these panic attacks, it&amp;#39;s very hard to do anything. And with every panic attack I learn something new, for example that I hyperventilated last night. And that the panic attack can manifest in different ways, it isn&amp;#39;t always the same way. What bothers me is that I feel fine physically, that if there&amp;#39;s nothing stressing me, I suddenly feel anxious or panic overflowing. Or that every muscle in my body gets very tense suddenly. Or that my heart starts beating really fast and then I think that there&amp;#39;s something wrong with me. And at this point I do not know what to do anymore. I am watching my breathing, I am moving as much as I can with light exercise, the medication that was given to me (it was something from plants to calm me down and it worked at first, even if it was like a placebo effect). So now every time I get anxious and panicked I have to deal with it on my own. Even if I talk to someone and tell them what&amp;#39;s going on, it doesn&amp;#39;t really help. It&amp;#39;s more like I am just notifying someone of my problem and then continue having the problem.

I can&amp;#39;t concentrate, I will likely cry, rage, need to get up from my chair and wander around aimlessly, call a friend etc. to try to make room inside. Being away from my work also feels like avoidance, so even in the temporary relief there is suffering. I can&amp;#39;t usually eat lunch because of the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2-4 pm (anxiety 0-2) - At some point, the anxiety subsides almost as by the flick of a switch. I can think clearly, have perspective and typically take on a very positive attitude. I&amp;#39;m a different person; I can&amp;#39;t understand what has been tormenting me for the past 6 or so hours. The anxious thoughts that seemed so scary just minutes / hours ago are still there, but they&amp;#39;ve lost their power. I have peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest of the day (anxiety 0-4) - The earlier bout of anxiety has exhausted me, and I start eating comfort food and don&amp;#39;t want to do any exercise; I just want to enjoy the bliss of not giving a fuck that has been bestowed upon me for god knows what reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, after a day like this, I can say to myself &amp;quot;Okay, there it was again.

I&amp;#39;ve made it before and it was fine and tasty, but for some reason this time I was more worried about the chance of e coli.  Probably because our butcher was closed so I had to go to Whole Foods so I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the beef would be of the same quality.  The beef was grass fed and the butcher at Whole Foods assured me he had eaten it raw many times.  To be fair, there was no evidence that my butcher&amp;#39;s beef was grass fed, only that it was vegetarian fed, so for all I know the Whole Foods beef was safer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to be safe, I bathed the piece of meat in salt and vinegar for about half an hour in the fridge before cutting and serving.  I feel fine at this point, physically, but it hasn&amp;#39;t even been 24 hr since consumption and the incubation period is more likely to be about 3-4 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t stop worrying that my husband and I are going to get seriously ill and die because of this.

I've made it before and it was fine and tasty, but for some reason this time I was more worried about the chance of e coli.  Probably because our butcher was closed so I had to go to Whole Foods so I wasn't sure if the beef would be of the same quality.  The beef was grass fed and the butcher at Whole Foods assured me he had eaten it raw many times.  To be fair, there was no evidence that my butcher's beef was grass fed, only that it was vegetarian fed, so for all I know the Whole Foods beef was safer.\n\nJust to be safe, I bathed the piece of meat in salt and vinegar for about half an hour in the fridge before cutting and serving.  I feel fine at this point, physically, but it hasn't even been 24 hr since consumption and the incubation period is more likely to be about 3-4 days.\n\nI can't stop worrying that my husband and I are going to get seriously ill and die because of this.

I no longer cried or had panic attacks in class, but I did have my moments. I threw a chair at a guy once (but honestly he deserved it. He was being a huge jerk. XD) I had friends. I no longer felt like there was something wrong with me. But I did still feel on edge almost constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is when shit hits the fan. My cousin committed suicide when I was twelve. He was about twenty. Six months later, my anxiety got a lot worse. I was on edge so much that the times I wasn&amp;#39;t felt like depression. I started getting paranoid. I was just so done with it all. I had been dealing with the anxiety for six years, almost as long as I could remember. I self-diagnosed myself with borderline personality disorder. I contemplated suicide. I decided that I was going to overdose on my acne medication (which I would later find out cannot kill you). I confided these feelings with my friends, who told the school. I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to return to school until I got help. I started seeing my therapist again, who finally diagnosed me with GAD and started prescribing Zoloft. It helped me so much. I was still on edge, but drastically less so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;High school was wonderfully uneventful apart from the usual stressors of taking advanced placement courses and socializing. I still saw my therapist from time to time, and sometimes I thought things would get bad again, but nothing was consistently bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I am a freshman in college with my first trimester under my belt (my college is on trimesters I know it&amp;#39;s weird.) I struggled a lot with realizing that I actually had to attend class and do the homework. The biggest thing was that I stopped taking my medications, and I found that everything was okay (I do still have some if I find that I need to resume taking them.) I also met a guy who also had GAD. I thought I found a good friend (and I definitely had some romantic feelings,) but the relationship became emotionally abusive. He was manipulative and blamed me for all of our problems to the point that I thought I possibly had bipolar disorder; however, my friends and the school counseling center helped me work up the courage to cut him out of my life for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so currently I am in a good place with good friends and looking forward to my second trimester. If you take anything from this, I hope you learn that everything bad will come to pass. Things aren&amp;#39;t going to be hard forever, and it&amp;#39;s okay to ask for help when they do get rough.

And now, I&amp;#39;m just so empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last November, I was rear-ended on my way to work.  It was a fairly serious 3-car incident, though no one was injured.  My car was at the front, hit last, suffered the most damage, but was incredibly intact.  I had one of the worst panic attacks I have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One driver insisted it was my fault, even though they were the one to first hit the car that slammed into me.  The other driver defended me to the police officer, which I was thankful for because I was extremely unnerved and intimidated.  Previous traumatic instances in my life makes it very difficult to defend myself against aggressors, handle intimidation, and speak with police, but eventually I was able to drive my car home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I could just get my car fixed and move on with my life.  I spent weeks on the phone trying to get it figured out.  I was found not at fault, but I was unable to get my car fixed.  Their insurance was a joke, and they treated me like complete garbage.  In the end, they offered me a monetary settlement that would have left me still in debt to the bank and without a car or any resources to continue to get to my job.  The whole situation became too much, and after a terrible conversation with the insurance agent where I tried to assert myself, I decided to give the fight up.  Weeks had turned to months and I was tired.  Too many tears.  Too much anger.  Too much anxiety.  I would get it fixed my own way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not before getting struck again less than a month later.  I was rear-ended on a snowy day.  The damage to my car was slightly worse, but once again, no one was hurt and my car was drivable.  The other driver had barely a paint scratch.  With the extensive damage to my car already, there was nothing to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not drive myself home this time.  At the moment I was struck, I screamed terribly loud until my lungs were empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to commute most days of the week, so I fought through my discomfort and got behind the wheel the next day.  Things got better, but then over the course of this year, it all got much, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly it has just been chipping away at me.  First, I was more fearful when traffic would slow and cause me to slow; the circumstances surrounding the last accidents.  I eventually stopped agreeing to do any extra driving whatsoever.  Now, I only drive myself to work, and every day it is pure hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leave unreasonably early for work to avoid high traffic, but the entire time, I am at the edge of my seat, grinding my fists against the steering wheel until my palms burn.  I drive a little slower every day, becoming the kind of driver I foolishly used to criticise.  Nothing feels normal or safe.  On my way home, I hit rush hour traffic, and I have frequent, sometimes constant panic attacks.  My anxiety slowly rises throughout the day as I get closer to leaving, and it climaxes in a commute of sheer misery.  It is very painful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I hit a squirrel.  I almost posted here that day because of how much it broke me.  I love small animals so much, especially delightful forest critters.  Everyone tells me that it is sad, but it just happens sometimes.  I know they are right, but I am still broken.  As safe and careful as I try to be, I feel absolutely powerless on the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just last night, my SO was trying to help me get to the roots of my fear, as it is very clearly disrupting a huge portion of my life.  I cried, revealing that I feel like I am in constant danger.  This morning, I realized it is because I see the whole driving process as utterly unpredictable and so fragile.  I feel like the universe I am in and the universe where I get in a terrible wreck are divided only by a thin fabric that could tear at any moment.  I put a bracelet my friend made me around the mirror, hoping it would keep me safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the fabric tore.  Again.  My partner was driving, and we stopped as we needed to make a left turn onto the main road.  As we were waiting for an opportunity, a car I did not see struck us from behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That impact.  The car rocks forward.  The sound of metal slamming into metal.  It shook me to the core.  I was out of breath before I even realized what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My SO pulled in across the street as I fell to pieces.  I wailed for longer than I know.  I was lost in time, lost to my terror, my biggest fears, for what felt like an eternity.  The other driver took off, leaving me in the dark parking lot, screaming in my partners arms.  I begged the universe to take it away.  My SO could say almost nothing at first, knowing I was on the brink every day I got in the virtually impossible act of me getting hit again had just happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could barely breathe when we finally decided to head home.  Miraculously, my car seems fine.  Once again, I get away safe, but no justice, promise of future security, or soul.  I sat there and cried more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner said to me, &amp;#39;Do you remember in V for Vendetta when Evey finds out it was V who was holding her captive?  She was at her absolute lowest, beaten down to nothing, but she had to choose to face it.  &amp;quot;Listen to me, Evey.  This could be the most important moment of your life.  Commit to it.&amp;quot;  You have to walk away from this.  I can&amp;#39;t watch you get knocked down another peg.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel pretty broken up right now.  For months I have been trying to soothe myself with promises that I am safe and I can handle it, and that was ripped away from me.  It is fortunate that no one has been hurt, but I suffer a great deal from all this.  I am tired of being so painstakingly afraid every day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read all of this, thank you so much.  I really needed to get this out of me.  I am in far less agony than when I started.  Just tired from the worst panic attack I&amp;#39;ve ever had, and all this flipping terrible driving.

At the moment I was struck, I screamed terribly loud until my lungs were empty.\n\nI had to commute most days of the week, so I fought through my discomfort and got behind the wheel the next day.  Things got better, but then over the course of this year, it all got much, much worse.\n\nSlowly it has just been chipping away at me.  First, I was more fearful when traffic would slow and cause me to slow; the circumstances surrounding the last accidents.  I eventually stopped agreeing to do any extra driving whatsoever.  Now, I only drive myself to work, and every day it is pure hell.\n\nI leave unreasonably early for work to avoid high traffic, but the entire time, I am at the edge of my seat, grinding my fists against the steering wheel until my palms burn.  I drive a little slower every day, becoming the kind of driver I foolishly used to criticise.  Nothing feels normal or safe.  On my way home, I hit rush hour traffic, and I have frequent, sometimes constant panic attacks.  My anxiety slowly rises throughout the day as I get closer to leaving, and it climaxes in a commute of sheer misery.  It is very painful.\n\nA few weeks ago, I hit a squirrel.  I almost posted here that day because of how much it broke me.  I love small animals so much, especially delightful forest critters.  Everyone tells me that it is sad, but it just happens sometimes.  I know they are right, but I am still broken.  As safe and careful as I try to be, I feel absolutely powerless on the road.\n\nJust last night, my SO was trying to help me get to the roots of my fear, as it is very clearly disrupting a huge portion of my life.  I cried, revealing that I feel like I am in constant danger.  This morning, I realized it is because I see the whole driving process as utterly unpredictable and so fragile.  I feel like the universe I am in and the universe where I get in a terrible wreck are divided only by a thin fabric that could tear at any moment.  I put a bracelet my friend made me around the mirror, hoping it would keep me safe.\n\nTonight, the fabric tore.  Again.  My partner was driving, and we stopped as we needed to make a left turn onto the main road.  As we were waiting for an opportunity, a car I did not see struck us from behind.\n\nThat impact.  The car rocks forward.  The sound of metal slamming into metal.  It shook me to the core.  I was out of breath before I even realized what had happened.\n\nMy SO pulled in across the street as I fell to pieces.  I wailed for longer than I know.  I was lost in time, lost to my terror, my biggest fears, for what felt like an eternity.  The other driver took off, leaving me in the dark parking lot, screaming in my partners arms.  I begged the universe to take it away.  My SO could say almost nothing at first, knowing I was on the brink every day I got in the virtually impossible act of me getting hit again had just happened.\n\nI could barely breathe when we finally decided to head home.  Miraculously, my car seems fine.  Once again, I get away safe, but no justice, promise of future security, or soul.  I sat there and cried more.\n\nMy partner said to me, 'Do you remember in V for Vendetta when Evey finds out it was V who was holding her captive?  She was at her absolute lowest, beaten down to nothing, but she had to choose to face it.  \"Listen to me, Evey.  This could be the most important moment of your life.  Commit to it.\"  You have to walk away from this.  I can't watch you get knocked down another peg.'\n\nI feel pretty broken up right now.  For months I have been trying to soothe myself with promises that I am safe and I can handle it, and that was ripped away from me.  It is fortunate that no one has been hurt, but I suffer a great deal from all this.  I am tired of being so painstakingly afraid every day of my life.\n\nIf you read all of this, thank you so much.  I really needed to get this out of me.  I am in far less agony than when I started.  Just tired from the worst panic attack I've ever had, and all this flipping terrible driving.

To be clear, I have worried about this topic previously in my life, but usually after freaking out about it for awhile (a couple of hours?) usually when I\u2019m trying to go to sleep or am awake and alone at night, I would calm myself down and be okay and not think about it again for a good while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, many things have happened in the past couple of weeks that I think have triggered a extreme bout of death phobia and anxiety in me. My boyfriend just turned 24  on Thanksgiving. I turn 23 next Tuesday. One of my rescue dogs turns 9 the same week. My 18 year old little brother, who I\u2019ve been taking care of for awhile, announced he was moving out on Thanksgiving and left the same day, and (since graduating college in May) I am starting my first professional level job on Monday. As you can see, a lot is going on in my life right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several nights ago, I was up late watching tv while my boyfriend was asleep. He\u2019d had a long day at work and was very tired. My dogs were laying next to me. First I started thinking about how much I love my boyfriend. We\u2019ve been together for five years and our relationship is actually right now the best it\u2019s ever been. During those five years we\u2019ve gone through a lot together, financially, physically, emotionally. I started looking at our rescue pets, and started thinking about how much I love them, how much better they make my life, and then of course I thought........&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALL OF THIS IS TEMPORARY AND MY BOYFRIEND AND MY PETS ARE GOING TO DIE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has happened before, when death creeps into my otherwise pleasant thoughts. This time I wasn\u2019t able to think about something more pleasant. This time even though I tried giving in and thinking about it for awhile (that my dogs will likely be dead in the next few years, that years don\u2019t even last that long, that my boyfriend and I won\u2019t be together \u201cforever\u201d that we\u2019re actually all alone in death, that death is terrifying because \u201chow can I just not BE anymore\u201d, that doing anything is pointless because a generation or two after I die no one will give a shit about me or my boyfriend, even though we\u2019re good people who try to do good things, what if the Christians are right about heaven and hell and I\u2019m killed before I can convert, and I could go on and on and on but basically just imagine every negative thing associated with death and I thought it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After letting myself think about it for awhile, I realized that something was different. I\u2019m a very anxious person- I grew up in a not so great household, abusive, never had money, etc. So I was always anxious/stressed out about that. That kind of anxiousness went on through high school, and then when I left for college I was always stressed out about school, money, etc. Of course, my stress isn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d stress-though I haven\u2019t been diagnosed I am thinking that I have some level of anxiety. I overthink simple things, work myself up a lot, etc. But usually it\u2019s manageable enough. Not this time though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For hours I stayed up, hysterical, googling things like \u201cwhat happens after you die\u201d \u201cI\u2019m scared of dying\u201d etc and honestly I really regret these searches as it only showed me responses from people who were also letting the fear consume them, like I was. It was nice to have my fears validated as a commonplace occurrence, but honestly many comments just made more points about how futile life is and how terrifying death is when I really needed help in stopping those kind of thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up having a panic attack that night. I thought I was going to pass out. It\u2019s been years and years since I\u2019ve had one. I was physically sick, violently crying, and woke my boyfriend up and tried to tell him what was going on. He tried to help me as best he could, but he didn\u2019t fully understand why I was worrying about such a thing-being so young and all. I\u2019d never told him about my previous instances of death anxiety. Also, he was very tired and had work the next morning at 4, so he couldn\u2019t exactly stay up and talk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Days later, this extreme anxiety hasn\u2019t subsided at all. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s different this time because of the transition phase in my life right now. But now I am very mentally sick, that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cannot enjoy anything anymore. I can\u2019t enjoy food, because if it\u2019s not healthy I can only think about how I\u2019m killing my boyfriend and I by eating toxic shit and reducing our life span. I can\u2019t enjoy spending time with my dogs, I literally can\u2019t look at them without almost crying\nbecause I know my time with them is extremely short, and they\u2019re such good dogs and I love them so incredibly much that it hurts. But I look at them and see impending death. Same thing with my boyfriend. We\u2019re getting married in a couple of months, and I desperately want to be excited about it, but now I just feel sick. If we live long lives we have like what, fifty more anniversaries together? That used to sound like a long time to me. Now it sounds like no time at all. Like not enough time I mean. And with starting work full time soon I\u2019m also terrified of losing even more of the precious time I have left with my loved ones because of a 40 hour workweek. The only time this week I\u2019ve been able to stop thinking like this was when my boyfriend and I were having sex. And even then, afterwards I thought \u201chow many more times will we be able to do that before we die?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that everyone dies and that I can\u2019t stop death. I know that. I know that I\u2019m young and healthy enough and all that. I know that stressing over something so inevitable is a horrible use of the limited time I keep going on and on about. I just can\u2019t stop. And I\u2019m so worried about how this anxiety is going to affect my work life and relationship. This week I\u2019ve been very clingy to my boyfriend, begging him to be very careful on the road, basically crying every time I look at him. I won\u2019t say that it\u2019s irritated him, but it\u2019s more like it\u2019s disturbed him. Especially when I was petting my dogs belly and said out loud \u201cI wonder how many more times I\u2019ll be able to do this\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve also been talking a lot about religion because that\u2019s been bothering me too. We were both raised in religious households but became agnostics/atheists a few years ago. I keep wondering to boyfriend about whether or not we should try to find some sort of religion again. Even though I know it\u2019d be hard for me to not be cynical, I feel like my mental health would be better if I thought that I\u2019d be with him again in an afterlife. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, when I am around many people I feel better, but for a weird reason. Earlier tonight I was in Walmart with my boyfriend and when I looked around at all the people, I thought \u201cHm. They\u2019re all going to die one day too, and they probably worry about it like I do.\u201d And then I was kind of comforted for awhile, only to have the same thoughts creep back up at me as soon as we got home and went to bed (right now).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I start to have an enjoyable time with my boyfriend and dogs, I immediately am overwhelmed by a feeling of hopelessness, because I know that it\u2019s all temporary and I can\u2019t be with them forever. And I want to. I don\u2019t necessarily care about living forever, but I do not want to be away from him/them. I can\u2019t go on with these kinds of thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that there will be some suggestions to get professional help, and as soon as my health insurance kicks in I plan to....even though I\u2019m also anxious about that, because I feel like I\u2019ll be wasting precious hours of my life trying to fix a problem I should be able to fix at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. I\u2019m depressed and anxious, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about the impending death of my loved ones and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how scary it is to \u201cnot be\u201d anymore. I don\u2019t want to live like this. Please help me, or point me in the direction of help, if you can.

I don\u2019t wanna sound like a dumb kid but I\u2019m terrified of getting blood work done, and I really need to do this; the need to do this isn\u2019t winning out over the sheer terror of having to go get drawn.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Work/Search", "id": "7gto1l", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Getting medical work done", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "workflair", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gto1l", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7gto1l/getting_medical_work_done/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512144334.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7gto1l/getting_medical_work_done/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Bellsie", "created_utc": 1512115534.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=\"/r/Anxiety\"&gt;r/Anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one of my best friends deals with a lot of Anxiety and she&amp;#39;s always sick because of it.

I want to leave because maybe she'll try to come and help but she doesn't SEEM to care when i do, and if i leave then i have literally no one to even try to talk to :( im so broken, i was so happy and then ruined by the same person.. and i somehow still love her so much.\n\nEDIT: i forgot to add that she seems way too interested around my best friend (even though he has a girlfriend) and this can make me insanely jealous.. as i wish it was me\nI've also had a few arguments in out total group chat with her, causing all of my friends to side with her and all shout at me\n\nI'm currently mid argument with her and shes gone to a dance class, i dont know what to say whens shes back :(", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7gotkt", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My current situation :(", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 10, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1512070031.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gotkt", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7gotkt/my_current_situation/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512098401.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7gotkt/my_current_situation/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "tomhaffisaperson", "created_utc": 1512069601.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "DAE Questions", "id": "7gpsda", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Does anyone else live anxiety without anyone else knowing, so you can\u2019t do what you really want to do like break down and cry, even before your family and friends?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "daeflair", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gpsda", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7gpsda/does_anyone_else_live_anxiety_without_anyone_else/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512106216.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7gpsda/does_anyone_else_live_anxiety_without_anyone_else/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "chloeeee233", "created_utc": 1512077416.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have trouble with eating when they&amp;#39;re anxious?

I have been making confession, and yesterday a priest presented me an interesting perspective: that it is not the Holy Spirit or God who is bringing me desolation, but rather an evil spirit which sees me trying to be holy, so it is challenging me. This does give me hope and temporarily gave me much confidence, however the latter feels almost gone as it has before. \n\nSo, I know you all are not priests, so I am not asking you advice from a religious perspective (although it is most certainly welcome if you have it). Has anyone felt what I'm feeling and have any advice? \n\nAlso, I have found lately that I often turn to drugs such as alcohol or nicotine or adderall for consolation and fun, but I have this suspicion that these only exaggerate my odd mental state, but is even harder to combat because my body naturally wants these because it will possibly make me feel better in the short term. \n\nThank you for reading ", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Advice", "id": "7gnnfd", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Emotional/Anxiety Issues?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qmij", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "adviceflair", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7gnnfd", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Anxiety/comments/7gnnfd/emotionalanxiety_issues/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512089213.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7gnnfd/emotionalanxiety_issues/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Ireland14", "created_utc": 1512060413.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Anxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.Anxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "Anxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been going on for years now.

Sadly, though, the fact that I spent so much time smoking is wreaking havoc on my health anxiety (I do have GAD and always feel kind of worried, even on my medication: 20mg of Celexa daily - health is just what gets me kicked into obsessive fits).\n\nIve now noticed this breathing symptom a few times and I want to see if any of you have had the same experience?\n\nSometimes (not too often) when I breathe ill be done exhaling, but there will still be a breathing sound/breath coming out. When I inhale, the inverse happens the same way. It's more that I can feel it than hear it, but I can definitely feel and hear it. It's NOT a whistle like a wheeze, it's more like the air is still getting squeezed out and hasn't fully emptied yet. Like there's something blocking the air I guess? Almost a droning feeling, like a bagpipe or an accordion, if that helps get my point across?\n\nDoes this sound familiar?\n\nAlso, I know you're all going to say go to the doctor and I get that!

My friend gave me a pill (stupid high school stuff) and I just remember how calm I was. I didn't have anxiety back then like I have now. Which is why I am very excited to get this medication, because I know it is going to really help me. \n\n\n\nAnyone else have experience with buspirone? My doctor started me out on 7.5mg twice, daily. Although, I heard you can go up to 60mg daily. I've heard of people not feeling anything on 7.5 mg, but larger doses the medication helped them a lot.\n\n\n\nI am just very excited to start trying to medication tomorrow. I am afraid of antidepressants, propranolol doesn't work, xanax, valium, ativan, etc. don't work too well either (I still have a script of 15 for very bad panic attacks however). I changed my diet, take vitamins, exercise, started meditating, and really started trying to better myself  and focus on myself. Yet, my anxiety is still present. Social anxiety mostly. But I feel as if my social anxiety causes me to have general anxiety. \n\n\nAnyone else have experience with buspirone?

Having recently come out of a relationship that ended in the total blindsided abandonment that has been cutely deemed \u201cghosting\u201d by my generation, the last thing I wanted to do was feel vulnerable in front of another man ever again. But then my friends forced me to get Bumble, get tipsy enough to swipe though roughly fifteen guys our beer goggles deemed hot enough, and I reluctantly set up one date I had every intention of cancelling. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except I forgot, until two hours beforehand. And while I do have a somewhat notorious reputation in my friend group for being a bit of a heartless bitch (it comes with the territory when you\u2019re a cute 26 year-old female lawyer in the old boys club, who was largely raised by a progressive and brilliant single dad), I knew cancelling THAT late was rude as hell. So I made the most minimal effort possible, and walked into a date I mentally deemed a failure even before I got out of my car. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy was fine, and for purposes of this post we can call him Jared. He was sweet, and cute, and talked about his career and hobbies in a way that made me want to find anything in life I loved that much.  However, coming out of a relationship of intense passion and constant drunken escapades of a grand scale, everything felt a little flat and I left feeling fairly indifferent about a possible date number two. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I did feel was a new confidence to date all of Los Angeles. Over the next few months I continued to go on a stream of first dates with every form of bad boy in the metro area, all of which resulted in vague promises to see each other again that never amounted to anything. The one thing that remained was Jared. He was never there an obtrusive amount, but he also failed to ever let more than a few days pass without interjecting himself into my life in some little way. He remembered everything I told him about myself, and he always had a way of making me feel like the most important person in the room every time he looked at me. But I dismissed his intentions to a degree. At the time I justified my reluctance to open up to Jared as a knee-jerk reaction to his constant eagerness to understand me, but in retrospective I was probably just terrified.

But where Jared was so steadfast in knowing he wanted me and only me, I felt a distinct fear in the same knowledge; and for as much as he should have many times over, Jared never gave up on me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then everything changed. I can\u2019t put into words how and why, because honestly the thought of typing out our story is still too much for me to even consider.

Our relationship wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was built on selflessness and a kind of careful understanding that I\u2019ve never experienced in my entire life. It was painfully real, in a way that still causes me an immense amount of fear knowing I might never see that kind of love again. I allowed Jared to see vulnerabilities I didn\u2019t even know existed, and I never felt more secure in anything than knowing that he would be a constant fixture in my future.

I can still mentally replay everything about the day Jared left me. A week earlier he cried to me over the phone, explaining that he had a chronic anxiety disorder that cohabited with depressive episodes- one of which had just presented itself in full-force. He pleaded with me to forgive him for not telling me sooner, which just seemed to me to be misplaced concern when all I could spend my energy on was helping provide him the support I knew he would have shown me had the roles been reversed. But despite my best efforts to reassure him that my feelings were unconditional and my fear about our future together non-existent, I wasn\u2019t enough. The man who worshiped me from the day we met ended the relationship we had built on mutual respect over a text message. A text message sent a mere six hours after I went alone to a medical procedure where he had promised to come to provide emotional and physical support. A text message sent three days before we were scheduled to go on our first vacation together. A text message sent nine days before I turned 27. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jared explained that he and his therapist agreed that time alone to sort through his own emotional blocks, ones I didn\u2019t even know existed, was necessary. But the last time I checked, he was in a relationship with me- not a doctor who had entered his life a week prior. When I tried to talk to him about the break, all he could tell me was he didn\u2019t know what he wanted. Nothing about our conversation made sense, he went back and forth between telling me he had been considering leaving me for some time and also saying the decision came about so abruptly that he didn\u2019t have time to warn me. I used every tactic I could think of to convince him that his constrain suggestions that I deserved better than him were wrong, and that no decision of this magnitude should be made during a time of such great pain. But most of what I said went ignored, and the rest was met with little acknowledgement and no detectable traces of empathy. He completely denied me any opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue about our relationship, and left me feeling a form of abandonment I didn\u2019t even know existed- one that demonstrated to me that from his current perspective no aspect of our relationship was even worth trying to save. But the worst part was, I didn\u2019t even have a target to direct all my feelings of abandonment, resentment, and anger towards. Because this isn\u2019t him. I\u2019m not dealing with my equal partner, but I\u2019m still dealing with very real and painful consequences of the actions his brain has convinced him are logical and protective. What scares me even more is knowing that I will always, on some level, hope the man I loved comes back to himself and eventually back to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m an exceedingly bright person and I fully acknowledge so many standby responses to this situation. I understand that he doesn\u2019t want to be so desperate and confused about his mindset. I get that I should consider myself lucky that a shared house, marriage, or family wasn\u2019t impacted. I know that even if he survives this tragic episode of his life, revisiting a relationship might be too much for him or that even despite hard work by both of us it just won\u2019t look the same moving forward. I acknowledge that this will be a part of his person forever, but also wholly discern that dealing with this reality is much less fearful than a life without him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve reached out to him a couple times over the course of the past few months that we\u2019ve been apart, always clearly stating that a response isn\u2019t necessary unless he ever decides it to be in his best emotional and mental interest. In doing so I know I\u2019m somewhat robbing myself of the opportunity to fully move on, but the thought of him working through this completely alone is far too much for me to live with. We have varying levels of darkness in our lives, but being strong for him is easy because he has already been the epitome of comfort for me in some of my hardest days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not completely certain why I\u2019m throwing this narrative into the vast void of the Internet, seeing as I\u2019ve yet to find comfort in thousands of other words from every source imaginable. Maybe I just need to know that I\u2019m not alone, or hear that someone else can hear the hurt in my words and understand it would take an especially different kind of person to create those kinds of emotional wounds. But what I think more than anything is that I need reassurance that having hope in love and the strength of our bond is not foolish, no matter how much it can feel that way sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I didn\u2019t want to be in love, in fact I didn\u2019t even want to date. Having recently come out of a relationship that ended in the total blindsided abandonment that has been cutely deemed \u201cghosting\u201d by my generation, the last thing I wanted to do was feel vulnerable in front of another man ever again. But then my friends forced me to get Bumble, get tipsy enough to swipe though roughly fifteen guys our beer goggles deemed hot enough, and I reluctantly set up one date I had every intention of cancelling. \n\nExcept I forgot, until two hours beforehand. And while I do have a somewhat notorious reputation in my friend group for being a bit of a heartless bitch (it comes with the territory when you\u2019re a cute 26 year-old female lawyer in the old boys club, who was largely raised by a progressive and brilliant single dad), I knew cancelling THAT late was rude as hell. So I made the most minimal effort possible, and walked into a date I mentally deemed a failure even before I got out of my car. \n\nThe guy was fine, and for purposes of this post we can call him Jared. He was sweet, and cute, and talked about his career and hobbies in a way that made me want to find anything in life I loved that much.  However, coming out of a relationship of intense passion and constant drunken escapades of a grand scale, everything felt a little flat and I left feeling fairly indifferent about a possible date number two. \n\nWhat I did feel was a new confidence to date all of Los Angeles. Over the next few months I continued to go on a stream of first dates with every form of bad boy in the metro area, all of which resulted in vague promises to see each other again that never amounted to anything. The one thing that remained was Jared. He was never there an obtrusive amount, but he also failed to ever let more than a few days pass without interjecting himself into my life in some little way. He remembered everything I told him about myself, and he always had a way of making me feel like the most important person in the room every time he looked at me. But I dismissed his intentions to a degree. At the time I justified my reluctance to open up to Jared as a knee-jerk reaction to his constant eagerness to understand me, but in retrospective I was probably just terrified.

The 1% of your thoughts that actually serve a practical use are the ability to understand knowledge, and problem solving. Anxious and negative thinking (for example: i hate my life, I hate myself, what if??, who, what, when, why how...) are part of the 99% of useless thoughts. They serve NO MEANING.

We obsess, reminisce, and interact with these negative thoughts, and interacting with these negative thoughts too much bring out negative emotions such as depression, anger, guilt, shame, etc. I can support this first handedly, because my depression rose from my anxiety, from me thinking too much about the way I act, and beating myself down.

Anxiety causes you to focus inwards towards your thoughts, practicing these 2 things bring your attention outwards towards the world instead of your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation is important because it teaches you to become an observer of your thoughts. Practice makes perfect. Doing meditation once a day, for 5-15 minutes can help train your mind to stop interacting with your negative thoughts. With practice, you learn to just observe your thoughts and let them be. Don&amp;#39;t interact, don&amp;#39;t agree, don&amp;#39;t disagree, just acknowledging that the negative thought exists, and just let it go. It becomes muscle memory. Remember, these thoughts serve no practical meaning, but how we choose to interact with these thoughts, can make a difference. Practicing meditation is simple. Lay down in whatever position is comfortable, take deep breaths, feel the air going through your body, feel the weight of your body, and become relaxed. Whenever you notice your mind wandering off, bring your attention back. Don&amp;#39;t interact with them. Imagine you&amp;#39;re sitting on the side of the road on a freeway, your thoughts are the cars. Don&amp;#39;t go running into the road trying to stop the cars, slow them down, or catch them, just watch. And keep doing this, when you notice when your mind wanders, bring your attention back to your breathing. There&amp;#39;s many resources online all about how to meditate, how to breathe deeply, it&amp;#39;s benefits, etc...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Awareness is all about bringing your attention outwards towards the world. When you&amp;#39;re going through anxiety, you get too lost in your thoughts, to the point of being unaware of your surroundings. This brings your attention back. Pay close attention to all your senses. Can you feel your eyes reading the letters across the screen? Do you feel the weight of your body wherever you&amp;#39;re sitting/standing/laying? Spending time outdoors like hiking, going to beaches has helped me feel better, cause it forces me to be aware. How do my footsteps sound? How do they sound different from each other? I can hear the wind through the trees, I can feel the wind going through my finger tips, I can feel the air going through my lungs and body. It&amp;#39;s all about stopping, and bringing your attention to all your senses. What do you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell? Awareness is also useful from preventing anxiety attacks. It&amp;#39;s pretty much the same thing, but it&amp;#39;s called grounding; bringing your attention out of your thoughts and get back in touch with reality. We spend so much time getting lost and interacting with our thoughts that we lose touch of our reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and depression is a bitch because it creates illusions. Not believing you can do it, not feeling like you&amp;#39;re good enough, etc. That&amp;#39;s what they do, it causes you to interact and agree with every little negative thought. Break free of these thought patterns. Learn to let go of these thoughts that serve no practical use.
