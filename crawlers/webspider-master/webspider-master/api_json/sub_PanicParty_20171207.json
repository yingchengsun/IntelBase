This year has been like any other year of my life. I didn&amp;#39;t know this type of thing could even happen to someone until now, since I&amp;#39;m experiencing it. You guys know what I&amp;#39;m talking about. Panic disorder, social phobia, chronic anxiety, just a mix of all of those. From the second I wake up every morning, my vision is already blurry. My windpipe and chest are being squeezed to the point that every breath is a struggle, my pounding heart shakes my body and keeps me up at night, my head throbs with dizziness, my knees are weak and shaking, etc. I&amp;#39;ve been skipping classes, avoiding social interactions and sabotaging relationships, and it&amp;#39;s not because I want to, but it&amp;#39;s because I literally ALWAYS feel like I&amp;#39;m dying. Literally the only thing that makes me feel like a normal person is 2mg of \nxanax, and that doesn&amp;#39;t even do the trick sometimes. And, up until now, I didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone because I am embarrassed and ashamed of my condition. Because if you don&amp;#39;t have this condition, you couldn&amp;#39;t possibly understand what it&amp;#39;s like. Up until a few weeks ago, I didn&amp;#39;t even try to get help for my condition because I was afraid that I&amp;#39;d either faint, cry, or both in front of the doctor or psychiatrist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally saw my school psychiatrist and she refused to prescribe me Xanax because &amp;quot;I couldn&amp;#39;t tell her what was making me anxious.&amp;quot; (Literally waking up in the morning does!) I met with teachers and my school dean because I&amp;#39;ve been skipping classes and presentations and my grades are on the steep decline, and while they&amp;#39;re sympathetic, they all just tell me that I should see a doctor because I might have a heart condition and that it&amp;#39;s not fair that I don&amp;#39;t do my work while all the other students are able to. As if I&amp;#39;m not already humiliated enough by my condition. So really I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do.

This year has been like any other year of my life. I didn't know this type of thing could even happen to someone until now, since I'm experiencing it. You guys know what I'm talking about. Panic disorder, social phobia, chronic anxiety, just a mix of all of those. From the second I wake up every morning, my vision is already blurry. My windpipe and chest are being squeezed to the point that every breath is a struggle, my pounding heart shakes my body and keeps me up at night, my head throbs with dizziness, my knees are weak and shaking, etc. I've been skipping classes, avoiding social interactions and sabotaging relationships, and it's not because I want to, but it's because I literally ALWAYS feel like I'm dying. Literally the only thing that makes me feel like a normal person is 2mg of \nxanax, and that doesn't even do the trick sometimes. And, up until now, I didn't tell anyone because I am embarrassed and ashamed of my condition. Because if you don't have this condition, you couldn't possibly understand what it's like. Up until a few weeks ago, I didn't even try to get help for my condition because I was afraid that I'd either faint, cry, or both in front of the doctor or psychiatrist. \n\nI finally saw my school psychiatrist and she refused to prescribe me Xanax because \"I couldn't tell her what was making me anxious.\" (Literally waking up in the morning does!) I met with teachers and my school dean because I've been skipping classes and presentations and my grades are on the steep decline, and while they're sympathetic, they all just tell me that I should see a doctor because I might have a heart condition and that it's not fair that I don't do my work while all the other students are able to. As if I'm not already humiliated enough by my condition. So really I just don't know what to do. My grades are shit and it's my junior year, I haven't told my parents about any of this because they don't believe in mental illness, and really just feel fucked for the life I used to want. \n\nWelp, that's my rant, and thank you to anyone who read the whole thing.

I have dealt with childhood trauma, but even before then, anxiety has persisted in my life for as long as I can remember.  I have always been a rigid perfectionist and anxiety would often lead me to beat up on myself when I didn&amp;#39;t perform as well as I had initially hoped.  Going into my teens, I became emotionally numb for a period of 2 years, and began a binge of self-destructive behaviors such as: cutting, eating disorders, drug use, and other illegal activities I&amp;#39;d rather not say.  Looking back, I recognize that I was in my first depersonalized state and these destructive behaviors were a way of me reaching out to feel something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I got better with the emotional flat-line and became somewhat of living, breathing, feeling human being again.  I was prescribed Prozac at that time (as opposed to Lexapro which made me into a suicidal mess) so that might have helped.  However, it was around this time that I started having extreme panic attacks with certain activities, most notably every time I would receive a grade from my instructor for my performance on the piano and also when I would come home from school.  Eventually, I cut off the Prozac entirely and I was able to complete my first semester in college with little to no panic attacks.  I still had recurring anxiety, but that was not an issue as I am a regular perfectionist and &amp;quot;worry wart&amp;quot; in my daily life--aka I used it to my advantage to secure a near-perfect GPA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, come second semester, and I am now extremely stressed.  I&amp;#39;ve started birth control, which has a side effect of depression and might be worth mentioning, but I know that my depression is largely influenced by the issue of my now-rampant anxiety.  Last semester, I was able to channel my anxiety into a &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; manner (which is still not technically healthy), or basically I was a huge overachiever when it came to my grades and involvement.  Since I have returned to school, I feel the same need to overachieve, but feel mentally exhausted and unmotivated to even do so.  I&amp;#39;m also extremely fatigued, with sweaty, tingling fingers/hands multiple times a day and an absolute loss of concentration.  I find that caffeine makes these symptoms worse but I can&amp;#39;t help but drink it because I am so tired all the time.  I also should mention that I sleep for a sufficient (if not excessive) amount of time, but now wake up randomly at around 4 am/5 am everyday.  And not only that, but the panic attacks have resurfaced as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I should add, is that the panic attacks have now been accompanied by an immediate onset of depersonalization after they occur.  I will be panicking, crying, and then the next moment, my emotions just shut off, my vision blurs though I am still consciously doing whatever it was that I was doing before, and I find myself completely lose control of my own body.  Meanwhile my thoughts are ongoing, and I am contemplating my existence and how numb I am, but I am entirely unable to talk and &amp;#39;snap out of it&amp;#39;.  Unfortunately, as a former cutter, I have relapsed in the past week because I know it&amp;#39;s a method that works.  I&amp;#39;m not trying to justify it, but in the moment, it really felt like the only thing that could snap me out of the numbness so I did it after not having cut for a month (probably the adrenaline and dopamine).  I should mention other times I cut, I&amp;#39;m usually extremely stressed and angered and just want to take it out on myself, however this issue of hurting myself with the numbness scares me even more because the depersonalization has a tendency to alienate myself from my own body and I am scared that I could potentially hurt myself more than I was intending to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So right now, I have an appointment booked for March 6th with a therapist but will not be seeing a psychiatrist until after that appointment (probably late March).  I was alrightwhen I booked it, but now I&amp;#39;m realizing how awful my life truly has been this past month and how far I have managed to spiral downwards due to my anxiety.  I really don&amp;#39;t know how I will be able to wait until March 6th; everyday is so turbulent with so many ups and downs, or better yet, so many bouts of panic and numbness.  I would like to be on medication but not as SSRI as I think my depression is more dopamine related due to my thrill-seeking behaviors and depersonalization episodes.  There&amp;#39;s also a part of me that is absolutely terrified of even going to the therapist--I have never been 100% honest with a therapist or psychiatrist as my history of behaviors and illness usually writes me off as &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; or just as some addict trying to get hooked on drugs.  I just don&amp;#39;t really know what to do at this point, I&amp;#39;m across the country going to college, completely alone, unmotivated, and absolutely consumed by anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post.  I feel so helpless and feel ashamed to tell anyone of what I&amp;#39;m truly going through at the moment.  My parents would be extremely worried if they knew of the severity of my mental health and especially that I had relapsed recently.  I feel somewhat apprehensive about even going to the therapist and psychiatrist because of the anxiety of telling them all of the stupid mental shit I have brought upon myself, but I know it&amp;#39;s the only way I&amp;#39;m going to get any better, even if I have to wait until March.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, I&amp;#39;m just barely hanging on by a thread and need some reassurance that I&amp;#39;m not so alone after all.

The other day I had to leave work in the middle of my shift to go to urgent care because I was convinced that I was having a heart attack. \n\nLuckily though, I am not alone! And I'm so glad that there's a little corner on the internet of people who feel like me and people who FELT like me but got better. I hope I can find support here and return the favor!

(By the way, I&amp;#39;m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should explain. I know I have a panic disorder, I&amp;#39;ve struggled with depression and self-harming, and my panic attacks generally consist of hiding in a corner, shaking, crying and either biting myself or scratching my arms/digging my nails into my arms. \nAlso, I&amp;#39;m sorry if this is written badly: describing my feelings doesn&amp;#39;t come easily to me but it&amp;#39;s less difficult when it&amp;#39;s words on a screen. I can almost pretend it&amp;#39;s a story. Stories help me escape from the usual thoughts of low self-esteem (you know the ones, &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re fat, you&amp;#39;re ugly, you&amp;#39;re broken&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it first dawned on me that I had some sort of panic disorder at my first job. It was a mess. I&amp;#39;ll spare the details to preserve the Data Protection act. Suffice it to say, when someone who has been working in her first job for 10 months, fresh out of getting a Level 3 diploma in Childcare, and has been struggling with panic attacks (and this was known to the manglement, by the way), DON&amp;#39;T put them in charge of the baby room for a day, consisting of ten infants ranging from 0-2 years, some of whom had medical requirements. And with only an apprentice, a new employee and an utterly useless &amp;#39;student&amp;#39; to help - breaking more than a few laws in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bit myself so hard in my last week there that I left bruises on my arms, both of them. I was hitting my head against the wall... brooms... scratching my arms... I walked out and didn&amp;#39;t go back. That same year, someone I loved like a grandfather had died, and I got pulled into the office a few weeks later and was told &amp;quot;you aren&amp;#39;t as cheerful as you normally are, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what&amp;#39;s going on, you leave your feelings at the door&amp;quot; by the day manager.\nThe same day-manager suggested that I seek professional help when she saw the bruises on my arms the Friday I walked out and never went back. \n&lt;em&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a great year for me, I&amp;#39;ll admit.&lt;/em&gt;\nIt wasn&amp;#39;t easy to have the courage to get help, least of all because of lack of support from my Mother. &amp;quot;If you might have these issues, what does this mean for me?!&amp;quot; (not to mention the screaming about how /she/ wanted to kill herself sometimes, after I&amp;#39;d admitted to her that I&amp;#39;d contemplated suicide but oh well) But I got CBT, and it helped. For a while. I have a new job, in a completely different field, and I like it there. It&amp;#39;s a good place.\nBut I&amp;#39;ve noticed something. Aside from the occasional panic attacks. I know about those, I can deal with them. But these ... I don&amp;#39;t know how to describe them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my own mind telling me this, no mistake, but they&amp;#39;re like orders. Urges. They take over my thoughts &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hit your head against that wall hit your head hit your head make it bleed hit your head hit your head&amp;quot; \nAnd it&amp;#39;s usually accompanied with this massive feeling of dread. \n&amp;quot;Scratch your arms scratch them scratch them scratch them dig your nails in dig dig dig make them bleed make them hurt make them bleed&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t make me feel better. I feel ashamed of myself. I know it&amp;#39;s not right, but what do I do? Every time it happens I have this overwhelming feeling that something is going to go wrong, that I have to do this... like it&amp;#39;s a punishment for something that really, I know I haven&amp;#39;t done wrong. I talk to a customer on the phone, I hang up and for a while I&amp;#39;m okay, then it hits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Digdigscratchyourarms scratchthemscratchthem! You&amp;#39;re bad, you&amp;#39;re broken look at you you&amp;#39;re disgusting&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it won&amp;#39;t leave me alone until I give in.\nIt was ten-fifteen minutes of me sat at my desk today, taptaptapping with all of the fingers on my hand while it felt like something was in my left forearm and the only way to get rid of that feeling was to dig in with my nails. That the only way to get these thoughts to stop was to give in. I won today. I didn&amp;#39;t give in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about next time? Is this just me? How do I deal with this? I don&amp;#39;t want to talk to my family. I once ... I don&amp;#39;t know whether it was because I&amp;#39;d had a bad day or what but I was in the kitchen doing my laundry and suddenly I knew about the knives. The sharp ones. The ones that could do the most damage. And I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I could stop myself. I started screaming bloody murder, making sure I wouldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere until someone came. My older brother came to see what the fuss was about. No-one else moved (Mother probably didn&amp;#39;t know. She&amp;#39;s hearing-impaired, and she has been all her life, so it hasn&amp;#39;t exactly been plain sailing for her, either) but he sat with me until I started to calm down, and then Mother walked by and made a face at me. You know, the one where someone imitates a crying face at you? My brother told her to go away, and the day after my irate father turned up wanting to know why my brother and I had told her to &amp;#39;f-off&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t raise this with my family. I haven&amp;#39;t told them what I&amp;#39;m really thinking because I&amp;#39;m sure Mother would just come up with something even worse that happened to her &amp;quot;SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE&amp;quot; she screamed one night, after the toilet blocked and my brothers and I were trying to unblock it (she wanted to use the toilet, and it was the only one in the house). So I can&amp;#39;t talk to her. She also insults my personal hygiene, which does wonders for my self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mother:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;have you eaten fish lately or has it just been that time of the month for you? All right, don&amp;#39;t get upset!&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love you too, Mother Dearest. I think a character from a computer game who murdered all of her children is more pleasant than you (aside note: has anyone noticed how fondly the Night Mother talks about Cicero? How sad she seems for him?) My brothers... I don&amp;#39;t want to bother them, and my father&amp;#39;s only just going back to work after being off on sick for five months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By Sithis, what a sorry mess I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I get &amp;#39;mental orders&amp;#39; from myself to hit my head on things/or to bite &amp;amp; scratch my arms that are nearly impossible to ignore. How do other Redditors cope with this?\n&lt;em&gt;Please let me know if the formatting doesn&amp;#39;t make sense: I&amp;#39;ll do my best to amend it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: I&amp;#39;ve booked an appointment at the doctor&amp;#39;s in a few weeks&amp;#39; time.

Of course there&amp;#39;ll be follow up appointments to this but I feel like it&amp;#39;s, maybe not progress exactly because I&amp;#39;ve not gone anywhere but I feel like something&amp;#39;s being done. I&amp;#39;m doing something about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So, I don't know if this is where I put in the obligatory first time poster thing, or what... but I've known about Reddit for a while, only recently started browsing it. (By the way, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in)\n\nMaybe I should explain. I know I have a panic disorder, I've struggled with depression and self-harming, and my panic attacks generally consist of hiding in a corner, shaking, crying and either biting myself or scratching my arms/digging my nails into my arms. \nAlso, I'm sorry if this is written badly: describing my feelings doesn't come easily to me but it's less difficult when it's words on a screen. I can almost pretend it's a story. Stories help me escape from the usual thoughts of low self-esteem (you know the ones, \"you're fat, you're ugly, you're broken\")\n\nAnyway, it first dawned on me that I had some sort of panic disorder at my first job. It was a mess. I'll spare the details to preserve the Data Protection act. Suffice it to say, when someone who has been working in her first job for 10 months, fresh out of getting a Level 3 diploma in Childcare, and has been struggling with panic attacks (and this was known to the manglement, by the way), DON'T put them in charge of the baby room for a day, consisting of ten infants ranging from 0-2 years, some of whom had medical requirements. And with only an apprentice, a new employee and an utterly useless 'student' to help - breaking more than a few laws in the process.\n\nI bit myself so hard in my last week there that I left bruises on my arms, both of them. I was hitting my head against the wall... brooms... scratching my arms... I walked out and didn't go back. That same year, someone I loved like a grandfather had died, and I got pulled into the office a few weeks later and was told \"you aren't as cheerful as you normally are, it doesn't matter what's going on, you leave your feelings at the door\" by the day manager.\nThe same day-manager suggested that I seek professional help when she saw the bruises on my arms the Friday I walked out and never went back. \n*It wasn't a great year for me, I'll admit.*\nIt wasn't easy to have the courage to get help, least of all because of lack of support from my Mother. \"If you might have these issues, what does this mean for me?!\" (not to mention the screaming about how /she/ wanted to kill herself sometimes, after I'd admitted to her that I'd contemplated suicide but oh well) But I got CBT, and it helped. For a while. I have a new job, in a completely different field, and I like it there. It's a good place.\nBut I've noticed something. Aside from the occasional panic attacks. I know about those, I can deal with them. But these ... I don't know how to describe them. \n\nIt's my own mind telling me this, no mistake, but they're like orders. Urges. They take over my thoughts \n\n&gt; \"Hit your head against that wall hit your head hit your head make it bleed hit your head hit your head\" \nAnd it's usually accompanied with this massive feeling of dread. \n&gt; \"Scratch your arms scratch them scratch them scratch them dig your nails in dig dig dig make them bleed make them hurt make them bleed\". \n\nIt doesn't make me feel better. I feel ashamed of myself. I know it's not right, but what do I do? Every time it happens I have this overwhelming feeling that something is going to go wrong, that I have to do this... like it's a punishment for something that really, I know I haven't done wrong. I talk to a customer on the phone, I hang up and for a while I'm okay, then it hits. \n&gt; \"Digdigscratchyourarms scratchthemscratchthem! You're bad, you're broken look at you you're disgusting\" \n\nAnd it won't leave me alone until I give in.\nIt was ten-fifteen minutes of me sat at my desk today, taptaptapping with all of the fingers on my hand while it felt like something was in my left forearm and the only way to get rid of that feeling was to dig in with my nails. That the only way to get these thoughts to stop was to give in. I won today. I didn't give in. \n\nBut what about next time? Is this just me? How do I deal with this? I don't want to talk to my family. I once ... I don't know whether it was because I'd had a bad day or what but I was in the kitchen doing my laundry and suddenly I knew about the knives. The sharp ones. The ones that could do the most damage. And I wasn't sure I could stop myself. I started screaming bloody murder, making sure I wouldn't go anywhere until someone came. My older brother came to see what the fuss was about. No-one else moved (Mother probably didn't know. She's hearing-impaired, and she has been all her life, so it hasn't exactly been plain sailing for her, either) but he sat with me until I started to calm down, and then Mother walked by and made a face at me. You know, the one where someone imitates a crying face at you? My brother told her to go away, and the day after my irate father turned up wanting to know why my brother and I had told her to 'f-off'. \n\nAnyway, that's why I don't raise this with my family. I haven't told them what I'm really thinking because I'm sure Mother would just come up with something even worse that happened to her \"SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE\" she screamed one night, after the toilet blocked and my brothers and I were trying to unblock it (she wanted to use the toilet, and it was the only one in the house). So I can't talk to her. She also insults my personal hygiene, which does wonders for my self esteem.\n&gt; **Mother:** \"have you eaten fish lately or has it just been that time of the month for you? All right, don't get upset!\". \n\nI love you too, Mother Dearest. I think a character from a computer game who murdered all of her children is more pleasant than you (aside note: has anyone noticed how fondly the Night Mother talks about Cicero? How sad she seems for him?) My brothers... I don't want to bother them, and my father's only just going back to work after being off on sick for five months. \n\nBy Sithis, what a sorry mess I am.\n\nTL;DR: I get 'mental orders' from myself to hit my head on things/or to bite &amp; scratch my arms that are nearly impossible to ignore. How do other Redditors cope with this?\n*Please let me know if the formatting doesn't make sense: I'll do my best to amend it*\n\n\nUpdate: I've booked an appointment at the doctor's in a few weeks' time. I'll take an adapted version of this post with me and see how it goes.\n\nUpdate 2: Went to the doctor today.

Rapid pulse, sweats, sometimes a need to be stagnant and comfortable in my car/room. Some of you may know all too well.\nFor those of you that don&amp;#39;t, it can be scary. Only once or twice did it ever feel so severe that it reached beyond my logical brain to freak me out, but generally speaking, I know what I&amp;#39;m dealing with here. That being said, I reached such a point a year and a half to two years ago now, and it was stressful then. I quit for what was at most, a week, and resumed use. Feeling better, over the period between then and now, I eventually began using on that level again.\nFast forward to a month ago at this point. I started to have a few days in particular that really freaked me out, one day after I renounced weed for the foreseeable upcoming month, I had a fake-out heart attack, which luckily my family was present for and didn&amp;#39;t effect me beyond some pretttty bad panic.\nNow, it&amp;#39;s been over three weeks, and on Halloween, in addition to a few beers, I had tried smoking again. It wasn&amp;#39;t much, the half ashy remnants of a stranger&amp;#39;s plastic sherlock pipe at a party for 2$. Still, I felt fine. I should stress that I didn&amp;#39;t try too much here anyway. However, the next day, I decided to try just a bowl of one of my smaller bongs, test things out. Well, though it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as the other day I&amp;#39;d described, it pretty much skyrocketed to some pretty intense pulse action and lightheadedness. Since yesterday I&amp;#39;ve been pretty good, especially knowing now for certain weed is the triggering cause.\nSo now, I have a few questions to pose to you, the lovely stoners of Reddit. The first question(s) are those in the title: what should I do, in general. And what are some of your experiences with this kind of situation. Moving on though, I have a few other, smaller questions: perhaps it&amp;#39;s just the bag I&amp;#39;ve had which has been the same stuff for a while, which wasn&amp;#39;t hitting me like that when I&amp;#39;d first gotten it, so... Perhaps I need to give things more time? All questions towards alleviating this issue.\nThen of course, and lastly, there&amp;#39;s the issue of what this means for me, for my use habit. If it&amp;#39;s necessary to discontinue, I value my young college brain and future more than this weed lifestyle I&amp;#39;ve had the last 4-odd years; but there are challenges that come with such a sudden potential halt in my weed smoking. First of all, many of the few friends I have left in this particularly puzzling time of my life are stoners, and my personality itself along with a lot of my thinking patterns are kind of...&amp;#39;absorbed remnants&amp;#39; of the general effects pot&amp;#39;s had on me as a person. So for me to forsake smoking is fine, but it also means I&amp;#39;m removing a sort of piece of my mentality, to a degree.

I was traveling for 3 months, having the time of my life.  And the last six weeks were spend traveling with the Bf. But when he left, i got a major panic attack for the first time in my life. Since I then didn&amp;#39;t realise it was a panick attack i tried getting on with my day: got coffee, went shopping, got food, ... But i kept feeling terrible (nauseated, strange dissociated feeling like i was dreaming etc.) This lasted for several hours, till i booked a ticket back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got home, missed the travel and soon had a ticket back a month later (since i still had my actual return ticket). Since then everything was fine, i was my normal spontaneous active self. Normally I&amp;#39;m quite confident and independent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until this weekend, I was on a free festival and had a good day. Despite it being HOT and the organisation not providing water. But suddenly in the middle of the night I got the exact same feeling: chest started getting tight and heavy, feeling disconnected with reality, at a total unease and in panick (&amp;#39;i need to get out of here&amp;#39;). As predicted, also this time I got home in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this second situation i&amp;#39;ve been thinking of it as panick attacks, and seriously doubting my travel plans. I would leave in ten days, by myself, for two months. And everytime I just think of it I get a new (lighter version of a) panick attack. Which makes me sure I actually don&amp;#39;t want to go anymore. Which sucks since I don&amp;#39;t have cancellation insurance and would loose quite some money.. But every time i start panicking the only thing that calms me is thinking &amp;#39;i don&amp;#39;t have to go&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i am in total dilemma. I never had this problem before, i loved my previous travels, but now suddenly i just feel like i can&amp;#39;t and will have the same &amp;#39;go home-reflex&amp;#39; and will lose more money because i would buy a new ticket back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this kinda sucks..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi Panicparty,\n\nI recently started to have what seems like panic attacks.

I was traveling for 3 months, having the time of my life.  And the last six weeks were spend traveling with the Bf. But when he left, i got a major panic attack for the first time in my life. Since I then didn't realise it was a panick attack i tried getting on with my day: got coffee, went shopping, got food, ... But i kept feeling terrible (nauseated, strange dissociated feeling like i was dreaming etc.) This lasted for several hours, till i booked a ticket back home.\n\nI got home, missed the travel and soon had a ticket back a month later (since i still had my actual return ticket). Since then everything was fine, i was my normal spontaneous active self. Normally I'm quite confident and independent.\n\nUntil this weekend, I was on a free festival and had a good day. Despite it being HOT and the organisation not providing water. But suddenly in the middle of the night I got the exact same feeling: chest started getting tight and heavy, feeling disconnected with reality, at a total unease and in panick ('i need to get out of here'). As predicted, also this time I got home in a matter of hours.\n\nSince this second situation i've been thinking of it as panick attacks, and seriously doubting my travel plans. I would leave in ten days, by myself, for two months. And everytime I just think of it I get a new (lighter version of a) panick attack. Which makes me sure I actually don't want to go anymore. Which sucks since I don't have cancellation insurance and would loose quite some money.. But every time i start panicking the only thing that calms me is thinking 'i don't have to go'.\n\nSo i am in total dilemma. I never had this problem before, i loved my previous travels, but now suddenly i just feel like i can't and will have the same 'go home-reflex' and will lose more money because i would buy a new ticket back.\n\nSo this kinda sucks..", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "2b78f9", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "When having a situational panic attack, avoid that situation?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4u5", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_2b78f9", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/PanicParty/comments/2b78f9/when_having_a_situational_panic_attack_avoid_that/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1405878692.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicParty/comments/2b78f9/when_having_a_situational_panic_attack_avoid_that/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Paniccat", "created_utc": 1405849892.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PanicParty", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.PanicParty", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PanicParty", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t happen often to me, but it has happened a few times in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time a friend called me late at night (I was sleeping) because he was having a problem with his girlfriend and needed to move out.

We would like to help people understand a variety of mental illnesses, from depression to anxiety, ADHD to PTSD, depersonalization to phobias, addiction to bipolar, and everything in between.\nThe intention is to gather anonymous stories from all over and then perform them as monologues, spoken word poetry, and short sketches, in order for viewers to connect with sufferers of mental illness on an emotional level. We'd like viewers to see that anyone can be a sufferer, and that mental illness does not need to be taboo.\nMind Memoirs is starting as a university level project in the US, but we are looking to showcase all kinds of stories about all kinds of mental health experiences from all over the world. We hope that the project will eventually expand, but for now we are collecting stories for an initial performance later this quarter.\nWe are collecting stories until May 10th, and they can be submitted to mindmemoirs@yahoo.com. Stories will always be handled respectfully and anonymously.\nIf you would like to participate, or simply to spread the word, we would be extremely grateful.\nThanks for reading!\u200b", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "23st3l", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "share a short memoir about mental illness", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4u5", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_23st3l", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/PanicParty/comments/23st3l/share_a_short_memoir_about_mental_illness/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1398315269.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicParty/comments/23st3l/share_a_short_memoir_about_mental_illness/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "mindmemoir", "created_utc": 1398286469.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PanicParty", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.PanicParty", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PanicParty", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I had a bout of 2 hours of a panic attack - which I forced myself to work through - due to deadlines and pressure. that was over 48 hours ago.\nHas anyone experienced this?

I&amp;#39;m a male in his late 20&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had an issue with vomiting since I was 10 years old.  I remember feeling ill one day during class and asking to go to the nurse&amp;#39;s office, when I had arrived the door was locked.  I remember going into the fetal position and crying at this point.  When the nurse finally arrived I was sent home.  The following day of school I had the same nauseous feeling.  This time the nurse had me lay down and then go back to class.  After a few days of the same symptoms I was not allowed to go to the nurses office anymore.  That is when I stopped eating to not feel ill at school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This issue was only at school at first, but by high school it had began to creep into every aspect of my life (social, family, personal etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I started working at 16, I would not eat until I got home from school / work and that would be around 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also around the time when I first started approaching my parents about my problem.  Through my parents insurance they paired me with a psychiatrist and started me on anti-depressants.  Due to my fear of vomiting being so large I could only take medicine at night.  I went through maybe 10 or so medicines before they told me that this is something that I just have to live with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 19 I was able to get a job with decent health care.  Kaiser Permanente initially started me with strictly meds, but after a few sessions of practically begging for help they set me up with a CBT therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sessions generally would last an hour and would be once a week.  I would mention the trouble I had eating and how it was destroying my life.  They told me that I have an anxiety disorder and that eating was not the issue.  I felt like I was going insane when I had 3 different therapists tell me this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 years later at 26, I still have the same job and I&amp;#39;m still not eating at work.  My weight never went above 115 during this whole period and I am around 5&amp;#39;7.  I looked like I was 12-13 years old.  I don&amp;#39;t even want to get started about the ridicule you experience being a rail thin male with no meat on their bones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this time I also managed to get to my senior year at a university, but I would do what I did in high school, not eat until I got home from everything, 9pm or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night of having what felt like non-stop panic for 3 days I checked myself into an ER.  I told them that I had not eaten in 2 days and that I can&amp;#39;t with my phobia and that I was so afraid.  The nurse left and next thing I knew I was being strapped down to a gurney and they stuck me on a 51/50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was probably one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life.  They initially stuck me in a room with a guy who was punching the wall all night.  I begged the nurse that they made a mistake and they told me to wait until morning.  I never felt so afraid for my life.  In the morning they finally told me they made a mistake and stuck me in a more secured environment.  Before the 72 hours they ended up releasing me saying that I had no place there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this experience something strange happened within my body.  I don&amp;#39;t know if it was from all the shock, but when I went back to work 2 days later, I saw a bagel on the counter and picked it up and ate it.  I felt nothing.  No anxiety, nothing.  All of the sudden I was eating breakfast, lunch, dinner.  I was being social.  I started socially drinking too (never did due to my fear).  It felt like something just clicked and I was fixed.  I was not taking any meds, it was the strangest thing.  My weight went to 160lbs and it felt incredible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know that there is no &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;, but for 1 year I felt normal.  It was great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011 I was laid off of my job with a bunch of people and this is when everything started going down hill.  I really can&amp;#39;t even recall a specific point of when things started to turn in relation to the eating, but being laid off definitely kicked my anxiety back into full gear.  I ended up just sitting at home not eating, laying in bed for hours.  My weight went back down to 120lbs and I ended up moving back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was terrible since even eating around my parents is difficult with this phobia.  My father would get angry when I wouldn&amp;#39;t eat around them and it just magnified the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few months i finally landed another job and moved back out with a friend.\nAfter a year of not eating at work I decided to seek help again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a place that does ACT therapy and exposures with eating food.  I initially started going going after work, but it was deemed unsafe since I was not able to eat at this place.  I was not getting enough food so they pulled me off of work with FMLA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been 6 months since that and I have since gone back to work part time.  I still struggle with my panic attacks and my exposures are absolute nightmares.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on one anti-depressant currently that actually worked great the first 2 months but now it feels like I&amp;#39;m not taking anything.  I&amp;#39;ve had panic attacks for the last 3 days that have felt non-stop.  I was recommended last week by my therapist to write during my panic episodes.  I ended up writing 22 pages of the darkest thoughts I&amp;#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is long winded and I&amp;#39;m sorry for all grammar errors, but I really don&amp;#39;t know where else to turn to.  I&amp;#39;m ashamed to talk to family and friends because they have always been there for me and have backed me 100% getting help, but when I have constant panic attacks all the time I feel like I am failing them.  It&amp;#39;s tough to tell them how I am really doing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for anyone who took the time to read this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short as there is so much to type about what I'm going through.

She will bike across the entire nation for a single purpose: to raise awareness of the impact of stigma associated with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our documentary crew will accompany Clara&amp;#39;s ride across Canada, chronicling the drama and the challenges of this gruelling athletic feat and courageous undertaking.

I found neither the time nor energy to read and write everything I should. The fatigue got worse and I found myself asleep on every trip home and even during some lectures. To make things worse, every morning when I took the train to university, nausea would come and take hold of me, even though I carefully watched my diet.

My GP prescribed SSRI&amp;#39;s at first (Zoloft, Lexapro, and Presiq).  I really hated taking them (awful side effects including increased anxiety, sexual problems, &amp;quot;brain zaps,&amp;quot; etc).  After about a year of taking these drugs my GP referred me to a psychiatrist.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing my new Pdoc wanted me to be on was Prozac.  He explained that Prozac is the best at treating GAD due to its long half-life.  I told him about the awful side effects from the other SSRI&amp;#39;s.  So instead of Prozac, he put me on Buspar.  It worked for awhile and was for the most part side effect free.  But over time I had to constantly increase the dose (was taking up to 90mg a day) with little benefit.  My Pdoc again wanted to put me on Prozac which I again told him about my past experiences with SSRI&amp;#39;s.  So he put me on Klonopin (1mg a day) and all was well for well over 5 months with no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today was my 3 month &amp;quot;check up&amp;quot; and I was telling him that my anxiety has been getting increasingly worse.  He once again asked about my SSRI past.  Which I told him AGAIN.  Instead of increasing the dose of Klonopin, which I figured he would do, he insisted we tried Prozac.

My GP prescribed SSRI's at first (Zoloft, Lexapro, and Presiq).  I really hated taking them (awful side effects including increased anxiety, sexual problems, \"brain zaps,\" etc).  After about a year of taking these drugs my GP referred me to a psychiatrist.  \n\nThe first thing my new Pdoc wanted me to be on was Prozac.  He explained that Prozac is the best at treating GAD due to its long half-life.  I told him about the awful side effects from the other SSRI's.  So instead of Prozac, he put me on Buspar.  It worked for awhile and was for the most part side effect free.  But over time I had to constantly increase the dose (was taking up to 90mg a day) with little benefit.  My Pdoc again wanted to put me on Prozac which I again told him about my past experiences with SSRI's.  So he put me on Klonopin (1mg a day) and all was well for well over 5 months with no side effects.\n\nToday was my 3 month \"check up\" and I was telling him that my anxiety has been getting increasingly worse.  He once again asked about my SSRI past.  Which I told him AGAIN.  Instead of increasing the dose of Klonopin, which I figured he would do, he insisted we tried Prozac.  I made it clear to him about my feelings on SSRI's but he said not to worry, it will work.  He prescribed me 20mg to start and said that he will probably increase the dose to 40mg after a couple of weeks.\n\nAnyways (sorry for the long rant) I am now taking Prozac and was wondering if any of you are taking it and how it makes you feel?

A couple months ago I started Zoloft which actually made the anxiety extremely worse, but I couldn&amp;#39;t tell at first because it also did manage to make me very happy. I suffered a moment of derealization and haven&amp;#39;t felt the same since. I quickly weaned off and haven&amp;#39;t been on for a few weeks. Buspar seems to do nothing, only my klonopin significantly helps which I take almost daily.  I basically realized I&amp;#39;ve developed full blown panic disorder (fear of panic attacks and anxiety). I&amp;#39;m going for my Master&amp;#39;s and work too, but I feel like I&amp;#39;m losing a grip on it all and dread days more and more. I&amp;#39;m seeing a psych tomorrow to start CBT and am seeing my med doc on Tuesday and will probably try cymbalta again which I used before and it seemed to slightly help.

Especially now that I don&amp;#39;t have a job anymore, the computer has become my main hideaway, and distraction.  I believe too much of it is causing my dizziness, and worsening my anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second Step: Exercise.\n-This one is simple, but will be difficult to get into a routine with.  I enjoy biking, especially trails.  I plan on doing some form of cardio exercise, for at least one hour, per day.  This all stems from the fact that I feel my happiest, when I&amp;#39;ve worn myself out.  During the summer I went on a family vacation one the beach, for a week strait.  During that time, I was in the water 8 hours a day, and never that incredible in years.  My appetite was amazing, and my mood was fantastic.  I hope to attain that again through exercise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3:  Eating and Sleeping better\n-Currently I wake up around 1030 or 11, and eat a small, unhealthy breakfast.  Followed by an upset stomach, and around 1 or 2 i&amp;#39;ll eat a decent lunch, etc.  I end up snacking a lot at night, and fall asleep around 2 or 3.  I would like to start eating more balanced meals, and eating larger during the earlier hours of the day.  I&amp;#39;ll have to start going to sleep and getting up earlier, which I believe the exercise will help me with (wearing me out).  Snacking late at night doesn&amp;#39;t help my stomach aches in the morning either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s my plan.  The only hard part is sticking to it for the next month.

I get great grades, don&amp;#39;t do drugs, hang out with great people, and overall have not run into any trouble. I am usually a positive and outgoing person, but those few months off from school changed me. I lived at home with my parents from September to January, which is when my chronic dizziness started. My home is unstable, and my parents are both bipolar and controlling. My parents&amp;#39; marriage is far from happy, and the only time they do not fight is when they join forces to abuse me. They are very sure that I am wrapped up in the drug scene and that I party my life away at school. Some nights, they stayed up and watched me because they thought I was strung out on drugs (once again, no drugs here). They threatened to put me in community college to WATCH me. If I ever came home a few minutes later than my curfew, they screamed for hours and said I was such a disappointment and an overall bad kid. On multiple occasions, my dad has shouted demeaning things at me for no reason and hit me (It&amp;#39;s not ok to hit your kids anymore when they are in their 20s). They are very paranoid people.  When I get upset over what they say, they act like they never said anything. They deny all of the abuse that they just threw at me.  They also have no idea why I get upset and deny all of their verbal abuse. Sometimes, things just go right back to normal after they have accused me of being a drug addict and a failure. Many more things have happened, but these are some examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents have made me uncomfortable in my own house, and even in my own skin in just a few months. I have never had any anxiety problems, but this abuse from my parents caused me to have a decent amount of anxiety. In November, I started to get dizzy every day to the point where I couldn&amp;#39;t drive anywhere. As I said before, I went to doctors and got many tests that concluded that I was perfectly healthy. Once I moved out to go to school for this Spring semester, my dizziness went away. The physical problem that was interfering with my life simply evaporated, which I was okay with. I was just happy that it was finally gone, and I was happy to be away from my household.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, now when I come home on the weekends (for local job obligations), the dizziness returns. My relationship with my parents is now civil, but my issues with them were never really resolved. They are still bipolar and abusive to each other, but not me.

No physical symptoms, but I felt something was very wrong, I was begging my friends to call 911, etc. Several years passed with no panic attacks or anxiety, then one day I experienced a full blown hardcore insane panic attack after staying up all night and drinking tons of caffeine. At the time I didn&amp;#39;t think it was a panic attack, and thankfully my friend was there to deter me from going to the ER. It lasted maybe 20-30 minutes, but it was awful.... my arms and legs were numb, I was shaking, pale, my head felt like it was on fire, and I honestly though I was going to die. After research, I decided that it was a panic attack, and since then it&amp;#39;s been a bit better now that I know there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with my body, just my mind. I had another panic attack since then that wasn&amp;#39;t as bad, it was really short, my muscles tensed up a bit, I felt really cold, but I handled it a bit better. But for the last week or so I can&amp;#39;t seem to shake the &amp;#39;anxious&amp;#39; feeling (I guess that&amp;#39;s what it is) that I feel sometimes. It&amp;#39;s this sinking feeling that makes me feel like something is very very wrong. I&amp;#39;ve started exercising more, eating better, and drinking almost no caffeine, and it seems a little better, but it&amp;#39;s still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I am particularly worried though, is because these episodes of extreme anxiety or panic seem to not have any trigger at all. I mean, sometimes I&amp;#39;ll get a heart palpitation and it&amp;#39;ll make me feel really anxious, but I&amp;#39;ll get over that quickly. Most of the time though, I&amp;#39;ll just get this wave of panic for absolutely no reason, and I get the beginnings of a panic attack, but I have learned to manage it so it doesn&amp;#39;t manifest any physical symptoms. This can happen at any time\u2014when I&amp;#39;m sitting alone and quiet, when I&amp;#39;m out with friends, when I&amp;#39;m at a show, when I&amp;#39;m in the bathroom, whatever. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be tied to anything that I can tell. From what I&amp;#39;ve read, that&amp;#39;s not typical of a panic disorder, but I could be wrong.

Family, and friends.  I was working a job at a grocery store for 3 1/2 years, which I ended up losing from my anxiety.  Been out of work for almost 2 months.  While I still live with my parents, I did have bills to pay, and money is now dwindling.  I need to find a new source of income, but I'm scared shitless.  I've been given offers, but I decline them and sit in my room all day, making excuses for why I don't do anything.  Why do I do this? I figure, if I don't do anything, I won't be able to disappoint anyone, when my anxiety gets in the way and prevents me from performing well.  This is the life I live, and I would do anything to change it.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "f1rtc", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I fear my life is going nowhere, so I sit here and do nothing.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4u5", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_f1rtc", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/PanicParty/comments/f1rtc/i_fear_my_life_is_going_nowhere_so_i_sit_here_and/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1294979509.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicParty/comments/f1rtc/i_fear_my_life_is_going_nowhere_so_i_sit_here_and/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "wantstoovercomethis", "created_utc": 1294950709.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PanicParty", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.PanicParty", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PanicParty", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an 18 year old college freshman, and I&amp;#39;ve suffered from anxiety for most of my life.

If you\u2019re really lucky, they\u2019ll regale you with tales of their own experiences with anxiety. After telling people that I have an anxiety disorder, I learned an interesting fact. Most people claim to have some sort of anxiety disorder. Now, I won\u2019t sit here on some high throne of anxiety and claim all others to be ignorant, but people who suffer from true anxiety can\u2019t help but feel disparaged by these comments. After all, if everyone has it, it isn\u2019t so bad, is it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who suffer from true anxiety, the kind that freezes life and makes tasks like driving to the supermarket an ordeal, aren\u2019t as common as those who find themselves shaky before an exam or nervous about having to give a presentation. The problem is that the word anxiety is too broad. Everyone, at some period of time, will feel anxious about something. To have an actual disorder is a completely different experience. The kind of anxiety I have, the kind that makes waking up in the morning a gamble, is something I would never wish upon anyone else. It drains my energy from and forces me to always be on alert in case my heart palpitates or my palms glisten with sweat. It steals my time and shows up at my front door unannounced and uninvited. This kind of anxiety is, in one word, devastating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simple anxiety over a test or a project is normal for any person. If you don\u2019t feel anxious at these times, you have a gift. That kind of anxiety is isolated and alone. It comes in small waves and leaves with all of its baggage. My anxiety is a squatter. It comes into my life and sets up on the couch for an undetermined period of time. Occasionally it\u2019s alone, but sometimes it brings friends. If it was just on my couch being a bum I could probably convince it to leave somehow. But when my living room is filled with its friends and they\u2019re having a party I\u2019m helpless. I sit in the corner and watch the madness unfold hoping that it all just ends quickly. When the party\u2019s over I clean up their mess as best I can and wait for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering who these friends are. I\u2019m never fully acquainted with my anxiety. It has a familiar face and usually the mayhem is similar, but every once in awhile someone new will come to my door. Someone unpredictable that gets too drunk and ends up making more of a mess than I would ever want. My anxiety, the one that keeps me locked in my house fearing for my life, has an unfortunate best friend\u2014panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often think that casual anxiety is separated from chronic anxiety by panic attacks. Again, people tell me plenty of stories about how they have had panic attacks in the past and I nod my head listening to the same type of narrative. After awhile it becomes borderline offensive. I want to get up in some epic display, point my finger at them and say, \u201cSo, you know what it\u2019s like to lay on the bathroom floor hugging a trashcan and weeping? You know what it feels like to hear your heart thumping in your eyes and wondering if you\u2019re going to die and whether or not it would be easier.\u201d But I\u2019ve never done that because I know that, like anxiety, a lot of people suffer from the occasional panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that, outside of the illogical madness in my mind, the worst part about suffering from chronic anxiety and panic attacks is that there is no way to show them. If I broke my arm, I could tell people how it happened and show them the cast. But with panic, I have no way to convey how devastating it is. I\u2019ve never taken my pill bottle out and asked my friends to write an encouraging note on it. When I\u2019m having a panic attack, I don\u2019t walk around telling people that I\u2019m losing my mind. I\u2019m incapable of rational thought. In fact, I hide the disorder because I\u2019m ashamed of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just this morning I was supposed to go on a small trip with a close friend. I woke up late feeling as though someone had folded my stomach into a small square that was being clenched by a fist. I sat up in bed halfway to hyperventilating and my hands were slick with sweat. I knew I couldn\u2019t bring myself to drive three hours from home to a place I didn\u2019t know\u2014a place where I couldn\u2019t tell you that the hospital is three blocks away and if I collapse I know that someone would find me. So when my friend showed up, I bowed out of the trip and saw the disappointment in their face. The same disappointment I\u2019ve seen in my mother\u2019s face and my father\u2019s face. The same look of bewilderment as to why I suffer from something like this. The truth of the matter is that no one really understands what this feels like. They try as hard as they can to empathize, but that empathy dries into a crusted confusion whenever a panic attack grips me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How could I ever explain to someone that half of mind is convinced that death is inevitable while the other half is trying to logic me into sanity? How could someone understand that I can\u2019t eat seafood anymore because the risk of illness is too high? These things seem completely insane. I know how crazy they sound, but at the same time I don\u2019t know. I feel foolish and childish when I walk into a house of strangers and make sure I have an exit strategy and a place to be sick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kills me the most about this disorder or disease or idiotic problem is that I\u2019ve forgotten what life is like outside of it. I can\u2019t remember what it feels like to wake up in the morning without stomach pains. I can\u2019t remember a time when I felt fine for an entire day. I don\u2019t remember the pleasure of eating food or having a beer. These things are lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every day is a new set of obstacles. I\u2019ve given up trying to explain how this affects me. What everyone wants is a sense of comfort and security. I have none and I try not to spread that around. People want happy endings to stories so I try and give that to them. Unfortunately, not every story has a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm sick of never being able to express what this is like so I wrote it down in a blind haze.

It drains my energy from and forces me to always be on alert in case my heart palpitates or my palms glisten with sweat. It steals my time and shows up at my front door unannounced and uninvited. This kind of anxiety is, in one word, devastating.\n\n\n\n\nSimple anxiety over a test or a project is normal for any person. If you don\u2019t feel anxious at these times, you have a gift. That kind of anxiety is isolated and alone. It comes in small waves and leaves with all of its baggage. My anxiety is a squatter. It comes into my life and sets up on the couch for an undetermined period of time. Occasionally it\u2019s alone, but sometimes it brings friends. If it was just on my couch being a bum I could probably convince it to leave somehow. But when my living room is filled with its friends and they\u2019re having a party I\u2019m helpless. I sit in the corner and watch the madness unfold hoping that it all just ends quickly. When the party\u2019s over I clean up their mess as best I can and wait for the next one.\n\n\n\n\nYou may be wondering who these friends are. I\u2019m never fully acquainted with my anxiety. It has a familiar face and usually the mayhem is similar, but every once in awhile someone new will come to my door. Someone unpredictable that gets too drunk and ends up making more of a mess than I would ever want. My anxiety, the one that keeps me locked in my house fearing for my life, has an unfortunate best friend\u2014panic attacks.\n\n\n\n\nI often think that casual anxiety is separated from chronic anxiety by panic attacks. Again, people tell me plenty of stories about how they have had panic attacks in the past and I nod my head listening to the same type of narrative. After awhile it becomes borderline offensive. I want to get up in some epic display, point my finger at them and say, \u201cSo, you know what it\u2019s like to lay on the bathroom floor hugging a trashcan and weeping? You know what it feels like to hear your heart thumping in your eyes and wondering if you\u2019re going to die and whether or not it would be easier.\u201d But I\u2019ve never done that because I know that, like anxiety, a lot of people suffer from the occasional panic attack.\n\n\n\n\nI firmly believe that, outside of the illogical madness in my mind, the worst part about suffering from chronic anxiety and panic attacks is that there is no way to show them. If I broke my arm, I could tell people how it happened and show them the cast. But with panic, I have no way to convey how devastating it is. I\u2019ve never taken my pill bottle out and asked my friends to write an encouraging note on it. When I\u2019m having a panic attack, I don\u2019t walk around telling people that I\u2019m losing my mind. I\u2019m incapable of rational thought. In fact, I hide the disorder because I\u2019m ashamed of it. \n\t\n\n\n\nJust this morning I was supposed to go on a small trip with a close friend. I woke up late feeling as though someone had folded my stomach into a small square that was being clenched by a fist. I sat up in bed halfway to hyperventilating and my hands were slick with sweat. I knew I couldn\u2019t bring myself to drive three hours from home to a place I didn\u2019t know\u2014a place where I couldn\u2019t tell you that the hospital is three blocks away and if I collapse I know that someone would find me. So when my friend showed up, I bowed out of the trip and saw the disappointment in their face. The same disappointment I\u2019ve seen in my mother\u2019s face and my father\u2019s face. The same look of bewilderment as to why I suffer from something like this. The truth of the matter is that no one really understands what this feels like. They try as hard as they can to empathize, but that empathy dries into a crusted confusion whenever a panic attack grips me.\n\t\n\n\n\nHow could I ever explain to someone that half of mind is convinced that death is inevitable while the other half is trying to logic me into sanity? How could someone understand that I can\u2019t eat seafood anymore because the risk of illness is too high? These things seem completely insane. I know how crazy they sound, but at the same time I don\u2019t know. I feel foolish and childish when I walk into a house of strangers and make sure I have an exit strategy and a place to be sick.\n\t\n\n\n\nWhat kills me the most about this disorder or disease or idiotic problem is that I\u2019ve forgotten what life is like outside of it. I can\u2019t remember what it feels like to wake up in the morning without stomach pains. I can\u2019t remember a time when I felt fine for an entire day. I don\u2019t remember the pleasure of eating food or having a beer. These things are lost.\n\t\n\n\n\nEvery day is a new set of obstacles. I\u2019ve given up trying to explain how this affects me. What everyone wants is a sense of comfort and security. I have none and I try not to spread that around. People want happy endings to stories so I try and give that to them. Unfortunately, not every story has a happy ending.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "exisc", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Long thing I wrote about anxiety/panic attacks.

I could be in bed with my laptop surfing the internet, hanging out with friends, or even picking up some things at the nearest supermarket, and then BLAM my heart is suddenly twitching and thrashing like crazy, and within the first second, my skin goes cold, my eyes go wide, I stop what I was doing, and put my hand to my chest.

I also understand that my negative feelings toward the situation are only prolonging my fear and adding to my stress, causing me to sometimes physically &amp;quot;give up&amp;quot; and panic uncontrollably.  There have been times that I&amp;#39;ve woken up early, driven all the way to school, prepared, parked and have become so overcome with anxiety that I actually couldn&amp;#39;t even get out of the car.  I&amp;#39;ve never told anyone this because I feel it&amp;#39;s hard for people to understand, but that&amp;#39;s what I mean by debilitating.  It&amp;#39;s the feeling of overwhelming stress and anxiety to the point where my body just doesn&amp;#39;t move.  I can&amp;#39;t open the car door or leave.  I just sit there until the feeling passes.  Sometimes I&amp;#39;d walk in very late after sitting in the parking lot for so long, or just drive away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it because school has become such a negative symbol in my life that I&amp;#39;m actually sub-conciously afraid of it?  If so, how do I overcome this?  Has this happened to anyone else?  It&amp;#39;s so hard to understand because it&amp;#39;s not laziness or lack of will.  It&amp;#39;s bizarre to me, and although it doesn&amp;#39;t happen often, when it does, I become so angry with myself, further propelling the anxiety cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for the record, I used to be a straight A student and have an absolute love for school, up until things started going awry in my family life, and school became a source of anxiety.

There have been times that I've woken up early, driven all the way to school, prepared, parked and have become so overcome with anxiety that I actually couldn't even get out of the car.  I've never told anyone this because I feel it's hard for people to understand, but that's what I mean by debilitating.  It's the feeling of overwhelming stress and anxiety to the point where my body just doesn't move.  I can't open the car door or leave.  I just sit there until the feeling passes.  Sometimes I'd walk in very late after sitting in the parking lot for so long, or just drive away.  \n\nIs it because school has become such a negative symbol in my life that I'm actually sub-conciously afraid of it?  If so, how do I overcome this?  Has this happened to anyone else?  It's so hard to understand because it's not laziness or lack of will.  It's bizarre to me, and although it doesn't happen often, when it does, I become so angry with myself, further propelling the anxiety cycle.\n\nAnd for the record, I used to be a straight A student and have an absolute love for school, up until things started going awry in my family life, and school became a source of anxiety.  It's almost like, if I can't do it perfectly, I can't do it at all.  If anyone has any input or tips on how to control this fear, anxiety and panic, please let me know.\n\n**TL;DR School causes debilitating fear and panic sometimes - help!**", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "e9k9f", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "IAE triggered into panic because of school?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4u5", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_e9k9f", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/PanicParty/comments/e9k9f/iae_triggered_into_panic_because_of_school/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1290395416.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicParty/comments/e9k9f/iae_triggered_into_panic_because_of_school/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1290366616.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PanicParty", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.PanicParty", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PanicParty", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been a community for about a month now and have been slowly but surely increasing our subscriber-ship.

Waking up sick to my stomach and feeling like I would rather die than go to work.\n\nThis past Monday was so bad that my wife made me stay home...got an appointment with a Neuropsychologist who I saw that day.  He recommended that I excersize when I feel one coming....but that doesn't seem to be fully effective yet.\n\nToday I've been working on my resume to get out of my job, but even just thinking about working on that makes me think about my job which and then turns into my crying on the floor.\n\nI've been perusing through the posts here....and I have another appointment with the Doc for Saturday.  Getting through work tomorrow will certainly be interesting. \n\nBut thanks for having the subreddit and posting your info.  \n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone....got through today.  Most of it was pretty rough until I finished a presentation in the afternoon.  Up until then, I was doing everything I could to just let the emotions work themselves out of me.  My chest didn't stop being tight until after 03:00...but right now I'm feeling the best I have all week now that I'm home and it's the weekend....\n\nWe'll see how I am on Monday, but now I'm focusing on my follow up appointment tomorrow morning.\n\nThanks for the support...and I'll keep reading!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "e4v8s", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Middle Aged Panic-Monkey", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s4u5", "hide_score": false, "edited": true, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "is_self": true, "name": "t3_e4v8s", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/PanicParty/comments/e4v8s/middle_aged_panicmonkey/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1289550025.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicParty/comments/e4v8s/middle_aged_panicmonkey/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "epicfale", "created_utc": 1289521225.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PanicParty", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.PanicParty", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "PanicParty", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I figured I could look around this subreddit page, but I felt I wanted to just explain and see if anyone has specific pieces of advice.\nTwo days in a row, I&amp;#39;ve had anxiety attacks in the middle of school.

I met a guy at the same bar that started all this who suffered, and he knew immediately what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 years later i still consider myself a sufferer.

If you feel like you&amp;#39;re lifestyle is worsening your attacks, ween them out 1 at a time. 2) Zoloft/Xanax - was put on both, never took the xanax (Hypochondria) and the Zoloft made me freak out and made it worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things that worked - 1) finding natural ways to lower BP.  I have naturally high BP and im positive it directly influences my attacks.  I did stop drinking caffeine for a long time, back on it now, and no probs here. 2) Exercise - helped me get past the first few months. i stopped regularly exercising since, but it definately helps. 3) DO NOT change your lifestlye 180degrees in a day.  its stressful on your mind and body, it will not help.  gradually move into a direction you want you life to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;there is probably more, but this is getting too long.\nI can honestly say (and i know a lot of people wont agree, and maybe hate me for saying it) that these attacks have made me a much better person.

You can NOT die from anxiety alone, this can not be stressed enough.  Talk to family, likeminded people or reddit, and understand that your attacks will be short if you make them so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i hope this helps some people... remember this is MY experience and techniques at dealing with it.  Im not dissing drugs or anyone elses treatment options.  This worked for me, and im proud of myself for being able to say im a better person because of it.

I keep getting called a hypocondriac, and at 20 years old, I already have pattern baldness.  Don't know if this is from the stress, or family, but it's terrible looking either way.  I've been putting off seeing a doctor, or a therapist, for a few years.  I've never really been on medication long-term for this, but it's effected me a lot.  I've had to drop out of school early (got my diploma though), can't apply for college, lost my job, etc.  I spend most of my days playing minecraft or other computer games to distract myself.  I'm getting more bad days closer together, and good days further apart.  I've tried to start my own business and get another job, but couldn't go through with it because of my anxiety.
