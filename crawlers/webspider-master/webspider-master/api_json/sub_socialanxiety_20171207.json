People despised me for talking too much, being too cheerful, or whatever... I keep thinking that I should just shut up, but people with social anxiety usually do that and it didn&amp;#39;t help them either... They kicked me out of the group, they used a 2 year old angry facebook post to justify it. They were afraid that I would hurt someone!? So they hurt ME!? Instead to teach me how to be a friend by being kind to me, they hurt me and gave me reasons to become an antisocial psycho... I ended up embracing my fear... I tried so hard to be nice, became too nice, got abused... if I end up hurting someone... they deserve it... because no one ever bothered to show me better...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had nasty experiences online too... Got harassed by a manipulator. Another one turned all my friends against me (they pressured me to forgive, to allow people to disrespect me, I was barely learning to be assertive to save my life...

I can walk through crowds and be surrounded by people all day and not feel any bit of anxiety, but as soon as someone tries to initiate conversation my brain freezes up. Sometimes when I&amp;#39;m in class I hear my classmates having conversations about things I enjoy and partake in, and sometimes I catch myself opening my mouth to let words out and join the conversation, but my brain tenses me up again and I&amp;#39;m not able to project my voice despite the words being at the tip of my tongue.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually don&amp;#39;t understand why I&amp;#39;m like this. I don&amp;#39;t want to be like this, I want to talk to people and make friends. But I literally can&amp;#39;t. Sometimes I try to think of what happened that made me turn out this way. So far the only thing I can think of is close friends abandoning me for newer friends in high school, and a few instances of bullying that took a hit to my self-esteem. I still don&amp;#39;t understand how any of these contributed to my development of social anxiety. People go through way worse and they&amp;#39;re still able to communicate with other people. I&amp;#39;m planning to go in for therapy as this &amp;#39;condition&amp;#39; is something I&amp;#39;ve never talked to anyone about, so maybe that will help.

Sometimes when I'm in class I hear my classmates having conversations about things I enjoy and partake in, and sometimes I catch myself opening my mouth to let words out and join the conversation, but my brain tenses me up again and I'm not able to project my voice despite the words being at the tip of my tongue.  \n\nI actually don't understand why I'm like this. I don't want to be like this, I want to talk to people and make friends. But I literally can't. Sometimes I try to think of what happened that made me turn out this way. So far the only thing I can think of is close friends abandoning me for newer friends in high school, and a few instances of bullying that took a hit to my self-esteem. I still don't understand how any of these contributed to my development of social anxiety. People go through way worse and they're still able to communicate with other people.

She&amp;#39;s also pretty cute and we talk a lot. Plenty of awkward silences as usual, but it never felt completely stale and we end up staying together for the rest of the event. We talk lots more and we leave together. She even begins talking about very personal problems like her dad&amp;#39;s heart attack and his upcoming bypass surgery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We walk towards the train we need and she says &amp;quot;Oh, I kinda wanted to take the train to [big city] Central Station, waste a couple of hours walking around the city centre&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally all I have to say at this points is &amp;quot;Sounds good&amp;quot; and it would have been a date.

It will change you, you won&amp;#39;t recognise yourself after doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when first doing this I was terrified. I had to go up to a stranger and give him a high five. I was sure something was gonna go wrong, it was like I had a nagging voice in my head from my past telling me &amp;quot;You cant do that&amp;quot;. But I went up for him asked him for a high five, he looked at me weird and said &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; than gave me a high five. It was such a small thing but it built up momentum for me to do tougher and tougher challenges until I was desensitized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re too scared to do it, or know it will be exactly what you need but are not going to do it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is too scary and you&amp;#39;re not gonna do it, don&amp;#39;t worry about it, just notice every time you are scared to do something like talk to a girl, you can at any time do this excercise. Just think &amp;quot;Im scared now but at any time I can decide to spend a day doing the rejection therapy excercise and overcome this forever by the next day&amp;quot;. I guarantee you wont last more than a year until you finally say ENOUGH and realise you need to fix this rejection. Just wait for the day you say &amp;#39;fuck it&amp;#39; and do this, you now have a way out of this trap of caring what people think at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GO WITH SOME FRIENDS! If I did this by myself I don&amp;#39;t know if I would have the courage to do it, but the social commitment of doing it almost forced me to overcome my fear, as my friends were there to see if I got too scared. Just don&amp;#39;t do the challenge in groups, make sure it&amp;#39;s just you doing it so you take the weight of the embrassment. (you can still do it by yourself obviously)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try taking cold showers, its a good way to condition your brain too take risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list may need to be personalized, eg if you&amp;#39;re afraid of being rejected by a girl, go up to a girl and purposefully get rejected, this list will cover basic fears of social rejection, but add more to put yourself in the worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;THEY&amp;#39;RE JUST STRANGERS YOU&amp;#39;LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN AND THAT TIME WILL PASS ANYWAY REGARDLESS OF IF YOU DO THE EXCERCISE SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO IT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benefits I&amp;#39;ve received from it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can now approach strangers with no fear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual confidence not just fake confidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much stuff I can do now that I couldn&amp;#39;t before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel less and less the need to impress people or &amp;quot;I need them to like me I need to be funny or cool to impress them&amp;quot; this point sounds kinda underwhelming but it&amp;#39;s AMAZING when actually live this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the voice telling me &amp;quot;No ones gonna laugh if you say that&amp;quot; so now I&amp;#39;m funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting more approval from others, paradoxically since I care less I now dont fake my personality, so am more authentic and thus more likeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even outside of social fears am more open to taking risks more confident more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its hard to convey how amazing this has been for me, this list may seem underwhelming but when it&amp;#39;s actually happening to you and you&amp;#39;re not reading about someone doing it it&amp;#39;s life changing.

Can you see yourself laughing with friends in town right now completely free from the fears that had been pinning you down previously, can you see yourself being an inspiration as you overcome fears that others have struggled with. \n\nNotice that right now reading this a choice has opened enabling you to completely radically change your life, if you've been asking how do I be confident THIS IS THE ANSWER!\n\nHave fun and know that even if you never do this exercise and remain anxious, I still love you and nothing can ever change that no matter how 'awkward' you may seem, I a total stranger am completely accepting of you :)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hx66g", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "How you can overcome social anxiety in two hours.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 6, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hx66g", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/7hx66g/how_you_can_overcome_social_anxiety_in_two_hours/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512584467.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7hx66g/how_you_can_overcome_social_anxiety_in_two_hours/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Heisenburger111", "created_utc": 1512555667.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialanxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.socialanxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7hwn0d", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "What are some quotes that help you get over social anxiety?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7hwn0d", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/7hwn0d/what_are_some_quotes_that_help_you_get_over/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512576098.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7hwn0d/what_are_some_quotes_that_help_you_get_over/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Anolem", "created_utc": 1512547298.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialanxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.socialanxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been holding me back for years.

Later when she saw me, she smiled at me to come over so I did, and she gave me a long embrace. And then we just stood there, looking around. It took me a while to realize what was happening, because I enjoy silence. But then I felt so horrible, and tried to think of something good enough to talk about that wouldn&amp;#39;t annoy her. Before I could, someone started talking to me, and the treasured friend joined that conversation, talking about me to this person but not talking to me, and telling this person things that they could&amp;#39;ve broken the silence with earlier but didn&amp;#39;t. Then another friend came to me and it was the same thing, they had conversations with each other over my head like a game of monkey in the middle. The treasured friend usually ignores my words when we&amp;#39;re at events together because I&amp;#39;m usually boring and awkward, but the other friend fake laughed when I failed my one opportunity to make a comment, and it hurt worse somehow. They asked me to come get snacks with them, so I did. But they started talking to each other and closed the gap so I had to walk behind them like a pet. When we got to snacks, they joked with each other and conversation flowed easily between them but I was on the outside looking in. The treasured friend mentioned that she hangs out with the other friend and I secretly wished that we could have that kind of friendship, but I know I can&amp;#39;t ask her to hang out because I&amp;#39;m so bad at talking. For a while they didn&amp;#39;t even look at me until the treasured friend asked me a question then quickly moved on before I had the chance to elaborate. When it was time for the treasured friend to go, she promised to text me later, then doubled back to show the other friend her new phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a particularly rough night, but it&amp;#39;s kind of been the last straw. I&amp;#39;ve known the treasured friend for two years, and our friend group is aware of my social anxiety and introversion. She and I have gotten closer over the past few months, texting every day for hours. But our friendship has reached a stand still because we don&amp;#39;t talk, only text. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that I&amp;#39;ve been typecasted as the person who doesn&amp;#39;t talk. People assume I won&amp;#39;t say anything and keep me around like an accessory, but if I break the silence with something stupid it&amp;#39;s even worse. The treasured friend will come and stand next to me but frequently ignores what I manage to say, has seemed to have given up on initiating conversations with me, while she&amp;#39;ll engage others all around me. Then the second we get home from a party I&amp;#39;ll get a message from her and we&amp;#39;ll text for the rest of the night. I want this to change, but I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. In public I feel paralyzed, like my thoughts can&amp;#39;t fit through my mouth. But my friendship is suffering because of it. She seems uncomfortable if I sit next to her, gushes to me about the friend(s) she treasures but doesn&amp;#39;t seem to value me highly, treats me like a middle man if she&amp;#39;s too scared to tell our mutual friend something. I need help. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; I text my friend everyday but can&amp;#39;t talk to her in person&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**This is going to sound EXTREMELY self-centered, I just need to go there because I'm hoping for an objective perspective on my irrational feelings.**\n\nA friend that I treasure the most asked me to come to an event, so I did. Later when she saw me, she smiled at me to come over so I did, and she gave me a long embrace. And then we just stood there, looking around. It took me a while to realize what was happening, because I enjoy silence. But then I felt so horrible, and tried to think of something good enough to talk about that wouldn't annoy her. Before I could, someone started talking to me, and the treasured friend joined that conversation, talking about me to this person but not talking to me, and telling this person things that they could've broken the silence with earlier but didn't. Then another friend came to me and it was the same thing, they had conversations with each other over my head like a game of monkey in the middle. The treasured friend usually ignores my words when we're at events together because I'm usually boring and awkward, but the other friend fake laughed when I failed my one opportunity to make a comment, and it hurt worse somehow. They asked me to come get snacks with them, so I did. But they started talking to each other and closed the gap so I had to walk behind them like a pet. When we got to snacks, they joked with each other and conversation flowed easily between them but I was on the outside looking in. The treasured friend mentioned that she hangs out with the other friend and I secretly wished that we could have that kind of friendship, but I know I can't ask her to hang out because I'm so bad at talking. For a while they didn't even look at me until the treasured friend asked me a question then quickly moved on before I had the chance to elaborate. When it was time for the treasured friend to go, she promised to text me later, then doubled back to show the other friend her new phone. \n\nThis was a particularly rough night, but it's kind of been the last straw. I've known the treasured friend for two years, and our friend group is aware of my social anxiety and introversion. She and I have gotten closer over the past few months, texting every day for hours. But our friendship has reached a stand still because we don't talk, only text. It doesn't help that I've been typecasted as the person who doesn't talk. People assume I won't say anything and keep me around like an accessory, but if I break the silence with something stupid it's even worse. The treasured friend will come and stand next to me but frequently ignores what I manage to say, has seemed to have given up on initiating conversations with me, while she'll engage others all around me.

The Wierdest part was all my other co workers acted like nothing happened so I texted her to ask if she as ok. Maybe it seemed worse to me then it did to everyone else but I'm still sitting  here an hour and a half later so anxious about what's gonna happen if I get yelled at. I don't think I'll be able to handle it, I get so much anxiety over these things.

My extended family have disconnected from me, my mum and sister.

It feels like people have been angry with me for being so anxious.\nAlso had &amp;quot;fake friends&amp;quot; throughout college due to a big fear of being seen as a loner. These people always invited each other to parties, but never me and spoke of it in front of me. One of them also said that I was boring on repeated occasions and when a lot with these &amp;quot;fake&amp;quot; friends they would never hang around with me. It was partially my fault I guess for that. I was like a loser, no one wanted to be with me, even in certain classes such as Art A Level I sat alone or a partner in class work openly said that they didn&amp;#39;t want to work with me. Writing this I feel angry, but the college I went to for the majority wasn&amp;#39;t bad and the people weren&amp;#39;t bad they just didn&amp;#39;t understand anxiety and in fact made jokes about depression.\nAs I have gotten older almost every workplace I have been in I haven&amp;#39;t been able to make friends or connect with others, partially due to anxiety. In a few jobs I also seemed to receive the silent treatment from a few people, which makes me angry as I didn&amp;#39;t do anything but be a bit anxious. Also sometimes I feel like I am treated like I am dumb. I also feel very frustrated since I feel really misunderstood, thinking about it I feel frustrated with most people. I also expect to be disliked by others. It&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m so closed in and anxious but because I have been like that for most of my life, it feels very natural and normal.

With Kitchen Portering, almost every temp assignment I had I was asked if I was studying and that I should be. Understandable since it&amp;#39;s undesirable work and most of the people I worked with were immigrant and weren&amp;#39;t always fluent in English. The job role was basic but hard since I had to be fast but usually wasn&amp;#39;t fast enough and also my body, particularly hands and legs were sore after shifts. I also left because of the under appreciation that came with the job, probably sounds like a pathetic reason and the fact that I felt more miserable in the job that when unemployed.

Finally, after sitting up there for about five minutes, I just thought fuck it, raised my hand and said \"Your Honor, may I approach?\" (this is something I never, ever would have done if I wasn't feeling so horrible)\n\nHe said okay so I walked up to the bench, the two lawyers joined, and said something like \"I have anxiety and I feel like I'm about to have an anxiety attack, I've been trying to keep it together but I can't do it and I just really need to get out of here.\" At that point my voice was faltering and my eyes were welling up with tears. The judge asked if I was alright, I said yes and that I just needed some air, and he let me leave. \n\nAs I walked out, I was shaking with every breath. I sat in my car for a while after and cried. I felt so horribly anxious and so embarrassed that I walked out crying in front of all those people. Now I don't know what to do when I get summoned again in the future. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. I wanted to get this off my chest and I'm also trying to practice posting stuff on reddit. Anyone have a similar experience? Any advice for next time? \n\nTL;DR: see title.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7h18x0", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Had jury duty, became unbearably anxious in the courtroom, told the judge and got dismissed.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 115, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 8, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7h18x0", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/7h18x0/had_jury_duty_became_unbearably_anxious_in_the/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1512226554.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7h18x0/had_jury_duty_became_unbearably_anxious_in_the/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "5b12", "created_utc": 1512197754.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialanxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 115}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.socialanxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I am around town walking about on my own I feel like I&amp;#39;m in a movie (not in a good way) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I feel like the absolute centre of attention and I can&amp;#39;t seem to zone out into my own headspace\nIt&amp;#39;s like torture sometimes, I feel so self conscious if I&amp;#39;m out for long it gets to the point I feel mentally exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing my stupid brain does on really bad days is it&amp;#39;ll take in people chatting among themselves and turn those snippets into negative comments about me -

I really thought I was making good progress. I surprised myself in so many ways. Making eye contact was bizarrely something I could do if I had to. I talked myself through every challenge. I forced myself to ask questions if I had them. Approaching and greeting customers was becoming easier and easier, I was doing it all of the time. I have met so many fellow workers, and even have friendly/polite dialogues with some. I am remembering names. I went from doing nothing with my time to abruptly working 40 hours.

For one, I was hired for something I deliberately didn\u2019t apply for and didn\u2019t want because I had no expertise in it. I didn\u2019t interview for this position originally. During my second interview, they asked where I wanted to work and I did not say this department (though it\u2019s desirable to others). I guess they were desperate or something, because the interviewer made a nonsensical leap in logic as to why I would be good for this portion of the store.

The reason I applied for the low-hanging fruit of retail was because it was something I felt I could do. Although some customers are easy, I have an apparent lack of knowledge in this area and am a burden on the rest of the team that works with me.

Nothing too in depth, but I did what was necessary. Some interactions were more natural than others. Every day I felt I made such progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing I didn\u2019t conquer is the fucking phone, lol. I wasn\u2019t trained on the protocol for that for awhile\u2026 I am still kind of unclear. A lousy excuse, I know. I tried to coast on that as long as I could. To be fair to myself, the training here has been poor and there isn\u2019t a lot of opportunity to ask questions. But the real issue is I am sort of telephobic, like many in this subreddit.

She implied I did not talk to people at all. She said not to worry, as they were going to change me &amp;quot;little by little\u201d (LOL good luck).

Just like working out your body\u2019s muscles, you can also work out this part of your mind. In time, your social skills will develop, enabling you in ways you\u2019re only imagining right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choice Architecture basically means designing your environment to force you to make certain decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to walk more? Sell your car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to stop eating junk food? Get them entirely out of your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to rid yourself of social anxiety, pick jobs that require you to open up more. This will essentially help your mind rewire itself. Being social is an exercise like any other. And as they say, \u201cuse it or lose it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first job was as a library page. This reinforced my social anxiety. Though it was in my comfort zone, I knew this was a bad idea. Next job was working at CVS, then next at JC pennys, then a host at a restaurant, then a sales person at Nordstrom.

Just like working out your body\u2019s muscles, you can also work out this part of your mind. In time, your social skills will develop, enabling you in ways you\u2019re only imagining right now.\n\nChoice Architecture basically means designing your environment to force you to make certain decisions.\n\nFor instance, if you want to walk more? Sell your car.\n\nIf you want to stop eating junk food? Get them entirely out of your kitchen.\n\nIf you want to rid yourself of social anxiety, pick jobs that require you to open up more. This will essentially help your mind rewire itself. Being social is an exercise like any other. And as they say, \u201cuse it or lose it.\u201d\n\nMy first job was as a library page. This reinforced my social anxiety. Though it was in my comfort zone, I knew this was a bad idea. Next job was working at CVS, then next at JC pennys, then a host at a restaurant, then a sales person at Nordstrom. See the pattern here?\n\nEvery new job forced me to open up more and more.

After the last time, I kept telling myself, if I get another chance, look at him! Smile at him! Do something to let him know I would be open to talking to him! And I couldn&amp;#39;t do it. And maybe he has no interest in me and wouldn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me anyway, but that&amp;#39;s actually completely beside the point. Why can&amp;#39;t I &lt;em&gt;LOOK&lt;/em&gt; at him? I paid attention to what I was thinking while I was studiously ignoring him, and at the time, when I&amp;#39;m faced with the actual possibility, I don&amp;#39;t want him to talk to me. I desperately don&amp;#39;t want him to talk to me. So I don&amp;#39;t look at him so that he won&amp;#39;t. Why? WHY? I want him to at any other point in time, when it isn&amp;#39;t an actual possibility. Why can&amp;#39;t I be normal? Why can&amp;#39;t I do a normal human thing?

We used to take the same train a lot more, now I only see him once in a while. We've never interacted, just seen each other at the station. Last time I saw him, he walked up to me and waited at the same place as me for the train to come. This time, he came and waited at the bench I was waiting on, until the train came, and then he moved off to a different car. BOTH times, I can't even so much as look at him, much less try to say something or smile at him or do anything other than studiously ignore him. After the last time, I kept telling myself, if I get another chance, look at him! Smile at him! Do something to let him know I would be open to talking to him! And I couldn't do it. And maybe he has no interest in me and wouldn't want to talk to me anyway, but that's actually completely beside the point. Why can't I *LOOK* at him? I paid attention to what I was thinking while I was studiously ignoring him, and at the time, when I'm faced with the actual possibility, I don't want him to talk to me. I desperately don't want him to talk to me. So I don't look at him so that he won't. Why? WHY? I want him to at any other point in time, when it isn't an actual possibility. Why can't I be normal? Why can't I do a normal human thing? Why why why why WHY can't I human?? And on the mostly impossible chance that he is looking for a signal...he's not going to keep looking for much longer.

Ever since the school year has started, the group has splintered and fractured because everyone is busy and has less time for friends. Now, the only time I really socialize with some friends from this group is at lunch each week day. At first, this was fun, but I quickly grew to dread seeing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll call them Bob, Marsha and Steve. Marsha and Steve are dating, and always together. They have a really sarcastic sense of humor and they gossip a lot. Their favorite thing to do is pick on me, but I&amp;#39;ll talk more about that in a bit. Bob was one of the first people I met here and he&amp;#39;s nice to me in private, but whenever we get in front of a group, he joins in on making fun of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever I hang out with all three of them together, they make fun of me somehow. I&amp;#39;m really shy, and I think I might have autism. I get so nervous during small talk that I will interrupt or forget to listen to the other person. I often overshare. And I&amp;#39;m so uncoordinated and clumsy it&amp;#39;s not even funny - it&amp;#39;s not really lunch until I spill something on myself. These are all things that they make fun of me for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been called &amp;quot;loser&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ugly duckling&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;weirdo&amp;quot;. They&amp;#39;ve pulled my chair out from under me, rested their feet in my lap when I was just trying to eat, taken unflattering pictures of me several times without my knowledge - usually when I&amp;#39;m eating, which is really bad because I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with an ED. (I don&amp;#39;t want to see myself eat.) They make me feel small and like the butt of the joke all the time. A lot of the time when I come to sit with them Steve will say &amp;quot;oh no SHE&amp;#39;S here&amp;quot; and that is weird because Bob usually invites me to sit with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told them a couple of times that this hurts my feelings, and that I want them to chill out. Bob will apologize but nobody else will. They invited me to hang out with them this Saturday to watch a movie, and I asked them why they invited me, and Steve said, &amp;quot;because we&amp;#39;re friends!&amp;quot; So... is this just normal teasing? Nobody else is being treated like this. Should I go? Maybe they&amp;#39;ll treat me better if I stick it out a bit longer...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Some people treat me like the people who bullied me in elementary school, but still invite me to hang out with them and swear we&amp;#39;re friends.

At first, this was fun, but I quickly grew to dread seeing them.\n\nI'll call them Bob, Marsha and Steve. Marsha and Steve are dating, and always together. They have a really sarcastic sense of humor and they gossip a lot. Their favorite thing to do is pick on me, but I'll talk more about that in a bit. Bob was one of the first people I met here and he's nice to me in private, but whenever we get in front of a group, he joins in on making fun of me.\n\nWhenever I hang out with all three of them together, they make fun of me somehow. I'm really shy, and I think I might have autism. I get so nervous during small talk that I will interrupt or forget to listen to the other person. I often overshare. And I'm so uncoordinated and clumsy it's not even funny - it's not really lunch until I spill something on myself. These are all things that they make fun of me for.\n\nI've been called \"loser\", \"ugly duckling\" and \"weirdo\". They've pulled my chair out from under me, rested their feet in my lap when I was just trying to eat, taken unflattering pictures of me several times without my knowledge - usually when I'm eating, which is really bad because I've been struggling with an ED. (I don't want to see myself eat.) They make me feel small and like the butt of the joke all the time. A lot of the time when I come to sit with them Steve will say \"oh no SHE'S here\" and that is weird because Bob usually invites me to sit with them.\n\nI've told them a couple of times that this hurts my feelings, and that I want them to chill out. Bob will apologize but nobody else will. They invited me to hang out with them this Saturday to watch a movie, and I asked them why they invited me, and Steve said, \"because we're friends!\" So... is this just normal teasing? Nobody else is being treated like this. Should I go? Maybe they'll treat me better if I stick it out a bit longer...\n\nTLDR: Some people treat me like the people who bullied me in elementary school, but still invite me to hang out with them and swear we're friends.

Over the past year and a half I have noticed something happening to me that I&amp;#39;ve never experienced before.  Essentially, when I am stressed out, I can feel my head and neck get so tight that it causes my head to tremble slightly.  It started out happening only when I was angry, and in an argument with somebody.  I don&amp;#39;t often argue with people so it only happened once in a great while.  If I paused and looked away from the person who was making me upset, my head would stop trembling.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple months and I am meeting my girlfriend&amp;#39;s employer, and he&amp;#39;s this real manly cowboy dude and surrounded by his cowboy buddies, and I basically walked up to this group of men, all of whom I&amp;#39;ve never met and introduced myself, and I noticed it was happening then too.  If I would look them in the eye, my head would tremble.  If I would look away, the trembling would stop.  But this ended up making me feel like I probably looked kinda stupid when I was talking to them, because I keep breaking eye contact and looking away, since I obviously don&amp;#39;t want them to see my head vibrating.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to be getting worse.  I was at Best Buy the other day, and the lady that was helping me look at the TV&amp;#39;s was kind of cute, and I felt it happen with her slightly, only when I make eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today at work, I felt it happen with one of the guys I work with, someone I&amp;#39;m very comfortable around.  Like I said, it seems to be getting worse.  I just don&amp;#39;t get what it is or what is causing it though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do understand that just making eye contact with someone you look up to (ie, manly kinda dude, pretty girl, your boss etc,) can make your adrenaline rush, but in the past that has never been something that manifests itself like this.  I don&amp;#39;t think the trembling is as obvious as it feels.  I have tried to recreate the trembling while looking in a mirror and it&amp;#39;s not entirely obvious, but I feel like it is when I&amp;#39;m in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple things about me.  I&amp;#39;m 25 year old male, 170lbs, decently attractive (at least I think so), and I have ADD.  I take 72mg of concerta daily, and ritalin in the afternoon if I need it.  I have persistent slightly elevated blood pressure, doctor says that is probably a symptom of the concerta.  Usually less than 130/85 or 90.  I can&amp;#39;t remember the bottom number, but I remember the top number is usually below 130.  Doctor has never freaked about the blood pressure, but says I should be watching what I eat and getting exercise.  I don&amp;#39;t exercise as much as I should, but I&amp;#39;m still in decent shape.  I eat a relatively healthy diet.  I&amp;#39;ve always had the confidence to walk up and talk to any guy.  Any guy will tell you, talking to pretty girls is harder, and it has always given me little butterflies but not to the point that I avoid it.  It&amp;#39;s never kept me from dating,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#39;m worried about, because it seems to be progressing and I have lately been avoiding situations that would bring about this trebling sensation, just because I&amp;#39;m worried it will happen, which I&amp;#39;m sure just makes it worse.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couple questions.

Frequently our insecurity will prefer not to share our opinion, idea, thought, value because we are comfortable by not going out of our comfort zone. The fix for this is being in the present moment, living in the now. Not the past because of something you already said or the future because of what you think may come up.

People LOVE to talk about themselves), help the other person talk about themselves and the conversation will flow and they will love you. Talking about yourself the whole conversation is selfish, you need two people talking to form a conversation. Sometimes we retain ourselves from asking questions for some reason, when asking questions is the exactly what we need to do in order to push the focus away from ourselves and allow the other person to talk about themselves. The questions we ask in a conversation usually come from past experiences and the environment we are in, and when we don\u2019t have any idea what to say, its useful to have some questions up your sleeve.

This is key when it comes to social skills; understanding people\u2019s behavior in order to reveal what they&amp;#39;re really thinking and feeling. Before getting to the point where you comprehend behavior, on a basic level, one can observe superficial aspects such as clothing style, facial expressions, and body language. For example: take a look in the posture people take when sitting down. A laid back position indicates relaxation, a inclined and forward position indicates attentiveness when engaged in a conversation, if they\u2019re wearing a college t-shirt you can continue the conversation by asking the major or college he or she is attending. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4 F.O.R.D&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a great tool to have as a reference when trying to find topics of conversation.

Okay so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been kind of an socially anxious tense nervous &amp;quot;brain damaged&amp;quot; kid. My mom never breastfed me, dad was never home working all the time, earliest experiences with others outside immediate family like other children bullied me, girls / first crushes and love like laughed at me and were super mean like giving back my gifts on valentines day or and laughing and screaming at me to get away and the whole class uproaring in laughter, pretending to like me or ask me out in front of their friends, adult teachers being incredibly mean to me making me cry often and embarrassing me, wow, so, I guess I got a little less tense and awkward and anxious around people as I grew up, but it was still kinda always there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a in a fish bowl of high school / college, I had friends. Everyone had commonalities - we were all either learning cool subjects and Majoring in similar things, going out to get wasted and do ridiculous hilarious fun things and chase girls, or in high school it was all about liking the same bands, having inside jokes about the same movies laughing about them together and quoting them, liking similar bands, video games, relationships, movies, similarities like that - like meeting people in your same classes from almost being forced to see them again and again and again, finding common interests, going out outside of school to just hang out and do whatever.. Then you&amp;#39;d work some minimum wage job, meet a few people that way, interact and joke with them or interact with them or whatever, same thing being &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; to see them over and over and over again, so you naturally sort of become close and friends, often at places like the gym or at school, right? So then comes my next step in life after college: Get a career, right? Well, because the social anxiety thing was always with me causing distress, I began to spend a lot of time in my 3rd / 4th year of college in my room. I&amp;#39;m a MASSIVE introvert. I&amp;#39;d still socialize and stuff but since it was ALWAYS painful and I was forced around others through school or work, I decided to try to end the pain by spending more time alone to get relief and pursue personal goals like music, reading, art, and making money online. My roommates would joke and say I wouldn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;come out of my cave&amp;quot; and stuff. I decided instead of doing some stressful job around the chaos of other people all day, which exhausts me, I&amp;#39;d build an internet company. Turns out it was a massive success. I made $100k my first year. Right out of college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought my own apartment, then a house, all on my own, new areas. I was really scared to go out and be seen vulnerable in distress and stuff I rarely did. Just like to the market, and maybe the beach.\nI&amp;#39;m not a virgin. I used to get drunk and had a lot of random sex. I can get the engine going if I needed to. Being alone all the time though and having a sex drive, I began to view pornography and masturbating. It became an addiction. I mean who doesn&amp;#39;t want to view beautiful HD women doing stimulating things in the privacy and comfort of your own house? I kept putting going out and meeting people in the future &amp;quot;when I.... [insert excuse]&amp;quot; because it was so uncomfortable and stressful and not enjoyable for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay so fast forward. The damage has been done. Looking back I have been 4-5 years next to totally alone, I&amp;#39;ve seen no one but my parents occasionally, the internet business kinda tanked and I&amp;#39;ve been living back at my parents house I&amp;#39;m almost 30 years old.\nI now suffer from intense depression. I guess as we age we begin to decline. My brain was always fragile. Now even more so. Mental health challenge. I became a workaholic trying to rescue the internet business (Think me in a room spending time on a computer allllllll day...... totally alone) anyways now I am suuuupppeeerrr exhausted and depressed most of the day. I am like weak and terrified to leave my front door. My looks, youth, and hairline are starting to go. I&amp;#39;m now at the point where I see groups of more adult &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; people my age like going out to amazing places, going on Friday night dates, I just can&amp;#39;t take the isolation anymore. And I don&amp;#39;t know how to get out of it. The obstacle is that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) I&amp;#39;m very sick, intensely depressed and tired, most of the day. I&amp;#39;m weaker than most other people my age it feels like :(. I don&amp;#39;t have as much stamina. I can&amp;#39;t party like I did in college. I have to go to bed early. Who cares? I feel like an old man. So if I begin making friends / dating, how would I keep up with them, and wouldn&amp;#39;t any woman my age just hop over to the next normal, socially functioning guy who with a job and friends and who can take her on all these amazing dates and have sex way longer pleasing her more than me and stuff? So I thought baby steps step one for me would be just making friendships and building social skills, networking, just starting going out of the house again, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) I have NO IDEA where to go to meet people in the adult world, to make friends, especially being challenged like this so I can practice and build social skills. Sitting in a room alone all day typing on a screen and &amp;quot;making love&amp;quot; to pixels has made me somewhat weird, or at least conditioned to be different from most everyone else, I&amp;#39;m sure. So, back to the point, where does any adult go, who missed a career, to meet people and make friends and build his social skills? Like I said I am pretty sick with depression, I can hardly have the physical energy or stamina to do much so I don&amp;#39;t think working a job all day around people is feasible, plus, aren&amp;#39;t people miserable at their jobs anyways? My parents said I can die in this house and inherit it. I have a car. But where do I go? I feel so weird at this point, isolated, cut off, disconnected, I don&amp;#39;t fit in anywhere. I&amp;#39;ve literally thought about suicide. I don&amp;#39;t know why anyone would want to be my friend, especially as I get uglier, older, and weaker, more tired, less fun right? I mean, in the adult world, other than immediate family and work, do people even have friends? I literally don&amp;#39;t know anymore what to do, or how to fix myself and fit in again and find love and community. I think I am just going to go walk around theme parks or something. Maybe start going to concerts and hope for the best? But these are events, how would that work for a consistent social network or circle and me being able to practice in a safe learning environment, where I&amp;#39;m not bullied and laughed at by other functioning incredible people? I feel like this Earth has left me nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk up to people limping and challenged super vulnerable and shy, it&amp;#39;s super sad and probably I&amp;#39;m not an immediate pick to be a top choice friend or lover. If you read this far, your input could literally be saving my life, I mean if I approached you at a bar or something, would YOU want to invite me over to hang out or be my long-term lover? I&amp;#39;m so depressed / exhausted nervous and tense around others these days guys, seeing everyone out laughing and normal on a Saturday night is killing me guys, thank you so much for your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PEACE.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I'm kind of in a serious situation.

My mom never breastfed me, dad was never home working all the time, earliest experiences with others outside immediate family like other children bullied me, girls / first crushes and love like laughed at me and were super mean like giving back my gifts on valentines day or and laughing and screaming at me to get away and the whole class uproaring in laughter, pretending to like me or ask me out in front of their friends, adult teachers being incredibly mean to me making me cry often and embarrassing me, wow, so, I guess I got a little less tense and awkward and anxious around people as I grew up, but it was still kinda always there.\n\nWhen I was a in a fish bowl of high school / college, I had friends. Everyone had commonalities - we were all either learning cool subjects and Majoring in similar things, going out to get wasted and do ridiculous hilarious fun things and chase girls, or in high school it was all about liking the same bands, having inside jokes about the same movies laughing about them together and quoting them, liking similar bands, video games, relationships, movies, similarities like that - like meeting people in your same classes from almost being forced to see them again and again and again, finding common interests, going out outside of school to just hang out and do whatever.. Then you'd work some minimum wage job, meet a few people that way, interact and joke with them or interact with them or whatever, same thing being \"forced\" to see them over and over and over again, so you naturally sort of become close and friends, often at places like the gym or at school, right? So then comes my next step in life after college: Get a career, right? Well, because the social anxiety thing was always with me causing distress, I began to spend a lot of time in my 3rd / 4th year of college in my room. I'm a MASSIVE introvert. I'd still socialize and stuff but since it was ALWAYS painful and I was forced around others through school or work, I decided to try to end the pain by spending more time alone to get relief and pursue personal goals like music, reading, art, and making money online. My roommates would joke and say I wouldn't \"come out of my cave\" and stuff. I decided instead of doing some stressful job around the chaos of other people all day, which exhausts me, I'd build an internet company. Turns out it was a massive success. I made $100k my first year. Right out of college.\n\nI bought my own apartment, then a house, all on my own, new areas. I was really scared to go out and be seen vulnerable in distress and stuff I rarely did. Just like to the market, and maybe the beach.\nI'm not a virgin. I used to get drunk and had a lot of random sex. I can get the engine going if I needed to. Being alone all the time though and having a sex drive, I began to view pornography and masturbating. It became an addiction. I mean who doesn't want to view beautiful HD women doing stimulating things in the privacy and comfort of your own house? I kept putting going out and meeting people in the future \"when I.... [insert excuse]\" because it was so uncomfortable and stressful and not enjoyable for me.\n\nOkay so fast forward. The damage has been done. Looking back I have been 4-5 years next to totally alone, I've seen no one but my parents occasionally, the internet business kinda tanked and I've been living back at my parents house I'm almost 30 years old.\nI now suffer from intense depression. I guess as we age we begin to decline. My brain was always fragile. Now even more so. Mental health challenge. I became a workaholic trying to rescue the internet business (Think me in a room spending time on a computer allllllll day...... totally alone) anyways now I am suuuupppeeerrr exhausted and depressed most of the day. I am like weak and terrified to leave my front door. My looks, youth, and hairline are starting to go. I'm now at the point where I see groups of more adult \"normal\" people my age like going out to amazing places, going on Friday night dates, I just can't take the isolation anymore. And I don't know how to get out of it. The obstacle is that:\n\n1) I'm very sick, intensely depressed and tired, most of the day. I'm weaker than most other people my age it feels like :(. I don't have as much stamina. I can't party like I did in college. I have to go to bed early. Who cares? I feel like an old man. So if I begin making friends / dating, how would I keep up with them, and wouldn't any woman my age just hop over to the next normal, socially functioning guy who with a job and friends and who can take her on all these amazing dates and have sex way longer pleasing her more than me and stuff? So I thought baby steps step one for me would be just making friendships and building social skills, networking, just starting going out of the house again, right?\n\n2) I have NO IDEA where to go to meet people in the adult world, to make friends, especially being challenged like this so I can practice and build social skills. Sitting in a room alone all day typing on a screen and \"making love\" to pixels has made me somewhat weird, or at least conditioned to be different from most everyone else, I'm sure. So, back to the point, where does any adult go, who missed a career, to meet people and make friends and build his social skills? Like I said I am pretty sick with depression, I can hardly have the physical energy or stamina to do much so I don't think working a job all day around people is feasible, plus, aren't people miserable at their jobs anyways? My parents said I can die in this house and inherit it. I have a car. But where do I go? I feel so weird at this point, isolated, cut off, disconnected, I don't fit in anywhere. I've literally thought about suicide. I don't know why anyone would want to be my friend, especially as I get uglier, older, and weaker, more tired, less fun right? I mean, in the adult world, other than immediate family and work, do people even have friends? I literally don't know anymore what to do, or how to fix myself and fit in again and find love and community. I think I am just going to go walk around theme parks or something. Maybe start going to concerts and hope for the best? But these are events, how would that work for a consistent social network or circle and me being able to practice in a safe learning environment, where I'm not bullied and laughed at by other functioning incredible people? I feel like this Earth has left me nowhere to go.\n\nI walk up to people limping and challenged super vulnerable and shy, it's super sad and probably I'm not an immediate pick to be a top choice friend or lover. If you read this far, your input could literally be saving my life, I mean if I approached you at a bar or something, would YOU want to invite me over to hang out or be my long-term lover? I'm so depressed / exhausted nervous and tense around others these days guys, seeing everyone out laughing and normal on a Saturday night is killing me guys, thank you so much for your feedback.\n\nPEACE.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7fw2s3", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Feel Like Hiding All The Time.

I mainly face problems at school because that&amp;#39;s where most of my social interactions are. When ever I walk past someone I&amp;#39;m not sure whether I should look at the person and smile or look away so I end up awkwardly staring at them and now I&amp;#39;m afraid that everyone gets a bad opinion of me from it. When I am talking to people I always stare at them too much because I don&amp;#39;t know when I&amp;#39;m meant to look away and I start getting worked up about it and I end up not hearing what they say. When ever I&amp;#39;m sitting down and there are people around, by habit I stare at people and then sometimes they notice and I&amp;#39;m afraid that they think I&amp;#39;m being very creepy or trying to be aggressive. Especially when the person is a girl, I get very scared that they get the wrong idea about me. Especially when I do it to the same person more than once, I don&amp;#39;t know why but I&amp;#39;m more likely to stare at someone who has already caught me staring at them. I&amp;#39;ve really tried to stop but I have a very short attention span and I end up doing it subconsciously and I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop. I&amp;#39;m really scared that I&amp;#39;m going to get myself into trouble doing this and I don&amp;#39;t like making other people feel uncomfortable. How do I fix my eye contact problems?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another problem I have is that I hate myself. Seeing or hearing myself in a photo or video makes me cringe. I also feel like a weirdo from a different species because I feel like I don&amp;#39;t fit in and I sometimes think that I&amp;#39;m just overreacting with these feelings and I&amp;#39;m scared others will think the same if I tell them about all of this, I&amp;#39;ve been very conscious while writing this that you think I&amp;#39;m overreacting. If I&amp;#39;m ever talking to someone and people I don&amp;#39;t know are in the room I talk very quietly because I&amp;#39;m scared that they will hear and judge me. When ever I mess up I feel like like a useless failure. I also always get flashbacks to times where I think I messed up or when something cringey happened when I&amp;#39;m alone and shout something like &amp;quot;shut up!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no!&amp;quot; which is really mentally draining. How can I raise my self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Sorry if this paragraph makes you cringe, I was unsure whether I should add this part because I&amp;#39;m cringing a lot thinking about the fact that other people might read this, but I&amp;#39;ve forced myself to because I really want to get it off my chest.) I am also too shy to talk to girls. I have never had a girlfriend or tried to ask a girl out because I am too scared. I really feel like having a girlfriend that I can talk to, empathise with me and love me while doing the same for her or at least having someone to hug without feeling self conscious of rejection would fill a massive hole in my life. I think that it could fix a lot of my problems but when ever I like a girl my eye contact problems intensify and I stare at her a lot when she isn&amp;#39;t looking but once she sees me I instantly look away because I find it overwhelming. Last year I had a massive crush on a girl and I ended up staring at her a lot then looking away whenever she looked back. I would always go to where ever I thought she would be so I could stare at her (I know it sounds really creepy, but she was so unbelievably beautiful.) I also always daydreamed about her, imagining she was my perfect girlfriend making her even more intimidating in real life. I made it my goal to smile at her once before she left school (it was her final year last year) but I never got the courage to even do that let alone talk to her so I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m going to ever manage to do it and I&amp;#39;m scared I&amp;#39;m going to be alone until I die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to get a diagnosis to see if I have social/general anxiety disorder and possibly others (which would need a whole other post to talk about) but I feel like the doctor will think I&amp;#39;m overreacting and I&amp;#39;m too nervous to talk to a doctor about it. I have talked to my dad about booking an appointment with a GP but nothing has happened yet. Is there an easier alternative or do I have to man up and do just do it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(This is really random so you can skip this paragraph and not miss out on any problems). I was thinking of a way to find out if someone else had anxiety without asking them: If you talk to someone else that is struggling mentally but is too afraid to talk about it and you wonder if they have the same struggles as you, this could mean that they are wondering the same thing about you, so what could be a way to find out that you are both having these problems? If the other person has the same problems and each of you know that each of you are wondering about the same thing, then you could come up with a discrete signal to show the other person has the same problems that someone who didn&amp;#39;t have the same problems wouldn&amp;#39;t notice. So you both now need to predict what the other persons signal is going to be so you need to come up with a signal that the person can predict. This could be for example blinking twice when you see them. This all relies on the other person coming up with the same logic, however. I probably sound insane for just thinking about this but has anyone else thought of something along these lines? I thought it would be really cool if I actually got this to work but it can&amp;#39;t work if nobody else has thought of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate anyone who can help me with any of my problems.

Now this has happened and it just adds to the list of failures I&amp;#39;ve managed to accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a crush on this guy at work for a few weeks. It may be because of my naivety as a result of social anxiety, but I felt he was being a bit nicer to me. He was outgoing and talked to everyone, and so I could never be sure about the signs. I caught him looking my way and he mirrored a lot of the things I was doing, but again, because of my own insecurities I could be reading too much into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tried talking to me a couple of times, but the conversation would stop after I responded as I usually just ran the hell away from there or didn&amp;#39;t say anything to make the conversation worthwhile.

Although, I did get this sense that he was also insecure and that he simply acted outgoing around everyone to cover it up. He often looked at others as if to seek approval, and this was one thing I was fairly certain of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time when we saw each other on the way to work, he looked at me and seemed embarrassed, but then quickened his pace and actually took a detour as if to avoid me. I didn&amp;#39;t look directly at him but I was quite certain he saw me. Another time I thought I saw him walking behind me, and, remembering the time he avoided me, I acted as if he wasn&amp;#39;t there and quickly opened the door. Perhaps it was rude of me because I opened the door rather quickly. He would have been a few steps behind me. I walked upstairs and saw some people who I thought was saying hi to him, but I quickly realized it was me, because he was no where near me. This convinced me that he was avoiding me.  On the same day however, he came over to talk to me about work stuff and although I was aware he liked to walk around to talk to people, it was the first time he actually came close to me. I looked at him but he didn&amp;#39;t look my way as he kind of awkwardly stared at my computer. It&amp;#39;s embarassing for me to think that I assumed he liked me just because he would comment on what food I was eating or that what I had in my hand. He talked to me twice that day about trivial work stuff, but of course I thought that was him being extra nice to me, being so quick to fantasize and exaggerate. He makes excuses to talk to other people too... Maybe I just looked like I wanted a friend so he was being friendly. Idfk anymore because his validation to me would have meant the world. Sadly, I didn&amp;#39;t get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This whole situation made me uncomfortable and I wanted to bail from work because of general social anxiety as well as the tension (from my perspective) between the two or us. Except for this one time when I quickly mentioned something, he always initiated the conversation. I assumed he was getting tired of this. I even thought I heard him talking about my shyness and rudeness with other guys. I gave myself a number of reasons why he wouldn&amp;#39;t like me. It often seemed as if he was overly relaxed in my presence. He would make big jerky movements, often eat and cough loudly. Bad etiquette, maybe, but it gave me more doubt as to whether or not he liked me in that way.  It was so confusing to me, and because I never once tried to talk to him when we bumped into other outside the main office space, we said our awkward goodbyes last week, as we were both leaving the company. I saw him warmly engaging with the other co-workers but with me it was simply a cordial &amp;quot;nice working with you (my name)&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately I felt regret. I wasn&amp;#39;t in love, but my confidence level plummeted because I was so lonely and I thought I had finally found someone who accepted me. It was as if my whole world was about to get shattered as a result of my ego breaking piece by piece as I walked slowly away from the office building. That day I followed him on Snapchat and he still hasn&amp;#39;t followed me back. I can&amp;#39;t continue this vicious cycle anymore. I fall for guys and I end up running away because I could even try talking to them. At least if this guys rejects me, I&amp;#39;ll get closure. A few friends encouraged me to add him on Snapchat, but I feel creepy now because I obviously looked him up, but there&amp;#39;s a chance he hasn&amp;#39;t seen his followers yet so I kind of just want to delete him, all the while I&amp;#39;m screaming for help and I just wanna confess to him. If I get rejected that is still closure. I just do desperately want to find out if he has a gf and isn&amp;#39;t interested in me. For once I need to get an answer. I feel like I&amp;#39;m falling down the rabbit hole only it&amp;#39;s just help waiting for me on the other side, because this is no fairy tale and I&amp;#39;m no Alice.

I have never really known any good methods of making friends, but in elementary school it was easy; I just went up to a couple kids I had heard talking about some stuff I was interested in and said: &amp;quot;want to be friends&amp;quot;? And it stuck without any issues for 4 years. I switched in 6th grade to a private middle school, losing all my friends in the process. I sat alone at lunch for most of the year before another kid that was mostly alone approached me and made the process of being social easy.

At this time, the only interaction I had with anyone outside of family was one of my old friends from middle school. We talked online and played video games sometimes. I started to eat lunch alone and never really talk to anyone. I have been afraid to just go talk to someone. Everyone is in a group, and these groups are most always larger than what I am comfortable with. They are noisy and I feel I would never get a word in. On top of that, I am not even sure what I&amp;#39;d say.

This isn&amp;#39;t my only avenue to easily make friends but it seems like it&amp;#39;d be SO easy... I just can&amp;#39;t help but being stoic, having very dry or very sarcastic humor, and being pretty socially awkward, so people don&amp;#39;t tend to gravitate towards me on first impressions.

I think that if I made some friends, or at least had some gratifying social situations at least a couple times a week I wouldn&amp;#39;t need any medication. I only had depression symptoms set in once I became so socially isolated in 9th grade.

I&amp;#39;ve just been so depressed lately. I feel like sleeping constantly. A friend who struggled with similar problems reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to talk or get help. She said she could get me an appointment with her doctor. I said no I&amp;#39;m fine and bullshit like that. I don&amp;#39;t know how to ask for help. I started smoking and those moments are the only tranquility I have during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate myself so much. I have been so irritable. Tomorrow night there is a concert and I asked a few of my friends. They all gave bullshit excuses. I know that no one has to hang out with me whenever I want but getting rejected on so many fronts in such quick succesion is driving me mad. Two friends sent me messages like you have our support and we are rooting for you or whatever and that only makes me madder. They are so fucking hypocricital. They can&amp;#39;t be arsed to do anything. Fuck I know I&amp;#39;m wrong in thinking this but I can&amp;#39;t help it. I know that I have to get through this myself.

NO matter how much freakin awkward it gets, and how embarrased I feel, I will maintain eye contact even if its going to kill me. ain&amp;#39;t gonna lie, at first it was very hard, felt so damn awkward, felt like the person infront of me thinks im a weirdo for staring at him, felt so awkward, but as time passed, it started to feel very less awkward, and much more natural. today, over a year since I did it, I don&amp;#39;t even think about eye contact, it just happens pretty much automatically. btw the reason I made this method is by reading that how humans body language work, and I&amp;#39;ve found out that the first side to look down is feeling inferior, so I&amp;#39;ve decided I&amp;#39;ll just stare untill the other side looks away and by doing that showing some kind of dominance, and it worked! and my confidence has raised a lot because im guessing in some way my body is convinced its superior by never looking away first and just because I never have this fear anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck guys, be strong, be brave, and don&amp;#39;t give a fuck what anyone else thinks about you, its your life, and only you can decide what the hell you want to do with it, burst into a dance in the street with your headphones on, because you want to! let others think whatever they want because you don&amp;#39;t give a **** what he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I posted this here a while back, thought i'd share it again for people to see.\n\nHey guys, thought i'd share some of the methods I came up with dealing specific social anxiety.\nWhen I was younger I had this terrible feeling that everyone's judging me, looking at what I do, whenever I went to the club or a bar with my friends and someone laughed at the background, I was confident im the one they're laughing at and just felt really bad about it.\n\nSo I got really tired of this shit, and I decided enough is enough, and basically what I did is whenever I felt someone is judging me I just told to me self (sorry for the language, but its literally what I said to myself) - I don't give a fuck.\nfor example - if a person looked at me at I felt he thinks im a weirdo, well, I dont give a flying fuck, oh this other dude is laughing at me? well, go see if I care, I just didn't care what people think about me anymore, I mean, so what if he doesnt like my shirt? so what if he thinks im weird? so fuckin what? his problem, I couldn't care less, my life, I decide what I want to do with it.\n\nas time passed, I started to build confidence, because I simply don't care what others have to say anymore, I started fooling around in public, singing loudly in my helmet while riding my bike because I don't give a *** what the dude in the car next to me thinks, even if that makes him laugh, so friggin what? my life, I enjoy doing that, not gonna see him again in my life anyway.\n\nThat being said for that part of anxiety being cured, I also had a problem in places such as my work place, I usually came to work, not greeting anyone, maybe a small barely heard good morning and thats it, just kept being embarrased from everyone at work, feeling like they see every move I make.\n\nSame here, decided i've had enough and it cant keep being like this.\n\nSo what I did here was basically to pretend!

He doesn&amp;#39;t cut me much slack either. He thinks I shouldn&amp;#39;t have any excuses for my occasional irresponsible or confused behavior, but sometimes I can&amp;#39;t help making mistakes. I&amp;#39;m young and figuring life out after a traumatic childhood and broken relationships with most of my family. I also have some mental health issues...anxiety/ depression that I believe to be brought on by hormonal imbalances. I think these may be things I will struggle with my whole life. I thought I was doing better (went a while without having an emotional break down) until last night. \nI wont get too into it, but basically we went to my boss&amp;#39;s thanksgiving party, I got really stoned and my partner and I got into a small argument (I wasn&amp;#39;t including him in enough conversations) and then I was hit by severe social anxiety... it didn&amp;#39;t help that I felt he was intently watching and judging me (he truly does that). He started to talk to a female coworker of mine who asked me on a date a while back and when I told him about it he said I should ask to have her to have a threesome with us...that&amp;#39;s a whole other story.... but it was just a fantasy and something that never came into fruition because we both would go back and forth about if we really were ready for that and she had never offered the possibility in the first place. He knew who she was though and went and sought out a conversation with her. I joined in and started to feel really uncomfortable. I felt like he was comparing me against her.

I'm a very self-conscious person (which I am working on) and my partner can be very judgmental...not necessarily in a bad way, but he see's things very logically and doesn't like to look past or gloss over anything anyone does/says. He doesn't cut me much slack either. He thinks I shouldn't have any excuses for my occasional irresponsible or confused behavior, but sometimes I can't help making mistakes. I'm young and figuring life out after a traumatic childhood and broken relationships with most of my family. I also have some mental health issues...anxiety/ depression that I believe to be brought on by hormonal imbalances. I think these may be things I will struggle with my whole life. I thought I was doing better (went a while without having an emotional break down) until last night. \nI wont get too into it, but basically we went to my boss's thanksgiving party, I got really stoned and my partner and I got into a small argument (I wasn't including him in enough conversations) and then I was hit by severe social anxiety... it didn't help that I felt he was intently watching and judging me (he truly does that). He started to talk to a female coworker of mine who asked me on a date a while back and when I told him about it he said I should ask to have her to have a threesome with us...that's a whole other story.... but it was just a fantasy and something that never came into fruition because we both would go back and forth about if we really were ready for that and she had never offered the possibility in the first place. He knew who she was though and went and sought out a conversation with her. I joined in and started to feel really uncomfortable. I felt like he was comparing me against her.

I shut down, panic and cry in the bathroom everyday wishing I wasn\u2019t alive so I didn\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019ve tried several fields (office admin, retail, call centre) and I\u2019m at a point where I just don\u2019t know what to do or where to go. Every job I see advertised I dread applying for but I do it because I have too. I guess I just want to know if there\u2019s anyone else like me who\u2019s struggled but eventually found themselves and what they could stick too? I feel like I really do not know myself or what I want/am capable of doing and that terrifies me. I am 23 years old now like what the fuck am I doing??

I had regular flu nothing bad or special ,it lasts only for week,but after that my life changed . I started to feeling tired almost every day and that provoked my anxiety even higher and  decreased my confidence even more . I had sometime disorientation mostly in city. Than about month later i decided to visit doctor and it was a lot of tests mostly bloodworks, i dont remember exactly ,but i still have results stored...  It was doing me more lazy obviously. When i was 14 to 15 i worked out regurarly 3-4 times per week. My diet didnt change i ate regurarly food nothing special nothing junky...\nMy results were very low almost unnoticeable for male . Friend which started working out has better shape after month. I was not satisfied with my body i  hate it for that. I learned a lot of things about bodybuilding nutrition training etc. I realized that my structure and shape of muscle seems more like women structure . I am not joking :D My dad has the same shitty genetics ,beside that my brother is normal ...... Anyway that&amp;#39;s not the point of this post.\nBut the real things starts to crushing when i went to high school and to hostel. I was nervouse all the time about new classmates and getting well wit them... In hostel we don&amp;#39;t have keys on WCs and you couldn&amp;#39;t lock there and even that makes me anxious about going to do what everyone needs to do :D It&amp;#39;s crazy right ? After a month i started to have digestion problems like congestion , intestine bloating overall discomfort 24/7 . It hits me har mentally and my anxiety increase a lot ,whole class i was just twisting on my chair. So i visited gastroentologist ,he said me that i am watching myself too much ,and from blood test everything seems to be ok. I was pissed so i visited another  gastroentologist. Even before that i get reflux/acid burning my thorat which  gives me even more fear and pain... So i have done enoscopy and colonoscopy and it founds that of course i have reflux :D wau... Everything else was ok. She prescribed me pills for lowering gut acid. They didn&amp;#39;t work at all i thing it only were worse. I stopped taking them and few months later it was almost normal . Well in 2. grade of my study my neck starts to hurt and was stiff and it hurts my lower back too but it wasn&amp;#39;t that bad ass neck. It sucked my energy and mood and whole days were just horrible for me . I have knew that i shoukd exercise (yoga,stretching) etc... But i just was too demotivated and lazy so i was doing it occasionally. Next i visited psychiatric because i knew that my psychic state is very bad,she prescribed me SSRI sertralin. Firs motnh of usage &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have done rontgen but my bones are ok . Well after 2.grade i was doing massages few times a week for 2motnhs and i could functional normally. At the end of summer August i started to smoke weed 2-4 per week , i really liked that feeling of high and apetite ,eating bunch of food and listening to music. But i get few bad trip even one with suicidal thoughs. I forgot to mention that i found kratom - miracle plant for me i taked it few time per week. On Kratom everything seem&amp;#39;s to be normal like i dont even have any problems ,beside of congestion which was worse when using kratom. 3 Weeks ago i started do decrease my dosage of sertralin.\nWeek ago my reflux came back ,i felt really anxious one day. I thing this could do weed  which interconnect with my dopamine and sertralin levels. Or maybe kratom too ,but i don&amp;#39;t think so because i read that people are taking Kratom with SSRI witout problems. But everyone is different so it could be case too. Now i feel that i returned 1 year back. When i am on kratom it&amp;#39;s still acceptable but my reflux doesn&amp;#39;t seems to cooperate good with it.\nI eat really clean ,using karrot to stabilize my acid and ginger . \nI don&amp;#39;t feel exactly the same of course like year ago because i have a lot more knowledge but it&amp;#39;s furstrating :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s pretty much it.

\n\nEdit: I just realised that when I say big groups it can be anything that invovles 3 people or more", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7evj1z", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Is my anxiety bad enough to tell my GP, if it's even actual SA?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 12, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1511434646.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7evj1z", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/7evj1z/is_my_anxiety_bad_enough_to_tell_my_gp_if_its/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511424589.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7evj1z/is_my_anxiety_bad_enough_to_tell_my_gp_if_its/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "coffeels", "created_utc": 1511395789.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialanxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.socialanxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really dont want to see any family on thanksgiving as it will be hell for hours on i rather just stay outside or do anything to not see them plus i hate seeing people i havent seen in a while&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Really dont want to see any family on thanksgiving as it will be hell for hours on i rather just stay outside or do anything to not see them plus i hate seeing people i havent seen in a while", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7eu56c", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I hate thanksgiving how do i survive the pain?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7eu56c", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/7eu56c/i_hate_thanksgiving_how_do_i_survive_the_pain/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511412461.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7eu56c/i_hate_thanksgiving_how_do_i_survive_the_pain/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "MindInHell", "created_utc": 1511383661.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialanxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.socialanxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=\"/r/socialanxiety\"&gt;r/socialanxiety&lt;/a&gt;,\nI am writing today because this year was the happiest I&amp;#39;ve lived in my entire life and wanted you to tell you about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This year I started middle school and had to change to a new school as the one in which I did my elementary was getting too expensive for our family.

Now I couldn&amp;#39;t say I had just made friends as we were just making small talk and nothing serious really.

But one of my friends then who I call my best friend now pushed me to talk to her, for which I hated him for at the moment. But now, I owe him my overcoming of this.

I said &amp;quot;h-hello&amp;quot; and she responded with the same, but in a brighter tone and without the stutter. She was quite extroverted. I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting much in the conversation that followed but she was quite nice so I talked to her in recess many times and we became really good friends.

When I was in 6th grade (I am a senior in high school now) this happened to me and I didn&amp;#39;t really have friends until the end of 7th grade. Because of this, I am super terrified of lousing friends again. I&amp;#39;m scared of being alone. I have some pretty bad anxiety and for a while, I was talking to two of my friends about it because they both had experienced crippling anxiety. Long story short I shouldn&amp;#39;t have relied on them to help me solve my problems because it ended up damaging my friendship with them. For months now I have been working to regain this trust, this friendship, but every time I start making some progress, I will accidentally say something or do something that ends up putting me back where I came from. One of them said to me a few days ago &amp;quot;do I have to block you on everything again just to get you to change&amp;quot; as a joke (i forget what the context was but it was clearly a joke), but I didn&amp;#39;t really think that was funny. Frankly, it scared me because it seems to be kind of true. He had told me that as much as he wanted to help me. he couldn&amp;#39;t deal with my problems anymore, but he still wanted to be my friend. And for a week I had stopped talking to him about my anxiety, but then relapsed really bad. That was when he was advised to block me (by a school mental health counselor) until we could sit down and have a conversation about it. We have had that conversation that even I knew needed to happen, but ever since then, he (and my other friends) seem to be drifting away (and not they normal type when people change) like what happened to me in 6th grade. I should make it clear that i&amp;#39;m not screwing things up like I did the first time when I was relying on them to be my counselor, these screw ups are way way smaller. For example, I was playing the game planetary annihilation with a few other people and I was the first to die. This meant I could spectate and see what everyone was doing. Since he was almost certainly going to win because of his experience, I didn&amp;#39;t think it was a big deal to tell my other friends what planet he was on since they were way far behind and were going to louse. Rightfully so, his response was &amp;quot;Im not going to ever play with you again if you are going call out all of my moves. no one will.&amp;quot;  It doesn&amp;#39;t help that today I was on Oxycontin because I got my wisdom teeth out today. I don&amp;#39;t ever plan on doing that again, and made that clear so it was probably just an overreaction but it is things like that which are standing in my way of mending my damaged friendship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I need some advice on how to mend my friendships and some advice on how to not let my social anxiety run my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks,\nA Social Wreck &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\nI'm getting really desperate for advise on how to cope with my social anxiety and how to mend friendships.\nAs the title says, my problem lately is I always feel like my friends are leaving me, even when they aren't.

I need to get this off my chest. \n\nHolidays are coming. This means, in my case at least, tons of family/work/friends events. My family is pretty big on holidays, we have several events for Christmas, new year, Epiphany...Same for friends; I'll probably be invited to 2-3 Christmas events minimum.\n\nOn top of this, it just so happen that most of my friends (+my brother, one of my uncle, and myself) were born in this time of the year. Just today, I've been invited to 4 birthday parties, each happening somewhere between December 20th and January 15. Which triggered this text post. My head is hurting already, just thinking about it, I want to puke. I know this is only the beginning.\n\nBut I'm thinking I'm probably not alone in this. I don't want this post to be only about me.

My stress and anxiety have been so bad that my doc had to up my dose. I have never really suffered from social anxiety until recently and it is nearly crippling. I wake up most days and just want to cry because I have to go to work and deal with, well, bullying. As a 30 year old woman, I\u2019m dealing with bullying and I never really had to as a kid. There were a few meanies but not to the extent of what I\u2019m dealing with now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work as a cashier at a pharmacy. I\u2019m currently trying to get certified as a pharmacy tech because state laws where I\u2019m from don\u2019t require schooling to complete certification, they just require employment at a pharmacy and an 80% on the tech exam. I just started my \u201cjourney\u201d if you will to certification. This is just one of many things I\u2019m ridiculed for at work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022I\u2019m not entrusted to accept payments towards patient accounts or to go get change on my own, even though it is in the cashier\u2019s job description. I finally confronted the tech that wouldn\u2019t allow me to do this and, after 8 months of working there, she is allowing me to do it. \n\u2022I am constantly corrected and nitpicked over every patient interaction I have. One of the techs, \u201cR\u201d, will watch me from the corner of her eye all day and if I say something in conversation other than \u201cDate of birth? Have any questions?\u201d she will correct me. Sometimes I\u2019m the only true human interaction that the patients get. Sometimes they like being joked with and talked to like a person, especially in a hospital setting. My boss loves my interactions with patients and they love it too. I never cross lines asking them what they are in for or anything too personal. I\u2019ve worked in sales and retail before and am an extrovert. I know how to talk to people. Patients know me and they love that I know who they are and have a smile for them when they come in. I don\u2019t understand what is wrong with being friendly and genuine to people. \n\u2022When I ask for help or insight while studying for my exam (my boss allows me to do so in my downtime at work) R makes me feel like the biggest idiot in the world. She talks to me like I\u2019m a child and straight up said \u201cYou will never be able to get this on your own. Just take the course.\u201d I already have a bachelor\u2019s degree but in something I realized I didn\u2019t want to do half way through my last semester. I know how to study and I have a pretty sharp memory. It really pissed me off that she would say this. \n\u2022R and one of the pharmacists, D, are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; passive aggressive. If you do one thing wrong, they will act short and rude to you for the rest of the day, no matter how small the mistake. Example:\n      -We were planning a joke on one of the other pharmacists by replacing a full box of flu shots with empty ones to see her reaction. I asked her if she had any flu shots today and both R and D pulled me in the back room and reprimanded me for \u201cruining the joke\u201d. I didn\u2019t ruin the joke. The other pharmacist hasn\u2019t even opened the box or even made an indication that she knew what I was talking about. All I did was ask if she had done any shots. That was it. R hasn\u2019t said one word to me since she chewed me out and D is making me feel about 2 feet tall every time I have to talk to her. \n\u2022Rules change. One day it\u2019ll be ok for me to study and ask questions, then the next day the girls are mad at me because I\u2019m studying and \u201cnot doing my job\u201d aka standing at the cash register waiting for a patient to pick up their meds. Sometimes an hour or two will go by with no patients and I can only dust and stock so much before I run out of stuff to do. Again, my boss gave me the go-ahead to study so I\u2019m not breaking any rules. \n\u2022I\u2019m not allowed to take an afternoon break. The other girls do and can but if I try to, I\u2019m called back to my post every time a patient comes in. I\u2019m legally allowed to take two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. It was in my contract. This also applies to bathroom breaks. I go to the restroom for two minutes (do my business and wash my hands) and they\u2019re screaming for me to come back up front. That\u2019s right: some days even going pee is unacceptable. \n\u2022They talk about me when I leave the room. I\u2019ve walked in on it several times. Sometimes they won\u2019t even wait for me to be out of the room. If I make a mistake, they whisper about me while I\u2019m in earshot. I feel like minor mistakes are treated as major, unforgivable mistakes. \n\u2022I\u2019m treated like their bitch. I\u2019m ordered around all the time. \u201cPut the drugs away\u201d and I\u2019ll go to put them away and get yelled at for not watching the counter. \u201cRefill the vials\u201d so I do and they are mad that I didn\u2019t leave one or two at the pharmacy station in case they need it during the whole 30 seconds I\u2019m gone to refill them. \n\u2022I get blamed for every little mistake. The computer system crashed a few weeks back and it was my fault for not calling the company to fix it. The thing is: it has never been my responsibility to do this. Every time we had problems with the system, a pharmacist or the tech person (who wasn\u2019t there that day) would call and get it fixed. I\u2019m not a computer person and not once have I ever been in charge of fixing the computers. I was frozen out by the girls for two days following the crash. We also had an intern that week. She was putting drugs away in the wrong spot. Guess who got corrected and blamed for that? That\u2019s right: ME. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly just don\u2019t know how to socialize with people anymore. I have been corrected and reprimanded so many times by my coworkers that I\u2019m terrified of conversing in any other way other than the robotic questions and conversation I have to make now. My patients have caught on and I\u2019m constantly asked if I\u2019m ok to which I respond, \u201cI\u2019m fine. Credit or debit?\u201d It physically and emotionally pains me to have to be so reserved. I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to be myself. My friendliness and people skills were something I was very proud of. Now I feel like an annoyance and terrified of interaction, not only with patients but in my personal life as well. I am treated like such a failure and a loser and an annoyance by people that are supposed to be helping me. I want to finish my tech certification but I also do t want to deal with the amount of mental turmoil and social anxiety that has been brought on by daily torture. I\u2019ve never, ever been afraid to talk to people and never felt so socially anxious and depressed in my life. I don\u2019t know what to do about it. It\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m withdrawing and not socializing anymore because I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019ve just been annoying all along. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I\u2019ve been a social butterfly my whole life and have always felt like I did good work at my jobs. My coworkers\u2019 constant reprimands and corrections towards my job and socializing with my patients is causing overwhelming social anxiety.

It\u2019s ruining my self esteem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve spoken to my boss many times and she doesn\u2019t know what to do either. Shes very passive and doesn\u2019t want the confrontation.

Are there any good ones? Benzos are obviously good for anxiety but they don't make me feel any more inclined to socialize. \n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7e7fef", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Do any medications for social anxiety actually work?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 14, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r22n", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1511171233.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7e7fef", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/socialanxiety/comments/7e7fef/do_any_medications_for_social_anxiety_actually/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511194781.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/7e7fef/do_any_medications_for_social_anxiety_actually/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ronan_the_writer", "created_utc": 1511165981.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/socialanxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.socialanxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school, I would go out sometimes, but it was mostly due to me asking if anything was going on.

I find it easiest to be funny and confident when the conversation is light-hearted and not serious, joking and teasing but with a filter of unspoken unharmful intention.When people switch to normal conversation I feel out of place. I make stupid jokes and chat shit but people don&amp;#39;t respond or get awkward themselves, because they are the opposite and are only good at normal conversation. I feel as though whatever I say is not worth very much and I say it really fast and mumble.

Basically, since i have been in this school all the way since Preschool i never got to really know girls, and honestly i didn&amp;#39;t care until recently, when we started to go to parties and stuff like that. (I didn&amp;#39;t really take much priority over my social life when i was little, i just didn&amp;#39;t care. And now i tend to more care on my studies than actually beign social). I remember that whenever i try to talk to girls i just tend to feel akward, out of place, like i dont know what im doing there or what to say. It feels like im just standing there creeply watching everybody talk while i just stand there without saying a word.(Because they&amp;#39;re normaly talking about stuff wich i&amp;#39;m not really interested in, so i really cant relate to what they are saying.) So i just slowly back up before i even say a word or just i dont even attempt to talk to them, i know it sounds stupid but i just can&amp;#39;t bring myself to talk to them, even if some of my friends are there i just feel out of place, almost as if they&amp;#39;re speaking antother language. Beign an introvert i have very few close friends which enjoy the same hobbies as i do (drawing,memes, and other dumb stuff) so i dont normally learn about new stuff, and i tend to just try to ignore some of the &amp;quot;highschool drama&amp;quot; (that will often be what they will be talking about). The only one time that i can acctually remember talking to a girl about something and feeling comftable was when i went to an academic tournament, for once i had something to talk about, something to have in common. She gave me her Snapchat, (something which i rarely us, but i appreciated the gesture) i thought i would have a female friend, but as the tournament had ended i just got kind of disconnected, i didnt have anything else to talk about,i tought it would feel odd to talk to her about something else, like she would see me as some kid of creep. I still wanted her to be in touch but once again i just got lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly i would like to say that i tend to overthink things, like when i think about gathering up the courage to talk to a girl, &amp;quot;will she see me as some kind of creep?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Will i look akward?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; What does she think of me?&amp;quot;, so many questions that by the time im done thinking either i just decide to not go, or the oportunity has flown out of my grasp. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks i really needed to get this off my chest, sorry for the nasty mess of a post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Im a 14 (male) and i have some really bad anxiety when it comes to talking to girls.\n\nBACKGROUND\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \nI have recently started to notice how anti-social i am with girls, i have never had any kind of problem when talking to my male friends, but i have never really had any female friends since my shcool is basically separated by genders, we go to the same school and everything, but we never got to talk to the girls (at least in school),the only time we acctually get to see each other in school is when we're going home, and the teachers will always tell you to go to your different dispatch areas if you're talking to the girls.

I&amp;#39;ve never had an issue falling into a certain group of people, finding pace with an event or party, or relating with someone&amp;#39;s story. Hell, even being the center of attention used to be nothing for me. I used to love having a good time, or being loud and doing something dumb/fun/crazy with friends or even other people I just met. I welcomed smiles and laughter, I never had a problem being involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I have ALWAYS treasured my isolation and staying in my home. It has been my number one favorite thing, regardless of how social I chose to be on a certain day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But lately, things are different. A few years back, I suffered through a 5 year relationship that just went into the shitter. I moved to TN for a new start, since it was where I was born. When I got here, I went out alone a lot. Id go downtown, party, drink, hook up with people, and wake up in strange places. I loved the uncertainty of my impulsive behavior. But it was from heartbreak. I was doing everything I could to forget. 3 years went by, I stopped hooking up with people because I didnt feel any emotional connection anymore. Back before that relationship, I fooled around a lot and I used to not give a shit about feeling connected with someone. I tried to do it when I got to the city and for a while it was fine, but with each casual encounter, it chipped away to being pointless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a mental breakdown at a call center job, not surprising I know, I didnt come out of my room for 2 weeks. I eventually moved past it and met someone. We&amp;#39;re in love and still together. She&amp;#39;s just as introverted as I am, and surprisingly more social than me now if she chooses to be. We just like our time together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside me, though, something is different. I&amp;#39;ve read that social anxiety is along the lines of fear of judgement or fear of an event, something you have to endure. Im beginning to feel this now, but it&amp;#39;s not fear that I feel. Just the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, I planned this big cookout at my place. No one but close friends and family. But even as the cookout got closer, my anxiety went through the roof, even on the day we were preparing for it. Once the cook out began, everything was great. We had a wonderful time, my anxiety was gone. But it was almost crushing before it happened. I get this anxiety with almost anything nowadays. If the phone rings, if I see the mail get delivered, if someone walks by my house, if I hear a knock at the door, if I have to go somewhere (even grocery shopping). It&amp;#39;s there gnawing at me. Once Im out and about, I settle into it just fine. But it&amp;#39;s always present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talking to people is still something I love to do, although I now stammer and trip over my words a lot. I know what I want to say, I correct myself and apologize, I don&amp;#39;t feel the embarrassment or fear. But in a social situation, my anxiety crushes me if I feel compelled to begin a conversation. I always have opening points to make in introductions or casual talk before falling silent, because I haven&amp;#39;t thought of anything else to say. I end up asking random, vague questions, hell I even turn to commenting on the weather. The gab is still there, it just feels... rusty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every now and then Ill analyze something stupid I said, or something I SHOULD have said but didn&amp;#39;t. And Ill feel stupid for staying silent. I feel like I miss out on opportunities now, or chances to do something special or experience something different, because the anxiety I get before it happens prevents me taking those chances or saying yes to the opportunities. Sometimes I hate myself for a choice I made when there were other paths I clearly could have taken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my bad days, I wanna stay home, stay inside and just ignore the world. I&amp;#39;m always waiting for something to go wrong. I no longer want to do anything too crazy or social because I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;ll end up lost in a crowd, or hugging a wall, which is worse. If I&amp;#39;m swept up in the current of wherever I am, I have no issue accepting it and having fun, that old me comes out again and everything becomes great. I know that person is inside me somewhere still. But it&amp;#39;s all pointless because the anxiety I get beforehand just shuts me down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I developing social anxiety? Is this absence of fear but consistent feelings of anxiety a common thing for other people? Or am I just an asshole looking for excuses to be lazy?

I don't understand how it can be this, but it feels like it. \n\nThough I've never felt judged, humiliated, inferior, etc in any of these situations, I have almost always definitely felt depressed.\n\nAnyways, if anyone responds, thank you. I just wanna know what this is.\n\nTL;DR- 26 year old extrovert, think Im developing social anxiety. Youd have to read for details and examples. But is this possible at 26?\n\nEDIT: Grammar", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7dg3ke", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Im 26, and have never had a problem being social.

It's just so annoying not being able to be myself out to others, I create all these gestures and possible was my hopeful encounters will end up, but I never am able to initiate anything...

Even if it\u2019s something like needing to wash my dish when they\u2019re standing in front of the sink. I feel like asking them politely to move is rude. I know it\u2019s ridiculous, and people think of me as a very self-less and nice person because of it, but at this point I am EXHAUSTED with myself. I\u2019ve recently come to the realization that most of my life, I\u2019ve been a major people-pleaser. This came in handy while I was still in school (all the teachers loved me and I got generally good grades), and I have a great relationship with my parents because I never really disappointed them (besides getting tattoos and piercings as my own small rebellion..) but it\u2019s very hard to deal with now that I\u2019m living on my own in \u201cthe real world\u201d. It\u2019s VERY hard for me to make friends because instead of being authentically myself around people, I go into a strange inner panic mode where I try to say things that I think would interest them and make them \u201capprove\u201d of me, which makes my mind go blank and suddenly I\u2019m feeling very socially anxious and have nothing to say because I don\u2019t know how to just relax and be myself anymore. I\u2019m constantly trying to break free from this thought-trap by telling myself I am equal to everyone else in the room and that they have no power over me, but it\u2019s still difficult a lot of the time. I take forever to fall asleep at night because as soon as my head hits the pillow, my mind has gotten accustomed to starting to &amp;quot;plan out&amp;quot; what kind of a person I will be next (outgoing and exciting, quiet and reserved, badass, sensitive and sweet, etc..). And I tell myself over and over to just relax and be me, but the thing is, I don\u2019t know what my personality is or who I am because I\u2019ve spent a big chunk of my life being who I thought other people wanted me to be. How can I break free from this? It\u2019s driving me insane. Even if everything else in the world disappeared and there was nothing to distract me from being myself, I still wouldn&amp;#39;t know how to just be me. I have very few friends and even when I\u2019m alone I can\u2019t act fully natural\u2026 It truly feels like I have no real personality. Why did I spend so much time and energy on feeling responsible for how other people see me, and trying so hard to make sure they see me as a cool person? I have no control over that. And yet I can\u2019t seem to end it. When there is anybody in the same room as me, I immediately start trying to come up with what would make them feel comfortable, or make them see me as a cool person, or make them like me. And then when I put those ideas into action, I&amp;#39;m an awkward mess. Any tips and tricks from past people-pleasers out there (other than sending me over to the howtonotgiveafuck subreddit haha)?

Even if it\u2019s something like needing to wash my dish when they\u2019re standing in front of the sink. I feel like asking them politely to move is rude. I know it\u2019s ridiculous, and people think of me as a very self-less and nice person because of it, but at this point I am EXHAUSTED with myself. I\u2019ve recently come to the realization that most of my life, I\u2019ve been a major people-pleaser. This came in handy while I was still in school (all the teachers loved me and I got generally good grades), and I have a great relationship with my parents because I never really disappointed them (besides getting tattoos and piercings as my own small rebellion..) but it\u2019s very hard to deal with now that I\u2019m living on my own in \u201cthe real world\u201d. It\u2019s VERY hard for me to make friends because instead of being authentically myself around people, I go into a strange inner panic mode where I try to say things that I think would interest them and make them \u201capprove\u201d of me, which makes my mind go blank and suddenly I\u2019m feeling very socially anxious and have nothing to say because I don\u2019t know how to just relax and be myself anymore. I\u2019m constantly trying to break free from this thought-trap by telling myself I am equal to everyone else in the room and that they have no power over me, but it\u2019s still difficult a lot of the time. I take forever to fall asleep at night because as soon as my head hits the pillow, my mind has gotten accustomed to starting to \"plan out\" what kind of a person I will be next (outgoing and exciting, quiet and reserved, badass, sensitive and sweet, etc..). And I tell myself over and over to just relax and be me, but the thing is, I don\u2019t know what my personality is or who I am because I\u2019ve spent a big chunk of my life being who I thought other people wanted me to be. How can I break free from this? It\u2019s driving me insane. Even if everything else in the world disappeared and there was nothing to distract me from being myself, I still wouldn't know how to just be me. I have very few friends and even when I\u2019m alone I can\u2019t act fully natural\u2026 It truly feels like I have no real personality. Why did I spend so much time and energy on feeling responsible for how other people see me, and trying so hard to make sure they see me as a cool person? I have no control over that. And yet I can\u2019t seem to end it. When there is anybody in the same room as me, I immediately start trying to come up with what would make them feel comfortable, or make them see me as a cool person, or make them like me. And then when I put those ideas into action, I'm an awkward mess. Any tips and tricks from past people-pleasers out there (other than sending me over to the howtonotgiveafuck subreddit haha)?

I had wanted to go into the military but the thought of having to stand at attention and not be freely allowed to drink has prevented me from that. I have a trip coming up that I am stressing about solely due to the fact that you can't take a water bottle through airport security. I need help how do break my dependency on this? Has anyone else experienced something similar to this or am I the only one? Please help.

I had cried when I got the email, because I was scared she would yell at me and call my parents  (I had been lying to them about attending classes and passing tests/quizzes). I was scared beyond belief when I walked into my major&amp;#39;s office and heard the dean of chair call my name. I tried to keep a bold face and act like I was alright. Surprisingly, she was very nice when questioning me about missing classes, because she knew it wasn&amp;#39;t like me. I burster into tears in relief. (I usually see her screaming or scolding other students a lot. Even though she&amp;#39;s been nice to me before I was extremely scared about our meeting.) She eventually convinced me to make an appointment with one of the school&amp;#39;s counselors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to 3 counseling sessions, a lot of health center appointments because I&amp;#39;ve been missing weight, and 2 psychiatrist sessions.

I had began to fear that My classes would start judging me, because I&amp;#39;ve missed so many classes. This was actually The first semester where I had a classes with no friends. I just felt vunerable like someone was going to attack me at any second. So i decided to stay in my room. The only time I left was to microwave food to eat. My day would consist of me mostly sleeping, watching Hell&amp;#39;s Kitchen, and practicing my Japanese. I was scared that My roommate would judge me, so I put on clothes and took out some old classwork and placed it around my side of the room to make it look like I actually went to classes. I sometimes have my tablet out with a PowerPoint from one of my classes and made sure it was facing my roommates side of the room and was pretending to take notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it felt really nice to just stay in my room all day and not interact with people, even my friends. The weather is getting colder where I&amp;#39;m at and I&amp;#39;m really considering just not leaving my room at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had only meant to be a one time thing, but I kept missing days and dreading the day my phone sends me an email notification from the dean of chair. This time the only times I left was to check my mail and go to the cafeteria to eat with some close friends. Even then I would be in my phone with earphones on to avoid conversation. When I&amp;#39;m asked how my day and classes were I would lie and say they were doing great. I would only turn in assignments that were posted online. I know I&amp;#39;ve missed a lot of in-class quizzes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends constantly invite me to friend functions on campus, but I always decline to hole myself back in my room. I actually accepted on offer last week. One of my friends works at the bowling alley in the student center of my uni. I had assumed it would only be my friends going to the bowling alley. The bowling alley is for any student to go to, so a lot did come, because the bowling alley is usually closed. I sat down near my friends, took a book and my headphones out, and began to read while not even interacting with anyone else in the room. I was doing good for about 20 minutes until more people cane into the bowling alley, packing the small room. I eventually felt like I was suffocating and getting migraines from all the yelling and the sound of bowling balls hitting the pins. Without a word I put my stuff away and quickly left. I made sure that none of my friends saw me leave. I went back to my room and felt safer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, I had found out that the females of my friend group had went to the mall yesterday and an all you can eat sushi bar. I was perplexed, because I wasn&amp;#39;t invited. Before this school year I was basically the only girl in my friend group. The girls who joined this school year were sorta acquaintances of my friends who officially joined the group. I was actually excited to do girl type things like shopping, because it&amp;#39;s something I never really did. I asked one of them why I wasn&amp;#39;t invited, because I would love have gone to the mall. One said they didn&amp;#39;t think I would like the mall, because of all the people and that I didn&amp;#39;t seem like the shopping type. I was slightly offended but understood what they said. I tried to argue my case and they said I simply did not seem like the type to like the mall, because of how they&amp;#39;ve seen me interact with strangers around me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the topic of me going to Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret and buying things. When I said I would my whole friend table had shocking looks on their faces like they say a unicorn or something. Then they all came to the conclusion that I would just buy lotions or something or that I had accidentally walked into the store. It pained me to hear my friends talk about me like that. It made me realize that My friends had not been inviting me to majority of their friend outings, because they believed that I would simply not like the crowds of strangers based on how I act around others. It made me feel like the group didn&amp;#39;t really like hanging me because I seemed like a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fear that I&amp;#39;m beyond help at this point.

One of my fears is disappointing my parents. It&amp;#39;s their money that is paying for my school.

I moved to a new town and did not fit in whatsoever. Also, my mom was a heavy alcoholic while I was growing up, so that may have factored into it as well. I do not appear to be &amp;quot;awkward&amp;quot; by myself per say, but I am constantly anxious and self-aware around groups of people and in conversations. Increased heart rate, racing thoughts, sweating, and even tensing of the neck occur when I am extremely anxious in a social situation. Also, when I am speaking to someone and I am anxious, I cannot think of words to say and I am often out of breath, although I am a great speaker around family. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past summer, I began receiving voluntary mental health treatment for the first time. At this time, I had just finished my first year of college and was struggling socially. I had not made any friends (literally, I couldn&amp;#39;t name one) and practically avoided all social activities. After the year ended, I decided to take action because this could not continue. My first experience in mental health treatment was at a state university behavioral health center. I had no option but to go here because my insurance had just expired a month prior and I was in the process of changing insurers. I was assigned a registered nurse to administer medication, who I would see once every other week, and a therapist, who I would see once a week. During this program (I was in the program for ~1.5 months), I was diagnosed with social anxiety, which I knew I long had. I was prescribed the normal starting SA meds: low dose Zoloft, Gabapentin, and other useless (to me) meds. None of them were effective whatsoever. I&amp;#39;m not sure if university facilities prescribe anything like benzos or strong meds, as that increases their liabilities. The nurse didn&amp;#39;t listen to any input and didn&amp;#39;t even know my name. Predictably, this may be the nature of large, state-run mental health facilities, where caregivers treat countless patients. The therapy was not that bad, but I didn&amp;#39;t really benefit from it. I essentially just learned what thinking patterns induce anxiety in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only beneficial thing I received from this program was being suggested to be tested for ADHD. I had much difficulty concentrating and focusing, I was distracted by nearly everything, I had no organizational ability, and I had an issue with hyperactivity, specifically constant fidgeting. Lastly, I could not concentrate on one thing and this significantly affected my first year academics (got a 3.5+ GPA, but failed a class and retook it to repair my GPA). I managed to do well without studying for anything because I just couldn&amp;#39;t sit down to open my books or do anything. After I started my second year this past September, I was tested at an ADHD/Mood Behavioral Center and was diagnosed with ADHD. I still didn&amp;#39;t have insurance, so I had to pay for the 3 sessions I used. Since this is a SA subreddit, I won&amp;#39;t bore you with most of the details. However, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed 3 medications: Concerta 20mg and two different dosages of Vyvanse, of which I no longer take. Also, the caregiver was also a registered nurse, not a psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After these 3 very costly sessions, my insurance finally cleared and I discontinued my treatment at this ADHD center. I found a fantastic psychiatrist and had my first session about a month ago. She is so knowledgeable and caring, which makes my treatment much more smoother. Since the Vyvanse I was on (prescribed by ADHD center nurse) wasn&amp;#39;t effective and didn&amp;#39;t last very long, I was first prescribed Adderall IR 20mg twice a day (she thought 2x IRs may last longer than an ER, as Vyvanse didn&amp;#39;t previously last long) and Prozac 20mg for my social anxiety by my new psychiatrist. Since she saw my previous meds for SA, she first prescribed Prozac because it was an &amp;quot;oldie, but goodie&amp;quot; and has helped many. I have yet been to a party and have not drunk a single drop of alcohol during my first year of college, so I am very responsible. The nurse at the previous ADHD center blatantly stated she would not prescribe Adderall as a treatment solution when evaluating my options, although I had not made any suggestion of that whatsoever. It was because I was in college and it is heavily abused, which is partially true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist prescribed it on my first visit and evaluation, which bolstered my trust in her. Let me tell you, if I felt anything on Vyvanse, it was trumped by the effect of the Adderall. However, I still felt it wasn&amp;#39;t effective to where I wanted it to be and it did not last very long (~4 hours per 20mg dose, which is typical). Also, the routine of taking it was too volatile. I&amp;#39;d take a pill in the morning, then crash hard, then take my second dose, come up, then come down again, and I would still have classes to attend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my great, second visit this past Tuesday, the 2x a day Adderall IR 20mg was substituted for 30mg Adderall XR. This was because although I wasn&amp;#39;t having any side effects to the IR, the 2x IR was not lasting long, and I felt I could go up in dosage, since I was still having many issues. The XR has been working significantly better than the IR, with no side effects. Next, she thought it was best to increase the Prozac dosage from 20 to 40mg for SA, as some people need a higher dosage for the drug to be effective. Lastly, but most importantly, she thought it would be good to prescribe 0.5mg of Klonopin (Clonazepam), to be used as needed. I&amp;#39;ve never taken a benzodiazapine or any SA med of this capacity (I assume benzos are at the top of SA treatment). I am to take this to &amp;quot;test the waters&amp;quot; in a way and see how I react. Although the dosage is really low IMO and I can go up much more, this has been the biggest change yet in my life. I had classes the other day, and I felt like I was set free (sorry for the cliche). No constant self-awareness, nervousness, anxiety, etc. I literally felt the way I should feel. I was talking to people with significantly less anxiety, so that I could actually make witty and intelligent conversation without stumbling over my words and being nervous of what to say. I can certainly say this drug can be the biggest change in my life--ever. I&amp;#39;ve suffered for too long in isolation, bogged down by this terrible phobia. I know part of it needs to be addressed in therapy and self-improvement, but this drug can assist in ridding, or at least curbing my SA. Also, I have to mention that I had perfect--if not higher than usual--mental acuity. I know benzos have a connotation for being &amp;quot;feel good&amp;quot; drugs that get you high, but I was functioning as I usually do, just with less social anxiety. I felt like the Adderall XR and Clonazepam acted synergistically, as I was more attentive in class and did my Calc. III HW quicker than usual. Maybe this is due to the higher dose of Prozac also, which my psych also prescribed because it can reduce symptoms of ADHD, on top of combating SA. However, it&amp;#39;s only been 2 days since I&amp;#39;ve been taking the increased dose, so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s had any effect, as it takes time to build in your system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will call my great psychiatrist tomorrow (said I can call anytime, for anything) and ask what I can do in terms of the Klonopin. I will express all of my experiences and try to see if there is a long term solution, with daily or multiple day frequency and higher dosages. I have a follow-up in a month, but I really don&amp;#39;t want to wait another month to address this. I&amp;#39;m sure she will agree and make some change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to know what is the typical dosage of Klonopin for SA (above 0.5mg, as that hasn&amp;#39;t been overly effective), how many times a day it should be taken (duration--increases with higher dosage?), and how many days a week it should be taken. I absolutely am aware of the dangers of benzos, which is why many psychs avoid prescribing them completely. Addiction is sometimes unavoidable and withdrawals are hellish, and can even be deadly. However, with proper guidance, I know this will work for me and improve my quality of life 10-fold. I&amp;#39;d take side effects and withdrawals (although I will be responsible) over life with social anxiety: not attending a single party in high school, not going to prom, not making a single friend in college, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if I was to take Klonopin daily, how long can this treatment be sustained? Is it possible to take the drug indefinitely, or is there a point to discontinue the drug? I really hope this, or something similar, can act as a long-term solution.

Again, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nSince about the 6th grade, I've dealt with severe social anxiety. I moved to a new town and did not fit in whatsoever. Also, my mom was a heavy alcoholic while I was growing up, so that may have factored into it as well. I do not appear to be \"awkward\" by myself per say, but I am constantly anxious and self-aware around groups of people and in conversations. Increased heart rate, racing thoughts, sweating, and even tensing of the neck occur when I am extremely anxious in a social situation. Also, when I am speaking to someone and I am anxious, I cannot think of words to say and I am often out of breath, although I am a great speaker around family. \n\nThis past summer, I began receiving voluntary mental health treatment for the first time. At this time, I had just finished my first year of college and was struggling socially. I had not made any friends (literally, I couldn't name one) and practically avoided all social activities. After the year ended, I decided to take action because this could not continue. My first experience in mental health treatment was at a state university behavioral health center. I had no option but to go here because my insurance had just expired a month prior and I was in the process of changing insurers. I was assigned a registered nurse to administer medication, who I would see once every other week, and a therapist, who I would see once a week. During this program (I was in the program for ~1.5 months), I was diagnosed with social anxiety, which I knew I long had. I was prescribed the normal starting SA meds: low dose Zoloft, Gabapentin, and other useless (to me) meds. None of them were effective whatsoever. I'm not sure if university facilities prescribe anything like benzos or strong meds, as that increases their liabilities. The nurse didn't listen to any input and didn't even know my name. Predictably, this may be the nature of large, state-run mental health facilities, where caregivers treat countless patients. The therapy was not that bad, but I didn't really benefit from it. I essentially just learned what thinking patterns induce anxiety in social situations.\n\nThe only beneficial thing I received from this program was being suggested to be tested for ADHD. I had much difficulty concentrating and focusing, I was distracted by nearly everything, I had no organizational ability, and I had an issue with hyperactivity, specifically constant fidgeting. Lastly, I could not concentrate on one thing and this significantly affected my first year academics (got a 3.5+ GPA, but failed a class and retook it to repair my GPA). I managed to do well without studying for anything because I just couldn't sit down to open my books or do anything. After I started my second year this past September, I was tested at an ADHD/Mood Behavioral Center and was diagnosed with ADHD. I still didn't have insurance, so I had to pay for the 3 sessions I used. Since this is a SA subreddit, I won't bore you with most of the details. However, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed 3 medications: Concerta 20mg and two different dosages of Vyvanse, of which I no longer take. Also, the caregiver was also a registered nurse, not a psychiatrist.\n\nAfter these 3 very costly sessions, my insurance finally cleared and I discontinued my treatment at this ADHD center. I found a fantastic psychiatrist and had my first session about a month ago. She is so knowledgeable and caring, which makes my treatment much more smoother. Since the Vyvanse I was on (prescribed by ADHD center nurse) wasn't effective and didn't last very long, I was first prescribed Adderall IR 20mg twice a day (she thought 2x IRs may last longer than an ER, as Vyvanse didn't previously last long) and Prozac 20mg for my social anxiety by my new psychiatrist. Since she saw my previous meds for SA, she first prescribed Prozac because it was an \"oldie, but goodie\" and has helped many. I have yet been to a party and have not drunk a single drop of alcohol during my first year of college, so I am very responsible. The nurse at the previous ADHD center blatantly stated she would not prescribe Adderall as a treatment solution when evaluating my options, although I had not made any suggestion of that whatsoever. It was because I was in college and it is heavily abused, which is partially true. \n\nMy psychiatrist prescribed it on my first visit and evaluation, which bolstered my trust in her. Let me tell you, if I felt anything on Vyvanse, it was trumped by the effect of the Adderall. However, I still felt it wasn't effective to where I wanted it to be and it did not last very long (~4 hours per 20mg dose, which is typical). Also, the routine of taking it was too volatile. I'd take a pill in the morning, then crash hard, then take my second dose, come up, then come down again, and I would still have classes to attend. \n\nIn my great, second visit this past Tuesday, the 2x a day Adderall IR 20mg was substituted for 30mg Adderall XR. This was because although I wasn't having any side effects to the IR, the 2x IR was not lasting long, and I felt I could go up in dosage, since I was still having many issues. The XR has been working significantly better than the IR, with no side effects. Next, she thought it was best to increase the Prozac dosage from 20 to 40mg for SA, as some people need a higher dosage for the drug to be effective. Lastly, but most importantly, she thought it would be good to prescribe 0.5mg of Klonopin (Clonazepam), to be used as needed. I've never taken a benzodiazapine or any SA med of this capacity (I assume benzos are at the top of SA treatment). I am to take this to \"test the waters\" in a way and see how I react. Although the dosage is really low IMO and I can go up much more, this has been the biggest change yet in my life. I had classes the other day, and I felt like I was set free (sorry for the cliche). No constant self-awareness, nervousness, anxiety, etc. I literally felt the way I should feel. I was talking to people with significantly less anxiety, so that I could actually make witty and intelligent conversation without stumbling over my words and being nervous of what to say. I can certainly say this drug can be the biggest change in my life--ever. I've suffered for too long in isolation, bogged down by this terrible phobia. I know part of it needs to be addressed in therapy and self-improvement, but this drug can assist in ridding, or at least curbing my SA. Also, I have to mention that I had perfect--if not higher than usual--mental acuity. I know benzos have a connotation for being \"feel good\" drugs that get you high, but I was functioning as I usually do, just with less social anxiety. I felt like the Adderall XR and Clonazepam acted synergistically, as I was more attentive in class and did my Calc. III HW quicker than usual. Maybe this is due to the higher dose of Prozac also, which my psych also prescribed because it can reduce symptoms of ADHD, on top of combating SA. However, it's only been 2 days since I've been taking the increased dose, so I don't think it's had any effect, as it takes time to build in your system.\n\nI will call my great psychiatrist tomorrow (said I can call anytime, for anything) and ask what I can do in terms of the Klonopin. I will express all of my experiences and try to see if there is a long term solution, with daily or multiple day frequency and higher dosages. I have a follow-up in a month, but I really don't want to wait another month to address this. I'm sure she will agree and make some change. \n\nI want to know what is the typical dosage of Klonopin for SA (above 0.5mg, as that hasn't been overly effective), how many times a day it should be taken (duration--increases with higher dosage?), and how many days a week it should be taken.

Is it possible to take the drug indefinitely, or is there a point to discontinue the drug? I really hope this, or something similar, can act as a long-term solution. I'm going into finance, so I can't hold on to SA any longer.\n\nAll input is appreciated, and thank you for reading this colossus of a post.

Been diagnosed social phobic helped put me on a path to recovery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard telling people you have this phobia, because people without it just assume it&amp;#39;s the fear of people and situations.  It&amp;#39;s so much more than that.  People with social anxiety/phobia are almost always associated with a variety of personality disorders due to the adverse effects of growing up with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no exception.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels ass backwards sometimes.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate being lonely, but I&amp;#39;m afraid to talk to people.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I do talk to people, I appear disinterested because I&amp;#39;m not engaged in the conversation. Sure sometimes I may not be interested in a topic, but other times I don&amp;#39;t want to engage in a conversation because it doesn&amp;#39;t come out right; At least that&amp;#39;s what i tell myself.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think that I&amp;#39;ve made progress, but in a lot of ways I still haven&amp;#39;t.
