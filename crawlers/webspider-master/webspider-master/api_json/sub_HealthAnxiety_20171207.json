What if I can't go? What if I get sick? What if I don't get sick, but getting to the bottom of this takes time and I have to push back the move? \n\nI just emailed my doctor pretty much demanding to take this to the next step because I'm scared. Who knows, maybe it really is just B12 and in a couple weeks I'll feel normal, but I just have this feeling that something is up and no one is helping me fast enough.\n\nThanks for letting me vent. it's so hard to say these things out loud.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": "Venting", "id": "7h85z0", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I am so scared and I am so tired of being scared", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "green", "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7h85z0", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7h85z0/i_am_so_scared_and_i_am_so_tired_of_being_scared/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512310461.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7h85z0/i_am_so_scared_and_i_am_so_tired_of_being_scared/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "tatertotski", "created_utc": 1512281661.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I faced a long time with depression. this time goes and comes.

Of course, I focused on this symptom and started diagnosing myself (i am 100% a hypochondriac). So webMD tells me it could be a UTI, prostatitis, BPH, incontinence, the whole 9 yards.\nMoving on from that, I did have a major kidney stone attack in 2014 where I needed ureteroscopy to remove it. When I had the kidney stone attack for this stone, the pain was honestly not that bad and it was a 7mm stone I believe. Since then, my most recent CT scan maybe a year ago or a bit more told me I had 3 stones (two in left, one in right).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently not having any pain except sometimes ill get a strong dull ache in my abs, a little under my chest.

About 4 months ago I had a bladder infection with a lot of bleeding and blood clots in my urine, and when I say a lot of blood I mean I was literally just peeing blood. I was put on antibiotics and it went away, about a month later I started bleeding again, but this time there wasn\u2019t any pain when I would urinate, I went to the ER and they said I didn\u2019t have a bladder infection and that it was okay. Okay??? I\u2019m peeing blood I don\u2019t think that\u2019s okay. I decided to see a urologist who also said I shouldn\u2019t worry, they tested my kidney function and told me my kidneys are functioning fine. But ever since then I\u2019ve been having a lot of issues with my bladder. I pee ALL the time, more than 8 times a day, my flow seems a bit weak, sometimes my urine is cloudy, I know there\u2019s probably blood in my urine, I have a plain in my bladder sometimes, it feels like someone is pinching it, and my right side (kidney area) always has a slight pain. I\u2019m really worried about my kidneys, I feel like I may be having some urine retention (I could be wrong though) and it\u2019s affecting my kidneys. I\u2019m only 24 I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be having anything wrong with my kidneys but I don\u2019t know what the pain is, and I also can\u2019t afford to get tests done to find out. I feel like I\u2019m just doomed and over time my kidneys are going to fail. But I also feel like that\u2019s just my anxiety talking. I\u2019ve been told that IC (Interstitial Cystitis) could be a possibility but I don\u2019t know for sure.

About 4 months ago I had a bladder infection with a lot of bleeding and blood clots in my urine, and when I say a lot of blood I mean I was literally just peeing blood. I was put on antibiotics and it went away, about a month later I started bleeding again, but this time there wasn\u2019t any pain when I would urinate, I went to the ER and they said I didn\u2019t have a bladder infection and that it was okay. Okay??? I\u2019m peeing blood I don\u2019t think that\u2019s okay. I decided to see a urologist who also said I shouldn\u2019t worry, they tested my kidney function and told me my kidneys are functioning fine. But ever since then I\u2019ve been having a lot of issues with my bladder. I pee ALL the time, more than 8 times a day, my flow seems a bit weak, sometimes my urine is cloudy, I know there\u2019s probably blood in my urine, I have a plain in my bladder sometimes, it feels like someone is pinching it, and my right side (kidney area) always has a slight pain. I\u2019m really worried about my kidneys, I feel like I may be having some urine retention (I could be wrong though) and it\u2019s affecting my kidneys. I\u2019m only 24 I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be having anything wrong with my kidneys but I don\u2019t know what the pain is, and I also can\u2019t afford to get tests done to find out. I feel like I\u2019m just doomed and over time my kidneys are going to fail. But I also feel like that\u2019s just my anxiety talking. I\u2019ve been told that IC (Interstitial Cystitis) could be a possibility but I don\u2019t know for sure. I don\u2019t know what to think, I feel like I\u2019m at a total loss... anyone have any similar stories? I\u2019d like to hear!

I have an appointment with the councilor next week to talk about this, but is there anything I can do in the meantime to get my life back? \n\nThanks for the help.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7giiyj", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Health anxiety is ruining my life.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7giiyj", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7giiyj/health_anxiety_is_ruining_my_life/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1512033869.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7giiyj/health_anxiety_is_ruining_my_life/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Rand0m_Name", "created_utc": 1512005069.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a short episode of arrythmia a few weeks ago that caused some minor damage to my heart muscles.

And I have a little bit of ringing in the ears when everything is super silent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have a fear that its a brain tumor, and in the past 4 months every doctor telling me not to worry, its anxiety, its allergies, have been blind to the fact that I have a Brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s where I ask for your help, the rational side of me is saying this is TMJ. I have had a popping and clicking in my jaw for YEARS. It even became a bad habit where I would pop it all the time because it kinda felt good. Then it got painful, and it would happen unintentionally, I remember going over to a friends house for thanksgiving and his mom asked me how long I had popping jaw, I was shocked because that meant she was able to hear it from two chairs away from me. I haven&amp;#39;t been to the dentist in a while, but last time I went the dentist he did notice it and said next time I come in I should get it checked, that was about 2 years ago. I heard that TMJ can cause pressure or pain in the temple region due to popping of the jaw, and I can&amp;#39;t deny that sometimes I notice a correlation with me popping my jaw then having that pressure. Also the ringing in my ears gets REALLY higher and louder when I clench my jaw, or extent it forward. Also my neck is incredibly stiff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that was the rational side of me, heres the irrational side of me: My brain is being pushed against my skull, causing this pressure. It&amp;#39;s not my bad allergies or TMJ, and the reason why other symptoms haven&amp;#39;t come up or have and then gone away.... is because it is still in the early stages of forming. After all while my general doctor said i was fine, my ENT however did ENSIST on an MRI if the ringing continued. it has continued. It&amp;#39;s a tumor, and I&amp;#39;m gonna die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So uh, calm me down a bit please?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying I'm 22, and my general doctor has told me several times that he does not believe I have a tumor because I haven't had the extreme symptoms of such (like headaches, seizures, and passing out), and some symptoms I've had have actually gotten better, something he tells me wouldn't happen if it was a tumor.

In a moment of bravery, I went to see a gastrointestinal doctor. I went to her office in tears, sobbing my story and saying that it is too late to save me and my life is over. With the most amazing bedside manner in the world, she coaxed me to undergo a colonoscopy saying that because I am finally here, she can help me if I am strong enough.

The next week, I felt so full after every meal I ate. I couldn&amp;#39;t even move for like 30 mins after each meal, but felt fine the rest of the time.

I started having panic attacks, the same day I fought with my sibling, and stuff were going wrong in my life. I threw up. Then I had intense nausea for a full month, I had to cancel my MRI scan. I knew it was psychologically induced because it&amp;#39;d leave anytime I distracted myself. I also had dizziness, and couldn&amp;#39;t get out of my bed.

My husband thinks my high reading was from stress and anxiety because before then I was stressed and convinced I had a blood clot in my arm.\n\nHope you guys can help me feel better, already skipping thanksgiving because I'm too scared to eat now with the other symptoms that have been coming up.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7exbab", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Pre-diabetes/diabeties scare", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7exbab", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7exbab/prediabetesdiabeties_scare/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1511443040.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7exbab/prediabetesdiabeties_scare/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Angelic-Kitty", "created_utc": 1511414240.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So just when I thought I was fine, I&amp;#39;ve noticed for the past few weeks my face would flush around the same time at night, around 8pm or 9pm.

So I&amp;#39;m a 21 year old guy and for the past month and a half I noticed a change in my bowel habits, just smaller than usual and kind of thin. Then all the sudden blood on the toilet paper. Of course I googled...which I shouldn&amp;#39;t have, and now I&amp;#39;m constantly afraid I have colon or rectal cancer. I went to the doctor&amp;#39;s and had an exam and they said most likely a hemmoroid so she gave a foam to apply. That made it feel worse. I went back and now they&amp;#39;re saying fissure and gave me something new. I had some back pain in my lower back that I suffer from often. Doctors dunno, they think sciatica and that corolates to cancer.

And read those comment, it help me a lot. I laughed, but I saw myself in there, so I can calm myself. So that I will tell you my story, hope it can help you. Sorry for my bad English.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m immigrated to US in Febuary this year ( in legally way, of course ). I&amp;#39;m 25 years old male. In the US, you need to have Health Insurance ( now I bought it, but it will activate in Januany 1), because the price for doctors is not cheap ( in my country just 5$, and you will know what happened to you ). I heard about that, so inside me, one fear is developed. The fear that If I have some serious disease, I don&amp;#39;t have enough money to cure it, and my family will be broke, and I will die anyway. I think this is the origin of my Health Anxiety&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 months ago, I had sex with a girl. Maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;, because you have sex with stranger, so that&amp;#39;s might, my throat swelled. This is the first time that I felt I can&amp;#39;t breath. And I felt something stuck on my throat. I go online and check for symptomes and it&amp;#39;s similar with Throat Cancer. I was so worried. I talked to my dad. He said maybe your throat just swelled and I should use salt water. I didn&amp;#39;t listen to him. I convinced myself that I have a problem that is more serious. I looked in the mirror. I saw something red and I freaked out, so I went to the hospital the next day. The doctor checked and he said he didn&amp;#39;t see anything. My throat completely normal and I should use salt water. I felt calm after hearing that. The doctor is really generous. He said he won&amp;#39;t charged me any money, because I don&amp;#39;t have an insurance and I have nothing there. If he charged, at least 130 dollars. I thanked him a lot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go home. I used salt water a lot and wash my teeth 3 times a day + use Listerine to wash my mouth. But another thing happened. My mouth have some ulcers and white mucus that make me think I have the Mouth Cancer. I was so depressed, this is the hardest time of my life. I can&amp;#39;t go to work. I said that I want a vacation and I stayed at home one week. Someday I could not eat anything. Someday I thought so much until my head hurt. I felt stuck. I wanted to go to the doctor, but I can&amp;#39;t go to the same hospital like the last time, because I don&amp;#39;t want to meet that doctor ( who didn&amp;#39;t charge me ). And then I found out that I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; with the toothpaste so I changed another one. After   5 days, my ulcers was healed and I could take a relief. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything have not stop yet. My left groin felt hurt and immediately I thought that I have a Bone Cancer ( or because of staying in bed for a whole week ) . My neighbor died at 18 because she had that cancer. I sunk in anxiety and I found a clinic for poor people and they just take 30 dollars for checking up by doctor.

After 10 days, It didn&amp;#39;t hurt anymore&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suffered a lot of anxiety and depression. That&amp;#39;s why my right stomach and back was hurt. I came back to the clinic one month later. The doctor sign paper for me to take images and X ray and they showed nothing. She said I don&amp;#39;t need medicine, just relax and do exercise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I still suffer Health Anxiety because my right back still hurt ( maybe by the reason that I know ). I&amp;#39;m waiting until January ( when I have Health Insurance ) to come back and tell the doctor to check some places, upper and under my body. I will tell her that this is the last time, If I still feel like that, I will go to meet the therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is my story. It&amp;#39;s funny, but it&amp;#39;as sad.

I laughed, but I saw myself in there, so I can calm myself. So that I will tell you my story, hope it can help you. Sorry for my bad English.\n\nI'm immigrated to US in Febuary this year ( in legally way, of course ). I'm 25 years old male. In the US, you need to have Health Insurance ( now I bought it, but it will activate in Januany 1), because the price for doctors is not cheap ( in my country just 5$, and you will know what happened to you ). I heard about that, so inside me, one fear is developed. The fear that If I have some serious disease, I don't have enough money to cure it, and my family will be broke, and I will die anyway. I think this is the origin of my Health Anxiety\n\n3 months ago, I had sex with a girl. Maybe it wasn't \"clean\", because you have sex with stranger, so that's might, my throat swelled. This is the first time that I felt I can't breath. And I felt something stuck on my throat. I go online and check for symptomes and it's similar with Throat Cancer. I was so worried. I talked to my dad. He said maybe your throat just swelled and I should use salt water. I didn't listen to him. I convinced myself that I have a problem that is more serious. I looked in the mirror. I saw something red and I freaked out, so I went to the hospital the next day. The doctor checked and he said he didn't see anything. My throat completely normal and I should use salt water. I felt calm after hearing that. The doctor is really generous. He said he won't charged me any money, because I don't have an insurance and I have nothing there. If he charged, at least 130 dollars. I thanked him a lot. \n\nI go home. I used salt water a lot and wash my teeth 3 times a day + use Listerine to wash my mouth. But another thing happened. My mouth have some ulcers and white mucus that make me think I have the Mouth Cancer. I was so depressed, this is the hardest time of my life. I can't go to work. I said that I want a vacation and I stayed at home one week. Someday I could not eat anything. Someday I thought so much until my head hurt. I felt stuck. I wanted to go to the doctor, but I can't go to the same hospital like the last time, because I don't want to meet that doctor ( who didn't charge me ). And then I found out that I didn't \"match\" with the toothpaste so I changed another one. After   5 days, my ulcers was healed and I could take a relief. \n\nEverything have not stop yet. My left groin felt hurt and immediately I thought that I have a Bone Cancer ( or because of staying in bed for a whole week ) . My neighbor died at 18 because she had that cancer. I sunk in anxiety and I found a clinic for poor people and they just take 30 dollars for checking up by doctor. My left groin just ached for 6 days so she gave me some normal medicine and said I can come back if the pain will have not gone for 2 weeks. After 10 days, It didn't hurt anymore\n\nI suffered a lot of anxiety and depression. That's why my right stomach and back was hurt. I came back to the clinic one month later.

I just wanted to ask others who have faced any similar things if there was anything in particular that helped them with this fear?

I told my mom and she said she'd take me to the doctors tomorrow's I'm afraid to fall asleep now sad I have the urge to cry too. Has anyone else experienced this, if so what did you do? I don't know if these pains are caused by my constipation  because for the past few days I have been getting constant constipation. When I pooped 2 hours today before the symptoms came up, I had an awful stomach that lasted for 20 min and then went away.

The health issue in question is minor- most people actually encounter it once in their life. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; come with complications though if it goes unchecked or untreated.

Seeing words like cancer scared me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was put on Lexapro after telling my PCP my anxiety suddenly got worse around the same time. Tried it for two days. It caused me to have headaches and random pains on the left side of my head. I feared tumors or something wrong with my head bc they persisted for three weeks even after quitting Lexapro after two days, and of course the suddenly severe anxiety. My anxiety worsened so I was constantly seemingly short of breath, had chest pains, heart palpitations often. This stressed me out even more, causing me to have more symptoms. I refused to take my Lexapro again. I feared side effects too much. They switched me to Paxil. I still haven&amp;#39;t touched the bottle after a week. It felt like I had been dealing with the head pains and effects for a month... it had only been two weeks. Anxiety makes time seem funny. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went on &lt;a href=\"/r/CBD\"&gt;r/CBD&lt;/a&gt;. I was pretty desperate. I  hate taking new medications. As a hypochondriac, I fear the side effects. Even though many listed side effects have to be listed even if during trials the side effects had nothing to do with the medication itself. I had heard about the success of medical marijuana, and I live in a legal state, so I did my research. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I researched a ton about CBD, and found info suggesting it helps with anxiety. Lots of anecdotal evidence where it helped people. Lots of people saying it helped with their random pains, aches, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried it last night. Had anxiety ALL DAY yesterday, and three or four panic attacks. After taking about 8 drops of my tincture, my anxiety largely went away. I went from a 10 to a 3. And I mentioned I hate taking medications out of fear- I admit I did have anxiety after initially taking it. But my fears honestly went away after a couple hours. It was the most normal I had felt all day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took it before work and I hadn&amp;#39;t worked my entire shift in over two weeks. I actually made it through my day without a major attack. I redosed during work and my anxiety levels were at a 1-2, instead of the usual 5-10 it fluctuated at for the last four weeks or so. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I currently have concerns about some slight facial touch numbness I&amp;#39;ve had since last night. I&amp;#39;ve been mimicking an exercise my PCP did when I requested a neuro exam- that came out clear last week. Usually I would be wanting to run to the ER despite NO OTHER SYMPTOMS.

And for those of you concerned about a high or legality- CBD is perfectly legal in all states, has zero (or close to negligible by law) THC. If you are sensitive to even trace amounts of THC, isolate products may be better for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so relieved that for once, I finally feel normal, or pretty damn close to it, and thought you all should know another avenue if medication isn&amp;#39;t for you. I will be taking CBD, alongside GABA, L-Theanine, yoga, and therapy.

I\u2019ve been on medication for my severe anxiety since September and I\u2019ve been doing really well in terms of not having panic attacks or anxiety in general, but for the last month I was having severe pain on the right side of my face and upper jaw. I thought it was a sinus infection, since I\u2019m prone to those, but it was the worst I\u2019ve ever felt in my life, I was crying almost every night when I would feel it.

I had my bf look in my mouth to tell me what he saw, and yeah, the top right one was coming through and pointing out toward my cheek.

But a few minutes ago, I had the first anxiety attack I\u2019ve had in months because I was driving and moved my mouth or cheek or something in just such a way that it felt like I had a lose tooth, or like I had hit a sensitive spot or something. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I felt, but the dread set in immediately (my worst anxiety is probably about dental problems and visiting the dentist in general). I immediately felt so hot in my face, I thought I was overheating (on a nice, chilly overcast day). And it\u2019s like all the old panic and anxiety just came back to me so easily, I felt myself starting to freak out and have spiraling thoughts like driving to the hospital or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a child I hated having loose teeth, I hated the way they felt when they would move, and I could never pull them out, I would just wait for them to fall out on their own while being very careful to make sure they didn\u2019t move. I still hate the thought of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have quite a few gaps in my teeth, so I\u2019ve always just hoped that my wisdom teeth would have plenty of room to settle in, and maybe they\u2019d even straighten some things out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I\u2019m freaking out about my teeth, specifically that my wisdom tooth might have loosened some other teeth.

I had my bf look in my mouth to tell me what he saw, and yeah, the top right one was coming through and pointing out toward my cheek. Knowing what was happening made it a little easier to deal with until I saw my doctor, who told me to make a dentist appointment ASAP, so I did, but it\u2019s not until December. I\u2019ve actually been feeling good for the last few days and nights, no pain, the best I\u2019ve felt in over a month. But a few minutes ago, I had the first anxiety attack I\u2019ve had in months because I was driving and moved my mouth or cheek or something in just such a way that it felt like I had a lose tooth, or like I had hit a sensitive spot or something. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I felt, but the dread set in immediately (my worst anxiety is probably about dental problems and visiting the dentist in general). I immediately felt so hot in my face, I thought I was overheating (on a nice, chilly overcast day). And it\u2019s like all the old panic and anxiety just came back to me so easily, I felt myself starting to freak out and have spiraling thoughts like driving to the hospital or whatever. \n\nAs a child I hated having loose teeth, I hated the way they felt when they would move, and I could never pull them out, I would just wait for them to fall out on their own while being very careful to make sure they didn\u2019t move. I still hate the thought of it.\n\nI have quite a few gaps in my teeth, so I\u2019ve always just hoped that my wisdom teeth would have plenty of room to settle in, and maybe they\u2019d even straighten some things out. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m freaking out about my teeth, specifically that my wisdom tooth might have loosened some other teeth. What do I do? Am I okay? Should I try to get an earlier appointment with my dentist?

I had my tonsils removed a few months ago and that was very painful. I will soon be getting harsh dentil work done soon as well.

Lastly, I fainted at a wedding in August which was very scary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All starred issues were diagnosed by a doctor and the others I haven\u2019t bothered to ask them as I think I will sin start coming across as a hypochondriac to the doctor, which may be true, but I don\u2019t want the doctor thinking less of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My issue is that I feel like I will die of cancer any day!

For reference I am 19 year old female, 5\u201d6, 54kgs, and am a sporty type, vegetarian, take vitamins everyday, etc. \n\nI currently have or think I have: \n\n* *Chronic UTIs* * (treated with steroids and monthly antibiotics)\n* *Tinnitus* (no treatment, self help with YouTube tone videos)\n* *Asthma* *  (inhaler)\n* *Cerviogenic Headaches* (aspirin)\n* *Lactose Intolerant* (lactase pills) \n* *Endometriosis causing sciatic nerve and hip joint pain*  (no treatment - is due to birth control medication) \n* *Very bitter discharge*, (no reason or treatment found yet) \n* *Chronic Migraines* * (sumatriptan)\n* *High blood pressure &amp; heart rate* * (beta-blockers) \n* *Mitral Valve Prolapse* * (check every 3 years)\n* *Lumbar lordosis, vertebrae push on my spinal cord causing leg numbness* * (back brace and prescribed physiotherapy) \n* *Fibroadenoma* * (will be checked in several months for growth and then removed)\n* *Near sightedness* * (prescription glasses)\n* *Trichotillamania* (no treatment)\n* *Social anxiety and chronic blushing* * (beta-blockers and benzodiazepines (lorazepam))\n* *Health anxiety!*\n* I also see very weird colours in my vision, where I see many green dots/blotches, yellow streaks, and it\u2019s very disorienting! \n\nI recently had a fibroadenoma scare thinking I had breast cancer! I came very close to dying due to kidney failure on my 6th Birthday, luckily receiving life saving surgery in time and so I grew up around and in hospitals. I had my tonsils removed a few months ago and that was very painful. I will soon be getting harsh dentil work done soon as well. I need back brace to prevent sensation loss through my legs due to spinal compression. Lastly, I fainted at a wedding in August which was very scary. \n\nAll starred issues were diagnosed by a doctor and the others I haven\u2019t bothered to ask them as I think I will sin start coming across as a hypochondriac to the doctor, which may be true, but I don\u2019t want the doctor thinking less of me. \n\nMy issue is that I feel like I will die of cancer any day! Or am also panicking relentlessly about all the times I\u2019ve hit my head! (I am an equestrian and experience the occasional fall, and also live in a low roofed house and hence hit my head quite hard on the low ceilings rather often).

No. It must be deadly. So now im afraid ill have a spleen rupture at any moment and im afraid to go lift weights because i think itll make it burst. \nHealth anxiety is just lovely.

Like y&amp;#39;all, I have issues with health anxiety.  Been dealing with it for almost a decade now!  The good news is that it does get better with time, the trick is to find strategies that work for you.  Below are some of the strategies that work &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;, and some others that don&amp;#39;t seem to help so much.  YMMV but I thought it might be a good driver for discussion.  This is stuff I&amp;#39;ve picked up from all over, books, websites, counseling, self discovery, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff that works for me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut back on the caffeine and booze.&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine is a known driver for anxiety issues.  We have a lower threshold for caffeine than most people, and once we cross that threshold, our minds go into overdrive.  For us, that means obsessing over every bodily sensation until we&amp;#39;re convinced we have AIDS and Stage III Super Cancer.  Cut back on the coffee, tea, cokes, etc, or eliminate them completely.  The withdrawal symptoms are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Booze for me isn&amp;#39;t a direct driver of anxiety.  Instead, it screws with my sleep patterns, which leads me to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get your sleep patterns on point.&lt;/strong&gt;.  Consistent lack of quality sleep is for me one of the biggest drivers of anxiety.  I feel like a totally different person when I&amp;#39;m getting good, restful sleep vs when I&amp;#39;m not.  Getting into a good pattern isn&amp;#39;t easy, esp if you work shift work or other types of odd hours.  The best advice I can give is get yourself into a ritual.  If possible, don&amp;#39;t go to bed too late or too early.  Experiment with what time is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise!&lt;/strong&gt;  This advice is given a lot on this sub, and for good reason.  I&amp;#39;ve been into physical fitness for a large part of my life (former military).  Lifting weights and cardio help me burn off the day&amp;#39;s frustration and nervous energy, and also puts me into that near-meditative state where I&amp;#39;m concentrating on what I&amp;#39;m doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what&amp;#39;s happening when anxiety hits.&lt;/strong&gt;  Anxiety is nothing more than the fight-or-flight adrenal response your body triggers when confronted with a dangerous situation.  It&amp;#39;s just that for us, our bodies trigger the adrenal response when our subconscious mind &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; we have a serious health issue, even though we don&amp;#39;t.  Often, our conscious mind knows we&amp;#39;re fine and that our fear is irrational.  Regardless, almost every physical sensation you feel when your anxiety is high can be attributed to the adrenal response.  Dizziness, light headedness, churning stomach, pressure at your temples, shallow difficult breathing, twitching, tingling in fingers/toes/limbs, fluttering in chest, heart palpitations, skipped beats, on and on, are all secondary side effects of your body being put in fight-or-flight mode.  However, because you aren&amp;#39;t actually in a life or death situation, your mind notices these symptoms and believes there must be something wrong with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept what&amp;#39;s happening to you.&lt;/strong&gt;  Once you understand that the physical sensations that you feel are actually normal (for the adrenal response), you can begin to decouple those sensations from the fear they invoke in you.

Like y'all, I have issues with health anxiety.  Been dealing with it for almost a decade now!  The good news is that it does get better with time, the trick is to find strategies that work for you.  Below are some of the strategies that work *for me*, and some others that don't seem to help so much.  YMMV but I thought it might be a good driver for discussion.  This is stuff I've picked up from all over, books, websites, counseling, self discovery, etc.\n\nStuff that works for me:\n\n* **Cut back on the caffeine and booze.** Caffeine is a known driver for anxiety issues.  We have a lower threshold for caffeine than most people, and once we cross that threshold, our minds go into overdrive.  For us, that means obsessing over every bodily sensation until we're convinced we have AIDS and Stage III Super Cancer.  Cut back on the coffee, tea, cokes, etc, or eliminate them completely.  The withdrawal symptoms are worth it.\n\n Booze for me isn't a direct driver of anxiety.  Instead, it screws with my sleep patterns, which leads me to...\n\n* **Get your sleep patterns on point.**.  Consistent lack of quality sleep is for me one of the biggest drivers of anxiety.  I feel like a totally different person when I'm getting good, restful sleep vs when I'm not.  Getting into a good pattern isn't easy, esp if you work shift work or other types of odd hours.  The best advice I can give is get yourself into a ritual.  If possible, don't go to bed too late or too early.  Experiment with what time is best.\n\n* **Exercise!**  This advice is given a lot on this sub, and for good reason.  I've been into physical fitness for a large part of my life (former military).  Lifting weights and cardio help me burn off the day's frustration and nervous energy, and also puts me into that near-meditative state where I'm concentrating on what I'm doing.  \n\n* **Understand what's happening when anxiety hits.**  Anxiety is nothing more than the fight-or-flight adrenal response your body triggers when confronted with a dangerous situation.  It's just that for us, our bodies trigger the adrenal response when our subconscious mind *thinks* we have a serious health issue, even though we don't.  Often, our conscious mind knows we're fine and that our fear is irrational.  Regardless, almost every physical sensation you feel when your anxiety is high can be attributed to the adrenal response.  Dizziness, light headedness, churning stomach, pressure at your temples, shallow difficult breathing, twitching, tingling in fingers/toes/limbs, fluttering in chest, heart palpitations, skipped beats, on and on, are all secondary side effects of your body being put in fight-or-flight mode.  However, because you aren't actually in a life or death situation, your mind notices these symptoms and believes there must be something wrong with you.\n\n* **Accept what's happening to you.**  Once you understand that the physical sensations that you feel are actually normal (for the adrenal response), you can begin to decouple those sensations from the fear they invoke in you.  Don't try to fight those sensations.  Fighting them only validates to your subconscious mind that they are to be feared, which will continue triggering the adrenal response.  Instead, learn to accept them and ride them out.\n\n I know this is easier said than done.  Believe me, I've had some intense panic attacks.  I'm one of those cats you hear about who ended up in the ER after his first panic attack bc I literally thought I was dying.  I know how scary they can be.  However, I can tell you acceptance is the key to getting over them.  Think of it as you convincing your subconscious mind that everything is going to be OK, it has nothing to fear, these sensations are totally normal.\n\n* **Practice mindfulness.** We all know how the anxiety starts.  Maybe you've been fine for a few days, maybe even weeks, then suddenly you feel some strange sensation, one you've probably felt hundreds of times before, and soon you're drafting your final words to your loved ones.  That escalating spiral of panic started with one thing, a single intrusive thought that came unbidden and told you there was something wrong with you.  Mindfulness is the art of acknowledging those thoughts but not entertaining them.  Think of it like a balloon that floated into your view but instead of grabbing it and studying it, you just let it drift away.  Mindfulness takes practice, but it's very effective in fighting HA.\n\nThings I've not found so helpful:\n\n* **Counseling/therapy.**  This is a controversial opinion, but I've found counseling to be of limited value.  The first few sessions are always good, that's when the counselor/therapist is helping you with the obvious stuff, but eventually I always felt like I was just spinning my wheels.  I'm not saying it has no value at all, quite the opposite, but I don't look to it as something to \"fix\" my HA issues permanently.\n\n* **Looking for triggers.**  At some point in your research you'll likely come across advice to figure out what your triggers are and either avoid them or try to figure out why they're triggers and try to address those mental issues.  My experience has been that this is of very limited value.

I\u2019m on my phone or computer nearly all day every day, often looking at this subreddit... My vision hasn\u2019t been great, but I just went to the eye doctor for the first time in 6 years and got glasses for my nearsightedness. (I\u2019ve heard that brain tumor-related eye problems like blurriness affect near and far vision, usually only in one eye, and that glasses wouldn\u2019t help. Mine definitely do.) My eye doctor also dilated my eyes and said they were very healthy, and from what I\u2019ve heard, if there was something pressing on my optic nerve, she would have seen it. My memory isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s definitely not terrible. I think most of my memory-related issues can be attributed to my anxiety causing me to be forgetful and just hyper-aware of everything I forget. Also, the tip of my right index finger seems more sensitive than normal, but that comes and goes, and it seems to be getting better these past few days, and it definitely hasn\u2019t been getting worse. It\u2019s probably because of some sort of nerve issue in my arm/wrist, as I do have occasional soreness in that hand and wrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, no real symptoms that would indicate a brain tumor. No numbness, balance problems, nausea, seizures, dizziness (except once pretty briefly, but I think I was dehydrated and drank some water and I was fine soon after), or personality changes (although I question this, because what if my anxiety is being triggered by a tumor?) But these things don\u2019t make me feel much better, as I\u2019ve heard that brain tumors can often show up with no symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, a few months ago at the beginning of this journey, I would briefly ask myself if I might have a brain tumor, and I always dismissed the idea because I had no symptoms.

After several years of being a serious musician, about a year ago I developed nerve compression and tendinitis in my arms which gradually prevented me from playing my instrument and forced me to take medical leave from music school.

The symptoms gradually got better throughout the summer, and I regained most of these abilities, but around July I got hit with extreme tightness and tingling in my legs, presumably from running, which I had been doing a lot of to distract myself from my arm disability. That too seemed to be going away about a month later, but around early September both my arms and legs relapsed pretty hard, and since then they&amp;#39;ve been bothering me a lot on and off. Although both of these things seem to be repetitive stress injuries brought on by activity, I have no doubt that my anxiety is what&amp;#39;s perpetuating them.

A week or so ago the thought popped into my head that this tightness afflicting my arms and legs might spread into my jaw area and limit my talking the way my walking, typing, playing etc. has been limited or taken away in the past. After a couple of days of constant panic I was able to finally convince myself of how ridiculous that is, but a few days ago the nerve symptoms in my neck and arms, which had not been bothering me much since April (the tendinitis is a different story) came back really strong, and I can feel it all the way up to the right side of my jaw. Now I&amp;#39;m convinced that talking and moving my mouth is aggravating the soreness, and becoming paranoid that I won&amp;#39;t be able to use my speech recognition program and therefore won&amp;#39;t be able to return to school in the spring, which I think is something I really need for my mental health.

No pain. No headaches/toothaches/runny nose/sneezing/itchy or watery eyes to indicate allergies or a sinus infection. Occasional facial pressure, but constant phlegm just dripping down my throat. It is worse some days and other days I hardly notice it. Allergy meds don't do anything for it. I brought it up to an ENT once but he didn't seem to think anything was out of the ordinary. \n\nToday, I have sinus cancer. Because of one persistent symptom. I want to crawl in a hole and cry. You'd think after 2+ years of health anxiety, freaking out over the littlest things and then being told they're nothing I'd realize this is irrational. \n\nSorry, just needed a safe space to let it out since my husband doesn't get it.

Guess that doesn\u2019t rule it out.\n\nI have no more answers so I was hoping someone could chime in. It\u2019s affecting our relationship too. She\u2019s constantly sad and feeling like crap. Just want to figure this out so we can get back to...normal...\n\nIf anyone has any advice, I\u2019d appreciate it.

Also I began to feel my throat closing in, and I feel this tiny burning feeling within it. I got scared because I kept having shortness of breath while this happened. Everytime I cough I get pain within my chest. I also feel really light headed and feel like I&amp;#39;m about to pass out any minute. I even urinated my pants during this experience. I also immediately got diarrhea &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now it&amp;#39;s gotten a bit better, although I still have that stuck feeling in my chest, chest pain, constant coughing and lightheadedness .

For the past 9 months, I have feared about 14 different types of cancers based on vague symptoms or a result slightly outside of the norm on a blood test. I am 36 weeks pregnant, and recently I had a drop in hemoglobin, which is EXTREMELY common in pregnancy, but I of course attributed it to a slow bleed somewhere in my body. That being said, I have had two endoscopes to look at my esophagus and stomach and 2 scopes to look at my colon. For some reason, I still can&amp;#39;t believe that pregnancy caused this drop (even though my HG has remained stable around 115-120 the past two and a half months).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, like so many others, obviously fear that doctors have missed something. For example, I am back to worrying about stomach cancer and worry that two expert gastroenterologists (with 50+ years combined experience), missed a bleeding mass in my stomach, twice. I also had biopsies done of the stomach and esophagus because they were down there. They noted an extremely small spot of erosion in my esophagus from acid reflux, but I think they missed a large, ulceration. And also, I apparently believe that I had a unique type that has not significantly progressed over 8 months. It is interesting that us health anxiety worriers always think we are the unique cases.

Since August, I have had 5 different abdominal ultrasounds done, at 5 different hospitals. The beginning of August, the first ultrasound noted that I had some mild water retention in the kidney (also very common in pregnancy, due to the uterus). Every 4 ultrasounds I have had done since then have noted the exact same thing (without the hospitals knowing about the results of the other one). This is something very minor that was picked up in every ultrasound. I have not had one where this (its like a few mm larger than my other kidney) was not picked up. Meanwhile, I am worried that a GI doctor missed a large mass, twice. This shows that they do find things when they are not &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;.

I'm young and healthy, still can't shake the thought. I can hardly sleep and every day im googling symptoms, feeling my body. Today I got convinced I had some lumps on my scalp. Maybe I do. \n\nIn any case, as my doctor told me all signs point to a normal and healthy response to some sort of minor infection. Still can't stop worrying and can't shake the thought that I have cancer slowly killing me. I even started considering how I'm lucky because all things considered lymphoma isn't the worst cancer diagnosis to get. \n\nAny advice for how to trust my doctor? How to stop worrying? What's really keeping me at it is the fact that the lymph nodes are painless and pretty firm, along with the fatigue and cold symptoms.

I&amp;#39;ve had over 300 CT scans to screen for aneurysms, jumping hospitals when one says no.I&amp;#39;m afraid of medication, afraid of the side effects, won&amp;#39;t take anything except tylenol and proven &amp;#39;safe&amp;#39; things over the counter. I&amp;#39;ve been on meds since childhood though and none ever helped. Therapy also never helped. I don&amp;#39;t even have to look up symptoms anymore, I&amp;#39;ve memorized them all to where if someone tells me to stop googling, I can just tell them everything by memory. There&amp;#39;s no logic, my mind jumps straight from headache or chestpaind to &amp;quot;OMG I&amp;#39;M GOING TO DIE!!!! 911!!!! NOW!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... I&amp;#39;m at a loss for what to do anymore.

I can&amp;#39;t go much anywhere without a freak out, I can&amp;#39;t stay home without at least 3 hospital trips a week, I can barely sleep without jumping up, running out the door and screaming at neighbors over my head bleeding inside. I was arrested last month over &amp;#39;false 911 calls&amp;#39; even though I legit thought I was dying, and had the local newspaper pick it up and show that I was &amp;#39;crazy&amp;#39; without even mentioning anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a total wreck and the last thing I can think of is to talk to people like me.

After my body had something real and my mind saw that it was real and I lived through it, something in my mind snapped and I was fine for a year and a half. Then my grandmother died this past summer and it came back ten-fold.\n\nI've called 911 hundreds and hundreds of times (yay for medicaid?) and been to the hospital more times than 911 calls. I've had over 300 CT scans to screen for aneurysms, jumping hospitals when one says no.I'm afraid of medication, afraid of the side effects, won't take anything except tylenol and proven 'safe' things over the counter. I've been on meds since childhood though and none ever helped. Therapy also never helped. I don't even have to look up symptoms anymore, I've memorized them all to where if someone tells me to stop googling, I can just tell them everything by memory. There's no logic, my mind jumps straight from headache or chestpaind to \"OMG I'M GOING TO DIE!!!! 911!!!! NOW!\" \n\n... I'm at a loss for what to do anymore. I'm seeing yet another therapist and crowdfunding a Psyciatric Dog hoping that I won't waste 20k over what's helped so many others.\n\n...But honestly, it's affected my life to hell and back. I can't go much anywhere without a freak out, I can't stay home without at least 3 hospital trips a week, I can barely sleep without jumping up, running out the door and screaming at neighbors over my head bleeding inside. I was arrested last month over 'false 911 calls' even though I legit thought I was dying, and had the local newspaper pick it up and show that I was 'crazy' without even mentioning anxiety.\n\nI'm a total wreck and the last thing I can think of is to talk to people like me. I was a burden to my grandmother (why I moved away), the rest of my family, and now becoming even more burden on my roommate. I just... don't know really what to do anymore. The only real 'help' this stupid condition is, is that I'll never have to worry about depression to suicide because I'm too afraid of death for that!", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "74zvxi", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "27 Year Old with Hypochondria at Wits End", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 11, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_74zvxi", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/74zvxi/27_year_old_with_hypochondria_at_wits_end/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1507467519.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/74zvxi/27_year_old_with_hypochondria_at_wits_end/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "PinkHairedCoder", "created_utc": 1507438719.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone on here take Latuda?

The Xanax just took the edge off of the anxiety. I could barely eat. My blood tests came back all normal and I figured that would be the end of it. I&amp;#39;m okay! But, no, I still suffered for another week. Went back to the doctor and they tried to put me on Zoloft. Unfortunately, I responded poorly to it and it made me worse on top of a host of physical side effects. It took a long time for my body to recover from that. Almost like discontinuation syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s where the health anxiety started. I&amp;#39;ve lost about 15 lbs I didn&amp;#39;t need to lose. Worried obsessively about that. People keep telling me the weight will come back once I settle, but it&amp;#39;s been 3 months since this all started. I&amp;#39;ve been having stomach issues (doctor diagnosed it as IBS and GERD) and have an assortment of other symptoms linked to the anxiety. The stomach issues make it really difficult for my to eat properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been back and forth to the doctor and ER I can&amp;#39;t tell how many times. Have had a bunch of testing done. I&amp;#39;ve thought so many things were wrong with me, but nothing points to anything specific. I&amp;#39;m considering trying medicine again, but I&amp;#39;m afraid of having another poor reaction. I am in therapy and it does help. It really does, but I&amp;#39;m having more days recently where the anxiety is more difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have not been doing well waiting for medical stuff. A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with a UTI and was thoroughly convinced it had spread and was going to make me really sick. It didn&amp;#39;t, but it triggered my health anxiety worse. Now I have another UTI and I know they are common in women and all that, but I hate this. I never had a ton of stomach problems, I never get UTIs, I never have so much trouble coping. I keep thinking something must have changed or something must be wrong with me and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m still dealing with all this stuff. My therapist says I need to work on acceptance, this is how things are at the moment, and I have to deal with it accordingly. That I can&amp;#39;t choose what happens to me, but I can choose how to deal with it. I&amp;#39;m dealing with all these things poorly, but that&amp;#39;s not what I want. I think of all the people who are really sick and pushing through. I want to be like that. I don&amp;#39;t want all the possibilities to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel sick a lot, just generally ill, maybe some people here might know what I&amp;#39;m talking about.

They&amp;#39;re just more tests and appointments I have to wait for to see if there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with me. This sucks. Originally, I just thought I had to get through the effects of the medication and get my anxiety in check, but now I might actually have some sort of condition? I&amp;#39;ve had anxiety for most of my adult life. I worried about my health very rarely. My anxiety was mostly social in nature. This all seems so ridiculous to me.

Currently I am dealing with some rocky dizziness, unusual vision changes, heart issues, and a skin biopsy. So far I have had a cbc, metabolic panel, thyroid, multiple ecg&amp;#39;s, chest x-ray, and eye exam that have all come back normal. I am still waiting on the results of the skin biopsy that should come in this week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning I had a stress test with ecg and have been put on a 14 day event heart monitor. The reason for this stress test is that my heart rate suddenly started staying elevated for too long after I run and I&amp;#39;ve been a long distance runner for years. It usually stays 120-130 for a long period of time that depends on how long the run was. For example, half a mile it lasted ~45 mins and 2 miles it was an hour and a half. Everyone has been telling me that I&amp;#39;m young strong and healthy and that everything so far has looked normal so it is almost certainly anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this morning I took the test and it started off really well. It took a while to get my heart rate up to where they wanted it due to me being a runner. But then once again in the recovery it just would go back down. It stayed in the upper 130&amp;#39;s to lower 140&amp;#39;s for almost the whole time I was on the monitor at the end. The cardiologist also noted something about certain waves on the ecg being way too high, which I could see on the monitor. I don&amp;#39;t know what they are called but the tallest points on the ecg were going all the way to the top of the screen and she said something about a lower wave being uninterpretable. So they ended up ordering an ECHO ultrasound of my heart and she mentioned the possibility of &amp;quot;left-something hypertrophy&amp;quot; but I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly what it was. Being a dedicated runner, this is extremely disappointing to me because I fear that I may never be able to run again, or worse may have a chronic heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also mentioned that it may not have happened suddenly, of course assuming that it would be a condition, but may have happened over time. It makes me think of how I have always had a way slower recovery than the other runners at the end of a race, even if I was much faster than them. I usually spend forever hunched over trying to come back to rest, even as a 40-50 mile a week runner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is very distressing for me because I was expecting everything to just look perfect and it would just be anxiety and I could get right back to it. They even looked bored at the beginning, probably thinking I had no reason to be taking this test right now being in such good shape.

It was a very noticeable disparity between the two sides, which caused an immediate alarm to trigger. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I googled the symptoms and came back with a slew of causes, including MS and ALS, which freaked me out. I was led to forums, posts, and blogs from people suffering from ALS and MS, young people with ALS, young people with MS, and it has been the scariest research of my life. I scheduled an appointment with my PCP, who referred me to my neurologist, who clinically examined me and was convinced all I needed was some physical therapy since she thought I had injured myself weightlifting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my first neuro visit, I started noticing cramps, twitching, and weakness spread along my entire body, which naturally had me worried. I started a thread in a designated DIHALS forum where they promptly told me I had no symptoms of any kind of ALS they knew of and told me to log off for my mental health. In the span of a few weeks, things have gone from, &amp;quot;Oh I have ALS because my legs are getting weaker&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;Oh I might have bulbar onset ALS because I can&amp;#39;t seem to finish a yawn&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything got incredibly more terrifying and real when I had tested for a moderately elevated creatine kinase level (CK), which is also known as rhabdomyolysis. Common causes of this could range from strenuous exercise to motor neuron disorders like ALS to various kinds of inflammations.  I was admitted to an ER for about 9 hours while they pumped me full of IV fluid in order to get my levels down. They did not decrease by much, but they released me since the levels were trending down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scheduled an appointment to have an EMG done on my legs by an ALS specialist. I came in to see him and he noted that I had nothing to worry about on first glance. He gave me a brief explanation that ALS was almost incredibly unheard of from people like me (26 year old healthy male) and was sure I didn&amp;#39;t have it. I had the EMG performed on both my left and right leg and everything checked out -- no ALS detected. For a brief moment, I had a respite from all this anxiety, a burden lifted off my chest. For those of you who don&amp;#39;t know, ALS is a complete death sentence, one of the most devastating diseases out there. There is no cure, there is only hope that a treatment will be found SOME day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But almost immediately afterwards, more symptoms started to show up. I had no explanation for my rhabdomyolysis, and neither did the ALS specialist that saw me. Suddenly, bulbar onset ALS sprung to my head. One of the first symptoms of bulbar onset ALS is slurred speech, which is apparently mostly noticeable by other people. So now, in between the fatigue from the rhabdoymolysis and the anxiety from feeling like I&amp;#39;m dying, I&amp;#39;ve become hyper aware of the syllables I&amp;#39;m pronouncing and praying that I don&amp;#39;t suddenly start to slur my words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my anxiety I feel like I have isolated myself from my family and girlfriend, who I cannot seem to communicate with without feeling like I have to rant and ramble about my symptoms because I feel like every little thing is killing me.

This is the reason I&amp;#39;m even typing this up here instead of in that DIHALS forum. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past few hours, I&amp;#39;ve started noticing problems with my throat and am now terrified that this is the onset of bulbar ALS OR something even more sinister like esophagus cancer. I have been deeply sighing for the past week and cannot seem to complete any yawns no matter how hard I push the air out. On top of this, I have lost approximately 7 pounds in the course of 3 weeks, which puts me right outside the range of acceptable weight loss for a 6-12 month period (I last weight in at 173 lbs). The neurologist has said point blank that something is wrong with me but he doesn&amp;#39;t know what, which is driving me crazy. How do people live like this? I actually hate this.

Bit long so please bear with me.\nI am 21 y/o male university student and this is my story.\nI am currently going through a particularly rough patch and trying to make sense of my symptoms. I believe that I do have anxiety but these persistent symptoms that I have been having constantly for 6 months make me think there is something else going on.\nI have been experiencing symptoms such as:\nCardiac symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations), brain fog, fatigue, bloated feeling, head aches etc.\nThe most persistent seem to be the cardiac symptoms but as well as that I just have this feeling of being &amp;#39;off&amp;#39; all the time, never ever normal. Every. Single. Day.\nNow for the backstory. I believe my anxiety is a form of PTSD because there are two incidents which have resulted in my current state of health anxiety. So here I go.\nJune 2015. I am 19, finished my first year of uni and living it up on my first lads holiday abroad in Corfu, Greece. Long story short, I end up being spiked and find myself in hospital with a collapsed lung and broken wrist and robbed of my watch and money on the first night. Great fun altogether. I still do this day have no recollection of what happened but according to doctors I took a bad fall. Basically this was my first real health scare ever and I took it quite bad. But as I got back to college, I aimed to put it behind me and get on with my life which I did. Up until the next chapter of my life.....\nDecember 2016. I am coming to the end of my amazing study abroad experience in Vienna, Austria. I am now aged 20 and a bit dumb with alcohol. So basically I went on a bit of a two-day drinking bender and found myself in hospital again with an irregular heartbeat and I have to get cardioverted. Doctors told me it was alcohol-induced atrial fibrillation or &amp;#39;holiday heart syndrome&amp;#39; due to low potassium levels after I vomited. Told to stay off alcohol for a month and I should be fine. Now this is when my anxiety really kicked off!\nI had just two weeks to spend at home with my family over Christmas before I had to go spend 7 months of my work placement in France. This is when I began to experience my first panic attacks and it led to a paranoia about my heart. In the next 9 months I have gone under the following tests:\n7 EKGS, 4 chest x-rays, 2 holter monitors, 2 echos, 1 stress test, numerous blood work (CBC, BNP panel, ANA tests, diabetes, kidney, liver) and all have been clear although I&amp;#39;m still waiting on the diabetes,kidney and liver results but they will more than likely be clear also.\nMy mind is completely boggled. Lyme disease? Chronic fatigue? Some other rare disease that I may not have come across google yet :( I just don&amp;#39;t know anymore. I feel like my whole energy and vitality have been sucked out of me and that I&amp;#39;ve aged 20 years. I want to be able to exercise without feeling like an unfit old man, socialise with my friends and live my life to the fullest while I am still young. If the doctors claim I&amp;#39;m healthy then why the fuck do I feel so horrible every second of the day. I can barely sleep at all anymore and even if I do get the odd good night sleep, I still feel so fatigued. So scared it is something like Lyme or some other mystery illness that they can&amp;#39;t diagnose. \nI have tried seeing a counsellor and doing CBT as well as taking Sertraline (2 months in) but I honestly don&amp;#39;t believe it is anxiety. I&amp;#39;m not asking for a diagnosis. I don&amp;#39;t know why I posted this really. Maybe cause all my family, friends and doctors are sick of hearing it and keep telling me it&amp;#39;s anxiety. But no one knows my body better than me. \nIf I have to spend the rest of my life like this I would probably rather be dead than be suffering from an actual illness but being told I am crazy.\nThank you again for reading this.

Ah, probably bleeding gums. Next morning, same thing. 3-4 days in a row. Ok it\u2019s not funny anymore, googled my symptoms - lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that moment I felt like dying. Well not forget to mention that I\u2019m 21 yo male, smoked for 7years 15cigs a day so you can image my fear. In addition to that, I was far far away from home, like on another continent, for 3 months already (working 70hrs a week). So after all that coughing up blood in the mornings, it became the only thing which was on my mind 24/7 I couldn\u2019t barely do anything, no appetite just a big desire to go to my apartment and lay in bed and sleep. I was so scared that I quit my job for which I came to the US to get some extra money. just for buying a new car or travel a little bit. (i\u2019m from very poor eastern european country so in the US i could get for one week the same amount of money which I would have get for 2 months in my home country. ) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the story. I quit my job without a notice because was scared to die  at a place where nobody really cares about me and without seeing my family and etc. So next day I\u2019m buying a plane ticket for 400$ and flying for 10hrs straight. Coming back home and my parents don\u2019t believe in what they see. It\u2019s me, your son. Them : but you supposed to be in the US? Wtf?? What happened??? So I tell them the story, about coughing up blood. I didn\u2019t want to tell them anything before I came back home so they wouldn\u2019t worry for no reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went to the doctor after few days, got a blood test and an XRAY. Was very scary while I was waiting for an xray results. Everything came up fine and my GP told me that it probably GERD or just blood from my stomach. Ok, she knows better. Prescribed me some stuff to drink for two weeks. (Forgot to mention, I quit smoking after that blood thing.) So a few weeks passes, September 12 or smth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel stupid that I\u2019ve spent crazy amount of money and quit my job in the US just to get to my GP and she tells me that I am fine. (I couldn\u2019t go to the hospital in the US due to the prices, it\u2019s sooo expensive.) Ok, so here is the thing I felt a little bit less worried about blood because coughing is gone (probably bcuz j stopped smoking) but blood is still here, every morning. So I spend hours and hours googling from forst day until today and of course it shows me cancer cancer cancer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to that I get weird muscle cramps, some spots in my back feel funny. (Near kidneys) Guess what, I am googling about that weird feeling and It tells me that I may have kidney cancer. I am having another visit to my GP on Wednesday to do bunch of tests to check my health. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chances to get those diseases is very small because of my age but I feed my brain by redditing and googling extra rare cases of young people dying from those things. (Don\u2019t ask me why...) so I am so confused about everything, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anxiety and if it increases all these weird feelings happening with my body. Or it\u2019s because I quit smoking and getting side effects. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story is that health anxiety can cause soooooo much trouble and the sooner you will find the root - the better. Everybody\u2019s situation is different but it\u2019s definitely playing with your mind so much.

It feels like I haven&amp;#39;t slept in days, but I&amp;#39;ve been getting enough sleep!\nSome conditions I&amp;#39;ve been worrying about:\nDiabetes\nFibromyalgia\nChronic fatigue syndrome\nBlood clot (DVT)\nMultiple sclerosis\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\nAs well as a bunch of other things. I think it&amp;#39;s unlikely that anxiety alone can cause such severe symptoms.\nToday (Sunday), I am feeling like absolute crap. Extreme fatigue and weak legs were my main complaint, and I didn&amp;#39;t feel like doing anything but sleeping all day. But I went out today and I felt like I could faint at any second. My vision was blurry, I was tired to the point where I could just collapse and felt very out of it, and I&amp;#39;m nauseous and having these hot flashes.

Last night, I seemed to be doing a little better, only to hit rock bottom once again.\nMy biggest fear is doctors not being able to diagnose me because my symptoms are too hard to explain, and dying in my sleep because I am deathly ill with a mysterious ailment. I also fear that I&amp;#39;ll be in the ICU on my deathbed, clinging to life. Another fear is that I&amp;#39;ll just be a medical mystery and deal with these debilitating symptoms for years to come, or maybe even the rest of my life.\nMy back is also bothering me. You know, I never had chronic back pain until the kidney infection came along in March of this year. So hey, maybe my kidneys are messed up too! The back pain is getting worse.\nYesterday I went to church. I was anxious already, but I really could not stop dwelling on how exhausted and fatigued I was, and I noticed that when I was going up stairs, it was more of an effort than usual.\nWhat I noticed next was this intense urge to rush to the emergency room. My mind was just going a mile a minute with devastating possibilities. I kept telling myself &amp;quot;yep! You&amp;#39;re definitely dying. You&amp;#39;re NOT gonna be okay, and if you wait this one out and wait even a few days to see a doctor, you&amp;#39;ll be gone by then. You&amp;#39;re gonna die. You&amp;#39;re gonna die. You are dying. Go to the hospital. We need to go to the hospital. We need to go to the emergency room right now!!!!!!!&amp;quot;\nWith that came even more irritability and anger. I had this overwhelming urge to run. I felt so weird. Everything felt like it was just closing in on me. I felt like I was gonna throw up. But at the same time I felt like I was gonna faint. And by the time I received communion, my mouth was so dry. I couldn&amp;#39;t produce saliva naturally so I had to really try to get the saliva. By the way, you can&amp;#39;t chew the communion wafer, you&amp;#39;re supposed to let it dissolve. It&amp;#39;s a respect thing since it&amp;#39;s the body of Christ. So if you&amp;#39;re wondering why I couldn&amp;#39;t just chew it, that&amp;#39;s why lol. This calmed me a little since my thought was &amp;quot;oh hey maybe I&amp;#39;ve just been neglectful when it comes to water this past week so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m having these symptoms.&amp;quot; But dehydration for a week? Really?\nI&amp;#39;m so sick of this. I hate living like this. There IS no cure. Health anxiety isn&amp;#39;t a joke. It&amp;#39;s a crippling condition, not a joke. And now I can&amp;#39;t get this fear of dying out of my head.\nI&amp;#39;m getting a flu shot next week. Can it wait? I&amp;#39;m so afraid of letting it go and suddenly I&amp;#39;m dead. This is exhausting and I&amp;#39;m so tired of it.\nI posted this on &lt;a href=\"/r/Anxiety\"&gt;r/Anxiety&lt;/a&gt; but haven&amp;#39;t gotten any responses yet. Can anyone relate?

I scheduled an appointment with s cardiac doctor in a month to rule our any cardiac problems. When I had my first severe panic attack in May, they did an EKG, and couldn&amp;#39;t find anything. I just want to rule it out to make myself feel better, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was taking ashwaghanda and it truly helped a lot, but then I felt good so I stopped taking them everyday, and regressed. I didn&amp;#39;t realize what an impact they had on me until today when I took one again and felt slightly better. I was horribly stressed out yesterday after being stuck in the car with my very BD BPD mother who was in an argumentative mood. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I have PTSD from my childhood with her. Because when she starts with me I shut down and start feeling panicked. Anyways, last night I kept waking up with anxiety right before I fell into a deep sleep. It must have happened 5-10 times through out the night. Now I&amp;#39;m afraid of sleep apnea. I felt like I was waking up and not breathing. I&amp;#39;m laying here afraid to sleep. Sleep use to had my escapee. Fuck. I hate. This. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to Florida to visit family tomorrow.

Sorry to be rude. But I WISH that was the extent of my problems. I'm sick and tired of laying in bed every night, unable to breath, feeling every sensation in my body, filing with fear about my health and obsessing over death. It's. Living. Fucking. Hell. \n\nLatley, I'm having a hard time convincing myself the symptoms I'm having are from panic disorder and anxiety. I scheduled an appointment with s cardiac doctor in a month to rule our any cardiac problems. When I had my first severe panic attack in May, they did an EKG, and couldn't find anything. I just want to rule it out to make myself feel better, I guess.\n\nI was taking ashwaghanda and it truly helped a lot, but then I felt good so I stopped taking them everyday, and regressed. I didn't realize what an impact they had on me until today when I took one again and felt slightly better. I was horribly stressed out yesterday after being stuck in the car with my very BD BPD mother who was in an argumentative mood. I'm pretty sure I have PTSD from my childhood with her. Because when she starts with me I shut down and start feeling panicked. Anyways, last night I kept waking up with anxiety right before I fell into a deep sleep. It must have happened 5-10 times through out the night. Now I'm afraid of sleep apnea. I felt like I was waking up and not breathing. I'm laying here afraid to sleep. Sleep use to had my escapee. Fuck. I hate. This. \n\nI'm going to Florida to visit family tomorrow. Praying I don't die while I'm there... in fact, everyday I'm just glad to be here one more day.

I thought the pain would eventually go away, but it continued to get worse the more I thought about it. Of course I started Googling my symptoms and I came to the conclusion that I have blood clots. This drove me absolutely insane, I couldn&amp;#39;t leave my house, I could hardly eat, all I could think about is how I might have blood clots, and that I&amp;#39;m going to die from this, my life is going to be forever changed by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since then I&amp;#39;ve worried about having just about every illness/disease/cancer under the sun.

At this very moment I&amp;#39;ve been worried about 4 different things, having a heart attack, diabetes, blood clots, and varicose veins. My doctor has given me many tests to prove that I&amp;#39;m okay but I never believe her, because in my head I think &amp;quot;if there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with me, why do I have all these symptoms and pains?&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s a never ending rollercoaster ride of emotions, fear, and panic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the outside looking in, most people just see it as &amp;quot;oh he/she&amp;#39;s just paranoid&amp;quot; when really there is so much more to it.

The cycle goes a little something like this, symptom/pain --&amp;gt; research --&amp;gt; (irrational) conclusion --&amp;gt; panic/worry --&amp;gt; diagnosis by professional --&amp;gt; new symptom, and then the cycle continues. It&amp;#39;s really nothing but irrational thinking, and obsessing over the possibility that you could potentially have this life threatening condition. Even being someone who knows that most of my symptoms are anxiety related, I always think &amp;quot;well what if there really is something wrong with me this time?&amp;quot;. The symptoms seem so real, it&amp;#39;s hard for me to grasp the idea that anxiety can cause these very real physical pains and symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Health Anxiety isn&amp;#39;t talked about very much, and not very many people know about it. I feel like more people should be aware, because with Google being such an easy thing to access, many people develope Health Anxiety without even realizing it. The more I read about Health Anxiety the more I have come to understand that it&amp;#39;s just all in your head. You&amp;#39;re brain can cause just about ANY physical symptom.

It has taken me a long time to realize that. But still, I struggle with Health Anxiety, it&amp;#39;s one of the hardest things I&amp;#39;ve ever had to deal with. It has caused over $10,000 worth of debt from ER vists, countless panic attacks, constant heart palpitations (skipped beats) every single day, weight loss, and so many other things. Most of the time I&amp;#39;m not even able to leave my house.

Sure enough, there was a solid-looking mass on one of my ovaries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By consulting Dr. Google, I found out that complex cysts had a 5-15% chance of being ovarian cancer. I must have looked at those ultrasound images over 100 times, comparing them to ultrasound images online. I scoured cancer and health forums to see if it was possible for a female in her mid 20s to get ovarian cancer (it&amp;#39;s possible but really rare). I found the stories of those who were in their 20s and I remember thinking if it could happen to them, it could happen to me. Of course, people on those forums would talk about their anxieties about complex cysts but then would never say how they resolved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the dr for my follow up and he told me that I needed to get a follow up ultrasound to see if the cyst shrunk. He then proceeded to tell me about one of his patients who got ovarian cancer and died. So that made me worry even more. I had constant dull pain in my back and on the side of my pelvis where the cyst was so I was sure I had cancer or that the cyst grew. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worried the whole summer until my follow up ultrasound this morning. I went into the room shaking -- I thought that as a best case scenario, I would need to get surgery since apparently complex cysts don&amp;#39;t usually resolve themselves. Worst case, I&amp;#39;d need chemo + would need to have multiple surgeries. As a grad student, this scared me. I repeatedly kept thinking about how I would change my schedule or need to delay graduation to accommodate my health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out, my cyst resolved itself. For females out there -- complex cysts can resolve themselves, even if they look solid. Even though I was SO SURE I was going to need surgery, everything went so much better than I had expected. There is a downside though -- I feel like I wasted my summer worrying. I went on trips and couldn&amp;#39;t get this off of my mind.

We have had unprotected sex a handful of times over our three year relationship since I&amp;#39;m on birth control, but we usually use condoms as backup since I worry a lot about getting pregnant.

What&amp;#39;s making me anxious is that I&amp;#39;m convinced we somehow picked up HIV from oral sex, or a condom slipped somewhere in one of his past relationships, or I got HIV or another blood disease from a shady piercing I got a few years ago (this wasn&amp;#39;t one of my better moments of judgement). Even though I&amp;#39;ve read about a thousand websites today (which I know is bad) all saying that it&amp;#39;s extremely unlikely that any of this could have led to either one of us getting HIV, of course I found a few other stories that basically said &amp;quot;we got HIV out of nowhere!&amp;quot; and seemed to confirm all my anxious thoughts. It has consumed my entire day. That&amp;#39;s the most upsetting part of it, because said boyfriend and I just got back from a nice weekend away yesterday and I took today off from work too to have an extra day to relax. Instead I spent every moment from sun up to sun down googling symptoms of an illness I pretty positively don&amp;#39;t have instead of sitting outside and reading my Kindle like I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to pick up some Oraquick tests tomorrow morning since Planned Parenthood is only open while I&amp;#39;m at work and we&amp;#39;ll both test since it&amp;#39;s smart to anyway, but after I&amp;#39;m over being upset about HIV what will be next?

Recently, I have also been experiencing pain in my upper back and the only thing that really relieves the pain is my lowering my neck into what I think is a stooped posture, so as a result I am still under the impression that I have one of the atypical forms of Sporadic CJD and an extremely worried because although I accept the idea of death, I do not like the idea of rapidly progressive dementia suddenly sneaking up on me and becoming bed-ridden, I'd rather die while being aware, so I'm constantly on edge. \n\nIs there any remedy that anybody here can suggest. I am planning on going back to the doctor and I am going to be doing counselling come this Friday, but is there anything that I can take note of that would help confirm that my fear is nonsense. \n\nThanks in advance.

I&amp;#39;d have a strong one. It may or may not send me into a panic. Sometimes that might happen a few times a day. Once in a while I&amp;#39;d get a couple in a row but then that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to take in more potassium, like coconut water or bananas, and watch salt intake, as that seems to deplete potassium. This would seem to make a difference over a few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I got them more mild, however maybe one two or three in a minute! and then no problems for a few minutes and then again they start. Then I&amp;#39;ll go a half hour no problem... then hours no problem. Then again...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wore a holter monitor once many years ago. They didn&amp;#39;t happen when I was wearing it. I have had stress tests. Last one maybe two years ago. Again, I didn&amp;#39;t feel those during the test, so I&amp;#39;ve never heard a doctor say, oh that&amp;#39;s just harmless pvcs or pacs. So I always go back to worrying that this thing that I&amp;#39;ll drop dead from is kind of hiding from the doctors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes Ive had anxiety and panic disorder for many years. Kept kind of at bay with SSRIs, but flares up with health stuff. I also have xanax with me but I hardly ever take it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I get older, starting the fifty mark, I worry that more things are likely or inevitable. I have a sibling with similar palpitations over the years, maybe more so, but no anxiety issues. Sibling was able to have a doc notice them and say, oh it&amp;#39;s just harmless pvcs and harmless pacs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been told that I have a mitral valve prolapse, and I&amp;#39;ve heard people with MVP tend to feel palpitations. Then there was a time the doctors said it wasn&amp;#39;t even noticeable, so they wouldn&amp;#39;t even classify it as such, and I know it can change over time, good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m terrified to go back for another stress test, but I know it&amp;#39;s time. They like to do it once a year but forgot to tell me last time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How the heck do you people function when you get these things a few times in a row, or on and off for minutes at at time? My whole world stops. I have stuff I need to do but can&amp;#39;t seem to function. At times I wonder if I should head to the ER, but then I&amp;#39;m afraid to. (I used to run to the ER a lot when I was younger, but nowadays avoid that.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I want to hear oh yes, I get the exact same thing... and it&amp;#39;s never anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to know how you don&amp;#39;t lose your mind when they happen so frequently. And if they happen frequently and then not happen at all for hours, what the hell is going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate health anxiety because it never really goes away. I&amp;#39;ll think I&amp;#39;m fine but that&amp;#39;s because I feel healthy at that moment. As soon as I&amp;#39;m not well, the worry starts.

Once in a while I'd get a couple in a row but then that's it.\n\nI used to be able to take in more potassium, like coconut water or bananas, and watch salt intake, as that seems to deplete potassium. This would seem to make a difference over a few days.\n\n*Today I got them more mild, however maybe one two or three in a minute! and then no problems for a few minutes and then again they start. Then I'll go a half hour no problem... then hours no problem. Then again...*\n\nI wore a holter monitor once many years ago. They didn't happen when I was wearing it. I have had stress tests. Last one maybe two years ago. Again, I didn't feel those during the test, so I've never heard a doctor say, oh that's just harmless pvcs or pacs. So I always go back to worrying that this thing that I'll drop dead from is kind of hiding from the doctors. \n\nYes Ive had anxiety and panic disorder for many years. Kept kind of at bay with SSRIs, but flares up with health stuff. I also have xanax with me but I hardly ever take it.\n\nAs I get older, starting the fifty mark, I worry that more things are likely or inevitable. I have a sibling with similar palpitations over the years, maybe more so, but no anxiety issues. Sibling was able to have a doc notice them and say, oh it's just harmless pvcs and harmless pacs. \n\nI have been told that I have a mitral valve prolapse, and I've heard people with MVP tend to feel palpitations. Then there was a time the doctors said it wasn't even noticeable, so they wouldn't even classify it as such, and I know it can change over time, good and bad.\n\nI'm terrified to go back for another stress test, but I know it's time. They like to do it once a year but forgot to tell me last time.\n\n How the heck do you people function when you get these things a few times in a row, or on and off for minutes at at time? My whole world stops. I have stuff I need to do but can't seem to function. At times I wonder if I should head to the ER, but then I'm afraid to. (I used to run to the ER a lot when I was younger, but nowadays avoid that.)  \n\nI guess I want to hear oh yes, I get the exact same thing... and it's never anything.\n\nI want to know how you don't lose your mind when they happen so frequently. And if they happen frequently and then not happen at all for hours, what the hell is going on?\n\nI hate health anxiety because it never really goes away. I'll think I'm fine but that's because I feel healthy at that moment. As soon as I'm not well, the worry starts. The doom, the fear... the guilt... \n\nI just want to be normal.\n\nThanks for listening.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6trepn", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Palpitations - my turn today", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6trepn", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6trepn/palpitations_my_turn_today/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1502793330.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6trepn/palpitations_my_turn_today/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "ItsJustLittleOldMe", "created_utc": 1502764530.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so first off I have a really bad cold, and with classes starting in a few days I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get better.

This will probably be a long post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been having an issue all summer with anxiety, particularly health anxiety. I\u2019ve had various irrational fears and feelings come and go over the course of the last couple months. It started with me feeling a dizzy/lightheaded/off feeling in my head. It\u2019s not exactly dizzy like you get when you have an ear problem and the room spins, it\u2019s more like an off balance, floaty, shifty feeling in the head. This really scared me and made me hyperaware of sensations in my body and led to health anxiety.  Fairly soon after this started I did recognize it as health anxiety and sought help from my university counseling center. Over the last couple of weeks, I have felt much calmer and in control of my anxiety and the other \u201csymptoms\u201d have come and gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, this dizzy feeling has been the one thing to persist along with strange visual disturbances that have coincided with it. I don\u2019t like to look at certain patterns such as striped shirts, small repeating tiles on the floor, and just generally anything with small repetitive patterns. Even something like small rock patterns in the sidewalk are uncomfortable to look at. They have a vibrating look to them and certain ones are so bad they actually look like they are moving in a wavy motion, like a wall in my school\u2019s gym that actually looks like it has a wave going through it every time I walk by it. The other less severe ones usually look like they just have small subtle wavy movements in my peripheral vision along with the uncomfortable vibrating and shimmery look. It\u2019s hard to focus on it as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the emergency room once when the dizzy feeling was really bad and scared me, I got a CBC blood test and blood sugar taken and everything looked normal and they sent me home and said it was probably anxiety. I have also gotten my thyroid tested along with sitting and standing blood pressure at my school\u2019s clinic, which came back normal. I had an eye exam last week that was also normal and my glasses prescription has not changed in the last 3-4 years. Those and an unrelated chest x-ray are the only tests I have done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up buying the student health insurance through my school and went to my first primary care appointment a couple days ago hoping that they could help me.

This will probably be a long post.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019ve been having an issue all summer with anxiety, particularly health anxiety. I\u2019ve had various irrational fears and feelings come and go over the course of the last couple months. It started with me feeling a dizzy/lightheaded/off feeling in my head. It\u2019s not exactly dizzy like you get when you have an ear problem and the room spins, it\u2019s more like an off balance, floaty, shifty feeling in the head. This really scared me and made me hyperaware of sensations in my body and led to health anxiety.  Fairly soon after this started I did recognize it as health anxiety and sought help from my university counseling center. Over the last couple of weeks, I have felt much calmer and in control of my anxiety and the other \u201csymptoms\u201d have come and gone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, this dizzy feeling has been the one thing to persist along with strange visual disturbances that have coincided with it. I don\u2019t like to look at certain patterns such as striped shirts, small repeating tiles on the floor, and just generally anything with small repetitive patterns. Even something like small rock patterns in the sidewalk are uncomfortable to look at. They have a vibrating look to them and certain ones are so bad they actually look like they are moving in a wavy motion, like a wall in my school\u2019s gym that actually looks like it has a wave going through it every time I walk by it. The other less severe ones usually look like they just have small subtle wavy movements in my peripheral vision along with the uncomfortable vibrating and shimmery look. It\u2019s hard to focus on it as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI went to the emergency room once when the dizzy feeling was really bad and scared me, I got a CBC blood test and blood sugar taken and everything looked normal and they sent me home and said it was probably anxiety. I have also gotten my thyroid tested along with sitting and standing blood pressure at my school\u2019s clinic, which came back normal. I had an eye exam last week that was also normal and my glasses prescription has not changed in the last 3-4 years. Those and an unrelated chest x-ray are the only tests I have done.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI ended up buying the student health insurance through my school and went to my first primary care appointment a couple days ago hoping that they could help me. They did the normal stuff at first: checked my blood pressure, oxygen, and checked my vision with glasses, said I had 20/10 vision with 20/13 in each eye.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen when I met with the actual nurse/doctor I was scheduled with, she listened to my heart and listened to me breathe with her stethoscope and went straight to prescribing me Sertraline. She barely looked at me and tried to say that my symptoms were caused by anxiety. She wouldn\u2019t even entertain the possibility that it could be anything BUT anxiety. Our meeting that I had waited weeks for couldn\u2019t have lasted more than 8-10 minutes after I even went through the lengths of buying insurance I can\u2019t even afford.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis feeling has not been correlated very well with anxiety as it has been near 24/7 for several weeks now, no matter how relaxed I have been. Even through days of me not feeling anxious, I don\u2019t feel any better. I\u2019m not entirely convinced it\u2019s all anxiety, but the doctors don\u2019t want to run any tests to rule anything out other than what they have already done.

Which one is it? Why isn't there an agreement on the answer? Why can't I just trust my doctor and start touching things with my finger? Why do I feel so hopeless and as if this will never end? \n\nI'm still stressing but that's probably because I can't engage in many of my self-care activities because of this stupid infection. I can't play guitar, video games, or touch my cats without fear of getting reinfected or infecting the kitties. Ringworm, while not life-threatening, has been the worse infection I've ever had.

I have dealt with acid re-flux most of my life so I am used to ignoring chest pains since I have always had them. I told the doctor about the stomach pain so they decided to order an abdominal ultrasound - nothing of significance except &amp;lt;4mm polyps in the gallbladder which isn&amp;#39;t anything to worry about yet and worst of all my pancreas was completely blocked by stomach gas(for anyway that has health anxiety and gets the opportunity to get a look at the pancreas its a blessing so to have this be unseen it frustrated me.) After the abdominal scan I was referred to a Gastro for an endoscope to make sure an ulcer wasn&amp;#39;t the issue causing the pain when eating. Endoscope came back completely normal except for a mild Hiatal Hernia.  So here we are today - I have abdominal pain (upper mid, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right, left and right chest as well.)

I&amp;#39;d been experiencing pain in my lower back/right leg and tingling in pretty much my entire lower body (both sides) when sitting. My furious, unhealthy WebMD&amp;#39;ing led me to believe that if those symptoms combined with bowel or bladder incontinence, I was at risk for Cauda Equina Syndrome, a spinal injury which can reaaaally mess you up and requires emergency surgery.\n So of course, after all these symptoms conveniently piled on over the course of the past two weeks, at work yesterday I let out a little number 2 while doing number 1 (I&amp;#39;d been freaking out about losing bowel control for a while), and decided that was it, time to go to the hospital.\nThey put me in the trauma center, ordered all kinds of tests, including an MRI, which thankfully showed no signs of disc problems in my lower back. A team of neurologists also came and checked all my sensations and determined that I was totally healthy.

I'd been experiencing pain in my lower back/right leg and tingling in pretty much my entire lower body (both sides) when sitting. My furious, unhealthy WebMD'ing led me to believe that if those symptoms combined with bowel or bladder incontinence, I was at risk for Cauda Equina Syndrome, a spinal injury which can reaaaally mess you up and requires emergency surgery.\n So of course, after all these symptoms conveniently piled on over the course of the past two weeks, at work yesterday I let out a little number 2 while doing number 1 (I'd been freaking out about losing bowel control for a while), and decided that was it, time to go to the hospital.\nThey put me in the trauma center, ordered all kinds of tests, including an MRI, which thankfully showed no signs of disc problems in my lower back. A team of neurologists also came and checked all my sensations and determined that I was totally healthy. With all that, and the relatively mild nature of the incontinence I experienced, I figured that and the tingling must have been all in my head (the right leg pain is real, but it's not a big deal if it's just on one side).

In the meantime I have been to A&amp;E numerous times with ECGs, x-rays and blood being done but they all write it off to being anxious. I had a 48 hour holter monitor back in December after my incident which showed nothing and an echo which showed nothing but mild thickening of my septal which has me worried to fuck! But my GP and cardiologist weren't concerned at all yet I can't stop worrying :( I am getting my thyroid tested in a week or two but in the meantime if any of you kind people have some words of reassurance or advice I would greatly appreciate it because I cannot cope anymore with this crippling daily anxiety.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6r533v", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Verge of a nervous breakdown", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6r533v", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6r533v/verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1501717877.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6r533v/verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Ejordan22", "created_utc": 1501689077.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a huge anxiety and depression problem i worry about things i probably shouldn&amp;#39;t and i haven&amp;#39;t noticed anyone i personally know no one that worries about anything similar to the things i worry about.

Today is the first day I\u2019m reminding myself not to touch anything near my jaw and I\u2019ve hardly had any pain at all today. As far as the \u201cswelling,\u201d well, according to my pictures, it\u2019s been going on for at least 3+ years and I\u2019ve hardly recognized it. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how anxiety can affect you. I\u2019m a mental health professional of 7 years and I teach people coping skills all the time but anxiety can be pretty debilitating even when you know what to do.\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6qto0c", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Heightened Health Anxiety", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 0, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6qto0c", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6qto0c/heightened_health_anxiety/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1501587168.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6qto0c/heightened_health_anxiety/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "FatChocobro", "created_utc": 1501558368.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this normal?

Funnily enough, I was about 10-12 years old.  I would get short of breath, or my back behind my chest would hurt (which can often be perceived as being in the chest cavity), and I would think it was because, at age 11, I was having a heart attack.  However, this was my &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; anxiety, which would only come for a day or night at a time, and it was easily dismissed as being nothing (due to my age and lack of other symptoms of heart attacks) and I could go on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second bout of anxiety had to do with skin cancer, after I found a benign skin tag on the back of my neck in my hair.  I first felt it when I was 14 years old, and worried intensely about it until my junior year of high school.  These bouts were worse, and would last upwards of 3 or 4 days before disappearing for about 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My third bout of anxiety at age 18 was the worst yet, and was my first really intense bout of &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; health anxiety.  It had to do with colon cancer when I found blood (from hemorrhoids) on my toilet paper.  I had an entire colonoscopy just to confirm that it was only hemorrhoids.  I couldn&amp;#39;t stop thinking about it for a few months, but I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; successfully reassured when the doctor confirmed a negative result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then my fourth bout happened at age 21, and everything went completely insane beyond any reason.  This is the type of months and months long anxiety that people often describe on this sub; wherein you switch from one ailment to another based on the most cursory evidence.  I was dizzy one day (probably from lack of sleep and extreme stress from my college semester) and feared brain cancer.  Then, I discovered my muscles twitched while I was lying in bed.  I looked up dizziness and muscle twitching and found ALS.  I was certain I had it, which compounded both symtpoms, making me more assured I had it.  When I came home for Christmas, my family could not console me.  This is the first time I could not be reassured by my family members during an anxiety bout.  My brain &lt;em&gt;evolved&lt;/em&gt; to rationalize away their reassurances, because they weren&amp;#39;t doctors and could not possibly perform the requisite tests for diagnosing ALS.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the next semester, I became preoccupied with a litany of ailments after finally getting over ALS.  I thought I had liver cancer because my skin was itchy on a very dry winter morning.  Fears over lung cancer after a bout with a chest cough that lasted a month prompted a doctor visit.  When my lungs were cleared, I figured it must instead be cancerous lymph nodes exerting pressure on my lungs.  So now my mind had evolved &lt;em&gt;distrust of doctors themselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had several bouts of anxiety similar to this, but now I am starting to notice increasingly elaborate mental constructions, almost as if my brain keeps evolving to maintain the anxiety and torture me.  I will get something I rationalize to be a cancer, and then bring back a &lt;em&gt;previous&lt;/em&gt; anxiety about a different type of cancer, and figure that the previous cancer scare from three years ago must have been real and metastasized into the current cancer scare.  It seems like my mind finds increasingly obscure and unheard of symptoms to blow up into a big anxiety circus.  It&amp;#39;s almost as if, within my mind, there is a section that says &amp;quot;Whatever Happens, Be Scared&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s like e, or pi, or Planck&amp;#39;s constant.  The only persistent property of my mind sometimes seems to be &amp;quot;I am anxious&amp;quot;.  My opinions, dispositions, ideological viewpoints, sense of humor, all change and evolve, but anxiety is always there and the mind becomes increasingly neurotic and ridiculous in order to maintain the anxiety itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've had health anxiety since I was a kid.

My brain *evolved* to rationalize away their reassurances, because they weren't doctors and could not possibly perform the requisite tests for diagnosing ALS.  \n\nDuring the next semester, I became preoccupied with a litany of ailments after finally getting over ALS.  I thought I had liver cancer because my skin was itchy on a very dry winter morning.  Fears over lung cancer after a bout with a chest cough that lasted a month prompted a doctor visit.  When my lungs were cleared, I figured it must instead be cancerous lymph nodes exerting pressure on my lungs.  So now my mind had evolved *distrust of doctors themselves*.\n\nI had several bouts of anxiety similar to this, but now I am starting to notice increasingly elaborate mental constructions, almost as if my brain keeps evolving to maintain the anxiety and torture me.  I will get something I rationalize to be a cancer, and then bring back a *previous* anxiety about a different type of cancer, and figure that the previous cancer scare from three years ago must have been real and metastasized into the current cancer scare.  It seems like my mind finds increasingly obscure and unheard of symptoms to blow up into a big anxiety circus.  It's almost as if, within my mind, there is a section that says \"Whatever Happens, Be Scared\".  It's like e, or pi, or Planck's constant.  The only persistent property of my mind sometimes seems to be \"I am anxious\".  My opinions, dispositions, ideological viewpoints, sense of humor, all change and evolve, but anxiety is always there and the mind becomes increasingly neurotic and ridiculous in order to maintain the anxiety itself.\n\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6qmtxv", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Does it seem like your brain just keeps evolving to maintain increasingly ridiculous health anxiety no matter what?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6qmtxv", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6qmtxv/does_it_seem_like_your_brain_just_keeps_evolving/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1501513905.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6qmtxv/does_it_seem_like_your_brain_just_keeps_evolving/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "throwaway461961392", "created_utc": 1501485105.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello im on 25mg of zoloft and yesterday forgot to take a dose but took it at 2pm and I woke up early this morning at 8-8:30 and took a pill.\nWill i be okay?

Tried eating diner in between, barely got anything down my throat. \n\n\nWhen I was done playing and decided to sleep, I felt the same \"acidity\" and sickness again, all thoughts that I wanted to go away came back and I threw up. Spit out a bit of blood in my spit afterwards, must have come from my throat. \n\n\nI've had a history of getting sick at parties or similar, but had kept my HA from eating me up by telling me it must be PC or similar. Now it's been going for 2 yrs (The stomach thing) and I feel like this might be it worsening and my HA fucks with my head again.\n\n\n\nThis is way too much for me to handle at once, I can't keep up with this shit. Any reaction by anyone on how I can deal with all of this would be helpful. Exams never consciously stressed me this much, but maybe it's creeping on me. I feel aweful. I do not feel comfortable talking to anyone about this. I'm considering seeing a therapist again, but I can not afford losing the time until my finals are done.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "confidence", "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6q6jif", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Worst few days ever, HA mixed with other shitty things", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 1, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vmoc", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6q6jif", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6q6jif/worst_few_days_ever_ha_mixed_with_other_shitty/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1501302709.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6q6jif/worst_few_days_ever_ha_mixed_with_other_shitty/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "throaway7317", "created_utc": 1501273909.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HealthAnxiety", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.HealthAnxiety", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "HealthAnxiety", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suffer from crippling illness anxiety, and lately I&amp;#39;ve found myself wondering WHY we&amp;#39;re all afraid to die (myself included).

I told him what happened when and how it felt and explained the story fully with all symptoms (In past visits I&amp;#39;ve always missed something, not this time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After running a basic physical on me and several methods which hadn&amp;#39;t been used on me before (stethoscope to the arm and neck as well as pressing on my back and chest while asking me if it hurt) he told me I have a &lt;em&gt;Marphanoid Body Habitus&lt;/em&gt;, which means my muscles and joints are extra elastic among other things. How this affects my heart is something along the lines of my heart valves being less rigid and prone to prolapse and my aorta being prone to degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said I also have a respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which causes my heart rate to rise when inhaling and lower when exhaling (which I actually observed and thought to be normal, which he said is normal in young men) and &amp;quot;a bit of a&amp;quot; heart click (fuck me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of this put together he said I am at risk for and may already have a Mitral Valve Prolapse which is apparently common for people with MBH and also may cause the aorta to enlarge.

It&amp;#39;s the best doctors visit yet, he put most of my fears at ease but also told me not to raise my heart rate super high for extended times (In his words, I best steer clear of sports for the time being) and is on the look for whether I actually have something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with this good news and hope has come my fear, once again.

And no one seems to really get it unless they have it too. I figure therapy will be really great, so I'm hoping to start that soon. But yeah.\n\nToday was a bit worse. Felt short of breath at moments after doing a very normal task. I might go to urgent care or just bite the bullet and go to the ER tomorrow to just get it all verified that I'm, for the last time, fine. But you know how it goes. Hypochondria somehow overcomes all moments of logic.\n\nIf anyone here also has this problem, don't hesitate to reach out.

I can barely concentrate on anything. I've been having some very weird, very uncomfortable, and occasionally very painful symptoms.\n\nEarlier this year I was having a problem with waking up at 4:30 AM with intense nausea and abdominal pain. I would also panic during these events, so I never knew if my anxiety was causing the stomach pains or the stomach pains were causing the anxiety. I'd immediately head to the bathroom and sit in there for 10-20 minutes. It really sucked. I felt very heavy and bloated and desperate to finally have a bowel movement because I felt as though there was this huge pressure in my abdomen. If I were a cartoon character I would have burst like a balloon. I almost called 911 a couple times. After my bowels finally got moving I would feel well enough to go back to bed and sleep soundly.\n\nWeirdly enough I stopped having these issues when one night I decided to sleep 'upside down' with my pillows and my head where my feet used to be. After a week or two of that I rotated my bed around and my sleep (when I finally get it) is fine.
