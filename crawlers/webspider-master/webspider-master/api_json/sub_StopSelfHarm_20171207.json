My crush is a 12 yr old girl, were both in 7th grade, and we sit next to each other in english class. I&amp;#39;m a fucking mess right now and feel like vomiting whenever I think about this too hard, let alone type this, so sorry if my grammar is the quality of a potato but I really need to reach out to some internet strangers for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#39;m not even going to disguise names like I usually do whenever talking about someone else on the internet. Her name is Ava and I&amp;#39;ve been crushing on her for about 9 months. However, this past Tuesday in english something was different. I noticed that she had bent a paper clip and was doing something to her hand. I thought she was doing that thing were you scratch yourself very hard with a fingernail and the skin turns white, but nope. It looked like a cat had just clawed the back of her hand. I&amp;#39;d also like to mention that I am quite a dumbass, which leads to some of my future actions in this thread. I just casually asked her &amp;quot;Why are you drawing on yourself&amp;quot; (I tried to think like I missed the paperclip and mistook it for a marker. Again I&amp;#39;m a dumbass but she draws cute designs on her arm with marker all the time, had to give it a shot right?) and she responds with &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not doing anything&amp;quot;. I told her I saw what I she was doing {Dumbass Alert} and she admits that she was &amp;quot;Hurting herself&amp;quot;, yes that&amp;#39;s actually what she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were fucking around on youtube instead of working on our essays, and our teacher is a bit oblivious to our section of the classroom, so I could chat. The conversation continues. In a reeeallly desperate voice she says &amp;quot;Please you can&amp;#39;t tell me mom&amp;quot;, I expressed to her I wasn&amp;#39;t going to, but that was semi-bullshit, I wanted to get her the help she needed, but not through her mom. &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t tell anyone. There are just some things that you cannot say!&amp;quot; She was begging and sounded quite desperate. I just told her that &amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t going to&amp;quot;, even though that wasn&amp;#39;t really true. However, I&amp;#39;m faced with a giant fucking dilema now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a crush on her, we&amp;#39;ve been friends since 6th grade, knew each other since 2nd grade, and I think she&amp;#39;s starting to like me. She&amp;#39;s begun to tease me this year about my long hair, my super hairly legs, and calls me a sasquatch sometimes. She also &amp;quot;roasts&amp;quot; me, but in all of these situations it&amp;#39;s clear to both of us that it&amp;#39;s a joke, even if I get pissed at her for a few over it. If I break the news to someone, our friendship will 100% come to an end, and I won&amp;#39;t get that sweet Taken tag that I&amp;#39;ve wanted since I was 11. I know its the bullshit at 13 &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been single all my life! WHAAAA!&amp;quot;, but I think there is something special here. I don&amp;#39;t entirely want to get her help because our friendship will end, which is something I REALLY don&amp;#39;t want and I don&amp;#39;t think she would entirely want either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I have 3 options. 1) I can call a number for help like this. I own my own, shitty flip phone so I can call a helpline. However, I doubt that they will take me 100% seriously when I say it&amp;#39;s my friend, not me, and I can&amp;#39;t provide her home address. I can tell them her name, what school she goes to, and her age and grade, and I&amp;#39;m nervous as fuck about doing this. What if my mom just walks in on me talking to a fucking helpline and goes apeshit (Very unlikely but still, I can do it home alone). What If they ask too many questions I can&amp;#39;t provide answers to, therefore not getting her help? I also still sounds very much like a kid, not a young man, think of a kid with a slightly deep voice but still a squeaker, I don&amp;#39;t know why this will interfere in a negative way but I have a hunch. I also don&amp;#39;t know exactly which number to call, it&amp;#39;s not the suicide helpline, since she is just self-harming herself with a paperclip. Both of us live in the United states, and in the state of Michigan if that&amp;#39;s relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Talk to the school counselor about it. She&amp;#39;s one of the friendliest women I know, I used to talk to her a lot, but not anymore. I&amp;#39;d also now like to mention for all 3 of these, that breaking the news in a clear way is going to be hard because of my minor case of social anxiety, so I will probably sound like a clusterfuck of jibberish. But, assuming that I can talk to people about it, she is a good choice. She will tell Ava&amp;#39;s mom, and Ava&amp;#39;s mom can help her get help. Again, if I tell anybody our friendship will end, Ava and I are the only people that know about her cutting. I could easily skip lunch to talk to the school counselor, so booking a time wouldn&amp;#39;t be too difficult. I may want to tell the counselor a month or two from now so that all parties involved have some time to diffuse, but I&amp;#39;m worried about it getting worse. I could ask the counselor to be anonymous (And she will comply to that, she loves me like a son), but that wouldn&amp;#39;t help because she would know it&amp;#39;s me because I&amp;#39;m the only other person that knows she cuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Help her myself/Do nothing. I don&amp;#39;t necessarily want to do nothing at all, because despite our friendship ending I still really want to help her. I&amp;#39;m 13, so crushes and friendships are very special at my age, I can&amp;#39;t just rip that away from myself, but I still really need to get her the help she needs. I could try and be as friendly and understanding as possible and not blow up in her face, and help her myself, but the chance of me actually stopping that behaviour without sounding creepy or loosing chemistry is going to be next to impossible. I&amp;#39;m not sure why I&amp;#39;m considering these as options, as both of the ideas are horrible, next to ruling these 2 out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some closing info: You can call me a selfish bastard for not helping her just because of my needs, but I&amp;#39;m not a charity. Also, if my hypotheses about her and I having chemistry is true, then it would hurt her too, even more than whatever was causing herself to cut in the first place. I&amp;#39;m 13 and live in the US (In the state of Michigan if that&amp;#39;s relevant), so what number do I call for help that isn&amp;#39;t a suicide line? Which option should I go for? I really want to get her help, but I don&amp;#39;t want to destroy our friendship and embarrass her to her family by her requiring help. I&amp;#39;m broken, I have to do something, but I&amp;#39;m not sure what, and the pressure I&amp;#39;m experiencing is unreal. I think I&amp;#39;m going to start crying now, I&amp;#39;m glad I got this off my chest, but I&amp;#39;m very sensitive about this girl, even around my family (They know I like her), and I need some help. Also tell me If I posted this in the wrong subreddit so I can repost this there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\nI've already posted this in a seperate subreddit but I felt like it was more appropriate here.\n\nAs the title says, I'm only a 13 yr old guy so this is a lot for me.

I&amp;#39;ve been coping with depression for a while now, but never really turned to self-harm until now. I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what exactly prompted me to do this. I was studying in my room, when suddenly a thought popped into my head - five minutes later I was back at my desk staring at the Swiss Army knife in my hand, trying to work up the courage to either put it back in the drawer or actually do it (cut).

Its what I imagine drug addicts feel, knowing your killing your brain but can&amp;#39;t stop because you feel good for a very short time. I actively fear if I don&amp;#39;t stop I&amp;#39;ll end up with a stroke, seizures or can&amp;#39;t control my moterfunctions, or even pissing myself.

That&amp;#39;s compulsive hair plucking if you were wondering, in my case it was my legs. They still look messed up. I&amp;#39;ll probably never wear a skirt or shorts again. I know that started when I was under massive stress, long story. I moved and made sure there was no tweasers in my APT. It drove me nuts, I ran the hottest possible water over my legs in the shower which felt....so fucking good. I did some other shit to my legs for a bit, but I ended it. But how can I get rid of my hands to stop the choking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My old therapist was happy I stopped the hair thing but warned me patients with similar issues pick up something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the new &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; she was talking about.

I grip the wheel and blast music, bite my lip and clench my teeth but its always in the back of my mind, screaming. Its worse then when I tried to quit smoking years ago.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its weird, I have no problem telling my therapist or family about my deepest, fucked up feelings, or even my one year bender, but I am so ashamed by my choking or my previous hair plucking.

It took me a year and a half of trying before I finally was able to stop. Today marks one full year free from self-harm. This is probably my first year without self-harming since my mid-teens (Over a decade ago).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this post to offer some inspiration for others trying to stop. It took lots of time and many attempts for me to make it to this point. I feel like I have, for the most part, broken the hold that self-harming had over me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the urge to self harm actually came back stronger than normal this week. It must be because it is the one year anniversary of me stopping. I am doing okay though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should mention a few things that helped me stop:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep track of how long it has been been since you last cut.\nEverytime I cut myself, I would force myself to write the date in a text document. Then, the next time I was feeling the urge to cut I could look at that date and count the number of days it had been since I last cut. This deterred me from cutting many times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destroy and throw away all razors, knifes, needles etc.\nNot having something nearby to harm with really helps as well. I can&amp;#39;t stress this enough. Even if I eventually found something to harm with, it still gives me some time to calm down and convince myself not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have something to do ready if the urge to cut suddenly strikes. I had a stress ball and would squeeze that while watching trending videos on youtube.

It took me a year and a half of trying before I finally was able to stop. Today marks one full year free from self-harm. This is probably my first year without self-harming since my mid-teens (Over a decade ago).\n\nI wanted to make this post to offer some inspiration for others trying to stop. It took lots of time and many attempts for me to make it to this point. I feel like I have, for the most part, broken the hold that self-harming had over me. \n\nHowever, the urge to self harm actually came back stronger than normal this week. It must be because it is the one year anniversary of me stopping. I am doing okay though.\n\nI feel like I should mention a few things that helped me stop:\n\n1. Keep track of how long it has been been since you last cut.\nEverytime I cut myself, I would force myself to write the date in a text document. Then, the next time I was feeling the urge to cut I could look at that date and count the number of days it had been since I last cut. This deterred me from cutting many times.\n\n2. Destroy and throw away all razors, knifes, needles etc.\nNot having something nearby to harm with really helps as well. I can't stress this enough. Even if I eventually found something to harm with, it still gives me some time to calm down and convince myself not to.\n \n3. Have something to do ready if the urge to cut suddenly strikes. I had a stress ball and would squeeze that while watching trending videos on youtube. I tried to distract myself for as long as possible, the urge to cut usual went down after a little bit of time. \n\n4. Only do things that are relaxing when you have the urge to cut. \nI tried to play multiplayer video games to distract myself when I had the urge to cut, but it often made things worse. I would start losing and it would make me feel even worse. Eventually, I realized this and instead I started watching youtube or netflix.\n\n5. Avoid websites that feature self harm or have depressing content. \nStumbling upon pictures of people harming themselves or being harmed by others caused me to harm myself many times. \n\n6. Google and read encouraging websites when you have the urge to self-harm. \nThere are a lot of good websites about self harm. I wish I could remember specific ones. Reading them helped me many times to avoid harming myself.\n\n7. Remember to take care of your basic needs. Sometimes when I was feeling terrible I did not realized how hungry or tired I was. Addressing these needs often made me feel a lot better.\n\n8. Distract yourself by masturbating. \nI am very ashamed of this because I am Catholic. But, masturbating helped me to stop the urges to cut myself. It stopped me from cutting countless times. \n\nThat is all I can think for now. I hope someone reads this it and it helps them the way many other posts have helped me.\n\nLastly I wanted to say thank you to the people on here that replied to my posts so long ago.

My husband recommended it to me because he\u2019s been reading the pages on opiate recovery, which I am proud to say he is almost 10 months clean after nearly 10 years of the struggle. I am so very proud :) Anyway, he pointed me in this direction to look for help with my own issues with self-harm, mental health, and alcohol/substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started cutting myself when I was like 15, I didn\u2019t know any other way to get out all the physical rage that I was feeling. Like chest crushing, can\u2019t breathe, wanna-smash-my-own-face-in-with-a-hammer-type rage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those feelings started after I was sexually assaulted by a friend. We had become really close very quickly, and he had a plethora of his own psychotic issues\u2026 I introduced him to my best friend and they started dating, and we were like a fun trio that was inseparable\u2026 One night he was staying at my house, and after a few drinks, he kept giving Klonopin pills and before I knew it he was on top of me. My body was almost limp, I had no power to fight him and I couldn\u2019t speak right\u2026 I had my period, so he didn\u2019t wanna put it there, so he forced me to suck his dick but since I was crying so much I guess it wasn\u2019t very good, so he fucked my tits instead and came all over me. Then he just went upstairs to the couch and fell asleep while I cried my eyes out the whole night, alone in my basement bedroom. The next morning I woke him up, brought him home, and went straight to my best friend\u2019s house to tell her what happened. I had bruises on both my arms from him holding me down. Deep down I still feel like I betrayed her like I cheated with her boyfriend... I should have known what was coming. I should have screamed for my parents, or bit his dick to make him stop\u2026.. I don\u2019t even know if you would call it rape, but it definitely feels like I was raped that night. But it still feels like my own fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I started hanging out with another bad group of guys, who also treated me badly and influenced my drug use even further. I had always smoked pot and drank, and had dabbled in benzos, but I started taking lots of molly- back when molly actually was MDMA and not fucking bath salts and shit\u2026 I nearly lost my mind for real a couple times on the come-down, fucking psychosis\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was around that time that I began cutting on a regular basis. Not to kill myself, just because it was the only thing that made me stop crying. I would have bad anxiety attacks, my brain would get stuck in really negative thought-loops and nothing would give my brain peace except some kind of physical pain. Instant relief, like a literal weight lifting off my chest and I could breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know drug use  exacerbates these issues, but I had these feelings as a little kid. I would scratch my arms up or bang my head into the wall sometimes out of frustration. I was actually a very happy child, even though I saw a lot of fighting and moved around a lot. My parents would fist fight, I woke up to my Dad being put into the back of a cop car in handcuffs one night. We lived with grandparents, friends, and even a few shelters for abused women and children. As crazy as that all sounds, those were the best years of my life. Growing up in the chaos was hard, but experiencing such a network of support was extremely comforting. I learned so much by going to AA meetings with my mom, too. She didn\u2019t have money to pay for a sitter and I was a very well behaved child so I would come with her several times a week and listen to the stories of these people who have experienced so much and learned from it and became better\u2026 That\u2019s what I took away from AA, and maybe now I\u2019m having problems again because no matter how hard I try, I cannot emulate that feeling of security and support through the chaos of life. Maybe I should go to AA myself, but I can\u2019t &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the past year, I\u2019ve been drinking a 750 ml bottle of Patron every 1-2 days. I quit that 3 months ago.  Now I\u2019ve been dealing with Xanax since then. For a while, I would just take a quarter, only when I would have a really bad panic attack. Then recently I started taking it more because I wanted to feel numb but I didn\u2019t have my liquid crutch to stand on. I\u2019m up to 2 bars a day, at least 4 times a week, and even then I don\u2019t even feel good from it anymore I just get tired and wanna die. And when I don\u2019t have it, I wanna die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been going days into a whole week without leaving my bed. I literally just cry and cry until my eyes are almost swollen shut and it hurts. I want back the innocence of being a child. Life sucks\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This long story all boils down to my recent relapse in self-harm. I\u2019ve actually changed my methods- cutting leaves noticeable marks especially on the arms and makes everyone disappointed and sad when they see it (there\u2019s only so long before I slip up and show it by accident). I\u2019ve been scratching/picking again, and I\u2019ve been punching myself or hitting myself in the head with blunt objects. This makes me feel insane and sick. I have bruises all over my thighs now, right next to the old scars and 4 new ones. Luckily all I had in that moment were some dull-ass child scissors so the new cuts are very shallow, it\u2019s not about the blood for me, just the feeling of physical release\u2026 This is sick and I need to stop, but hitting myself is like a knee-jerk reaction now. I don\u2019t need any tools, or privacy, or a way to clean it up or hide it afterwards. It\u2019s too easy and sometimes I feel like I won\u2019t ever be able to stop and that I will never be able to find happiness and peace within my own mind. My problems aren\u2019t so big, my life isn\u2019t so bad, but I just can\u2019t fucking deal and that makes me even more angry with myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t have anyone I can talk to about this. I feel especially weird because I am 25 years old and self-harm is mostly associated with teenagers, I don\u2019t know anyone else my age with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t want to burden my husband anymore, he\u2019s coming to his breaking point. He says he can\u2019t handle this shit anymore, I\u2019m too much. I need to get help or I\u2019m going to lose the only person that still gives me reason to be alive through this darkness. He\u2019s such an amazing, beautiful person with so much to offer this world and I\u2019m just holding him back\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all think I\u2019m bipolar and need to go to an in-patient treatment program that works with substance abuse and mental health. I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t leave my job for an extended period of time and I have a good job, I do not have a college education and I make about $40,000 a year for a company who actually respects me and appreciates my hard work. I had a whole week of no-call, no-show because I just couldn\u2019t get out of bed and bring myself to call in and explain what I was going through\u2026 When I finally called at the end of the week, I told them I\u2019ve struggled my whole life with mental health and had a rough time\u2026 no questions asked, they took me right back. How can I leave that behind?? What if all that time away from me makes my husband realize his life is better off without me?? What if nothing changes, and I\u2019m just fucked up and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it?? Or they commit me against my will forever?? Haha, okay that last part was a little dramatic\u2026  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But seriously, I\u2019m very afraid of both getting help, and not getting help\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do. I just want to be free to feel happy. It feels so good to come out in the light, and going back into the darkness is the worst part. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose who I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for the long post. I used to be a writer, and I haven&amp;#39;t read a book or written anything creatively in years. It felt good to get it all out :) Plus I&amp;#39;ve never had an outlet for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who reads all the way through :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is my first Reddit post, I just joined today. My husband recommended it to me because he\u2019s been reading the pages on opiate recovery, which I am proud to say he is almost 10 months clean after nearly 10 years of the struggle. I am so very proud :) Anyway, he pointed me in this direction to look for help with my own issues with self-harm, mental health, and alcohol/substance abuse.\n\nI started cutting myself when I was like 15, I didn\u2019t know any other way to get out all the physical rage that I was feeling. Like chest crushing, can\u2019t breathe, wanna-smash-my-own-face-in-with-a-hammer-type rage.\n\nThose feelings started after I was sexually assaulted by a friend. We had become really close very quickly, and he had a plethora of his own psychotic issues\u2026 I introduced him to my best friend and they started dating, and we were like a fun trio that was inseparable\u2026 One night he was staying at my house, and after a few drinks, he kept giving Klonopin pills and before I knew it he was on top of me. My body was almost limp, I had no power to fight him and I couldn\u2019t speak right\u2026 I had my period, so he didn\u2019t wanna put it there, so he forced me to suck his dick but since I was crying so much I guess it wasn\u2019t very good, so he fucked my tits instead and came all over me. Then he just went upstairs to the couch and fell asleep while I cried my eyes out the whole night, alone in my basement bedroom. The next morning I woke him up, brought him home, and went straight to my best friend\u2019s house to tell her what happened. I had bruises on both my arms from him holding me down. Deep down I still feel like I betrayed her like I cheated with her boyfriend... I should have known what was coming. I should have screamed for my parents, or bit his dick to make him stop\u2026.. I don\u2019t even know if you would call it rape, but it definitely feels like I was raped that night. But it still feels like my own fault.\n\nAfter that, I started hanging out with another bad group of guys, who also treated me badly and influenced my drug use even further. I had always smoked pot and drank, and had dabbled in benzos, but I started taking lots of molly- back when molly actually was MDMA and not fucking bath salts and shit\u2026 I nearly lost my mind for real a couple times on the come-down, fucking psychosis\u2026\n\nAnyway, it was around that time that I began cutting on a regular basis. Not to kill myself, just because it was the only thing that made me stop crying. I would have bad anxiety attacks, my brain would get stuck in really negative thought-loops and nothing would give my brain peace except some kind of physical pain. Instant relief, like a literal weight lifting off my chest and I could breathe again.\n\nI know drug use  exacerbates these issues, but I had these feelings as a little kid. I would scratch my arms up or bang my head into the wall sometimes out of frustration. I was actually a very happy child, even though I saw a lot of fighting and moved around a lot. My parents would fist fight, I woke up to my Dad being put into the back of a cop car in handcuffs one night. We lived with grandparents, friends, and even a few shelters for abused women and children. As crazy as that all sounds, those were the best years of my life. Growing up in the chaos was hard, but experiencing such a network of support was extremely comforting. I learned so much by going to AA meetings with my mom, too. She didn\u2019t have money to pay for a sitter and I was a very well behaved child so I would come with her several times a week and listen to the stories of these people who have experienced so much and learned from it and became better\u2026 That\u2019s what I took away from AA, and maybe now I\u2019m having problems again because no matter how hard I try, I cannot emulate that feeling of security and support through the chaos of life. Maybe I should go to AA myself, but I can\u2019t \n\nFor the past year, I\u2019ve been drinking a 750 ml bottle of Patron every 1-2 days. I quit that 3 months ago.  Now I\u2019ve been dealing with Xanax since then. For a while, I would just take a quarter, only when I would have a really bad panic attack.

I&amp;#39;m not going to go into much detail but I had a rather rough childhood. The youngest of a family of four with no father and we were living next to poverty level for a rather long time.

I only knew it as a word and the reason that my father was not around. Going to a large public school as a new kid I felt alone, I remember the first time I self-harmed was at the age of 12. It very quickly progressed, within 6 months my school caught wind and my mom was made aware. I was not put into therapy and it continued to manifest my life. It became how I coped with everyday life.

Even though I came to the realization on my own I needed to change, my school refused to take me back after this event.

I felt worthless that I was deemed unfit to be allowed in public schooling. Even though I had made exponential progress while attending this school I was told I would not be returning to public school. (This was not true, however, I did end up going to my local high school) This made my depression and self-harm worse than ever before and I somehow managed to keep it hidden and never went back to the hospital.

I&amp;#39;ve heard it&amp;#39;s good to talk about the purpose self-harm has to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don\u2019t know where to start. I have never been able verbalize my emotions. My really good friends over the years have always become frustrated because they can tell I\u2019m hurting, they can tell I\u2019m depressed, but I\u2019ve never been able to discuss it in a rational way. In the past I get angry, irrational, and then pull away from any help because I feel so guilty not knowing how to explain what I\u2019m going through. I\u2019ve ruined at least 3 friendships this way. I know I\u2019m hurting, I know I\u2019m depressed but that\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t know how to describe my emotions, I don\u2019t know what exactly triggers them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I go through low times, like everyone else, and that\u2019s what starts it. But I always try to handle the situation in stride and be okay with everything but then after a little bit I don\u2019t know how to react and implode. It\u2019s not an intentional \u201cpushing down\u201d of feelings, it\u2019s just an overwhelming physical feeling I don\u2019t know what to do with. It\u2019s hard to describe it... But one thing is for sure, everything bad always turns into anger, guilt, and shame. I know those feelings very well. That\u2019s what starts the self-harm. That triad of emotions gets me every time. Thinking clearly right now, it can be from 2 ways, possibly both intertwined. 1. When I hurt myself, when I feel the pain, I don\u2019t think of anything I\u2019ve done wrong, I don\u2019t think of anyone, all I can think about is the sharp pain and how I want it to continue. 2. I feel these feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and I feel I should be punished, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling these feelings but I should have a reason but then when I hurt myself I have a reason. After I hurt myself I have a good reason to be angry at myself and feel guilt and shame from lying and hiding this from everyone. Then I feel I should be punished. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the moment it\u2019s all blurry because I spend an hour or more in thought cycles trying to resist the urges, so these 2 points may not be the only reasons. But it\u2019s a start. The next question I believe I need to ask myself is, why does this initial feeling of anger, guilt, and shame start\u2026 I\u2019m not sure but just spit-balling here, maybe it\u2019s because I always try to be the strong one, the perfect one. When something bad happens in my life I want to be that person who has the answers, who handles it with poise, the one who people can turn to in crisis. I guess when I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing that, when I feel hurt and sadness, I don\u2019t know what to do. So I get angry and feel guilt and shame because I\u2019m not handling that situation like I should have. That\u2019s just an idea. I don\u2019t really know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m trying to think back to my first self-harm, when I was 15\u2026 I was hard on myself as a kid. I had a hard time separating what I wanted for myself and what everyone else wanted from me\u2026 Hell, I still have a hard time with that. Disappointment is my worst fear. It always has been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my first call to action should be at least recognizing when this feeling of guilt, shame, and anger starts and why they\u2019re there. That\u2019s step one. Breakdown those feelings\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do once I get to sadness or whatever those other feelings are but I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about them\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t, right?... I don\u2019t know. Maybe it depends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being sad scares me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past year has been hard. These past 6 months have been harder. I\u2019ve had 2 really good friends pass away this year\u2026 I can\u2019t talk about them yet. My parents got divorced, and while I know that\u2019s pretty standard now, I still am struggling with it and can\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ve started a new career where I can\u2019t find the place I want to be. And all my friends are at least 3 hours away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not trying to bitch, it\u2019s just been a tough time. And without friends I trust to see at least weekly it makes processing things hard. Maybe after I get in more control I can discuss these things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know we\u2019ll see. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you to anyone reading.

I\u2019ve ruined at least 3 friendships this way. I know I\u2019m hurting, I know I\u2019m depressed but that\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t know how to describe my emotions, I don\u2019t know what exactly triggers them. \n\nI know I go through low times, like everyone else, and that\u2019s what starts it. But I always try to handle the situation in stride and be okay with everything but then after a little bit I don\u2019t know how to react and implode. It\u2019s not an intentional \u201cpushing down\u201d of feelings, it\u2019s just an overwhelming physical feeling I don\u2019t know what to do with. It\u2019s hard to describe it... But one thing is for sure, everything bad always turns into anger, guilt, and shame. I know those feelings very well. That\u2019s what starts the self-harm. That triad of emotions gets me every time. Thinking clearly right now, it can be from 2 ways, possibly both intertwined. 1. When I hurt myself, when I feel the pain, I don\u2019t think of anything I\u2019ve done wrong, I don\u2019t think of anyone, all I can think about is the sharp pain and how I want it to continue. 2. I feel these feelings of anger, guilt, and shame and I feel I should be punished, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling these feelings but I should have a reason but then when I hurt myself I have a reason. After I hurt myself I have a good reason to be angry at myself and feel guilt and shame from lying and hiding this from everyone. Then I feel I should be punished. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. \n\nIn the moment it\u2019s all blurry because I spend an hour or more in thought cycles trying to resist the urges, so these 2 points may not be the only reasons. But it\u2019s a start. The next question I believe I need to ask myself is, why does this initial feeling of anger, guilt, and shame start\u2026 I\u2019m not sure but just spit-balling here, maybe it\u2019s because I always try to be the strong one, the perfect one. When something bad happens in my life I want to be that person who has the answers, who handles it with poise, the one who people can turn to in crisis. I guess when I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing that, when I feel hurt and sadness, I don\u2019t know what to do. So I get angry and feel guilt and shame because I\u2019m not handling that situation like I should have. That\u2019s just an idea. I don\u2019t really know. \n\nI\u2019m trying to think back to my first self-harm, when I was 15\u2026 I was hard on myself as a kid. I had a hard time separating what I wanted for myself and what everyone else wanted from me\u2026 Hell, I still have a hard time with that. Disappointment is my worst fear. It always has been.\n\nI guess my first call to action should be at least recognizing when this feeling of guilt, shame, and anger starts and why they\u2019re there. That\u2019s step one. Breakdown those feelings\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do once I get to sadness or whatever those other feelings are but I shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about them\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t, right?... I don\u2019t know. Maybe it depends.\n\nBeing sad scares me. \n\nThis past year has been hard. These past 6 months have been harder. I\u2019ve had 2 really good friends pass away this year\u2026 I can\u2019t talk about them yet. My parents got divorced, and while I know that\u2019s pretty standard now, I still am struggling with it and can\u2019t talk about it. I\u2019ve started a new career where I can\u2019t find the place I want to be. And all my friends are at least 3 hours away. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to bitch, it\u2019s just been a tough time. And without friends I trust to see at least weekly it makes processing things hard. Maybe after I get in more control I can discuss these things. \n\nI don\u2019t know we\u2019ll see. \n\nThank you to anyone reading. Encouragement and advice is appreciated. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "77cioy", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I've relapsed and am trying to get back in control of my self-harm.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sigz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_77cioy", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/77cioy/ive_relapsed_and_am_trying_to_get_back_in_control/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508420382.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/77cioy/ive_relapsed_and_am_trying_to_get_back_in_control/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "jkicker24", "created_utc": 1508391582.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StopSelfHarm", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.StopSelfHarm", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "StopSelfHarm", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started hurting myself around 4 months ago.

At least if she was telling me \"I don't believe you can make an A\" id be like beech u thot, but no, it's just her putting down all my efforts making me feel like total shit, making me literally LOSE all my motivation, and making me want to just give up, bc what's the point? If I try hard and make an A, she'll be like \"I told you so\", if I try hard and make a B, she'll be like \"you didn't put in the effort\", if I don't try hard and make an A, win, and if I don't try hard and make a B, she'll still yell at me for not putting in the effort. So why would I even attempt if those are my only outcomes? The worst part is I already relapsed in cutting over the summer with my B in orgo 1, and I was clean for 3 years. \n\n3 years. \n\nI can't go through this again. I...I just can't.

I told him about 20 mins later. \n\nAnyway, we got in a huge blow up on Wednesday night. His crazy popped off (that's what he calls it) and he screamed and cussed and threatened me. Then he left. I was able to handle it and went to bed.  The next day, however, I wasn't so strong. Cut myself kinda bad. \n\nSo the shitty part is he left his phone here, and he has no problem going off the grid. I thought I would finally talk to him tonight, I even called his work, but he blew me off and now he's clearly not coming over to resolve things. \n\nAnyway, the point is, all I want to do is cut. Cut to blood. It'll help me relax and finally sleep. I know it's bad and I shouldn't do it. Please, tell me how not to. I feel like if I do it now, I'll cut too deep and have to deal with the consequences. I already have burn marks on my rib age as well as cuts, and cuts all over my legs. \n\nJust make me stop.

now, but the things i would use in order to have a healthy outlet for my feelings or distract myself, have now become things i punish myself over by way of self harming. i used to love drawing and doing art, but now whenever i draw i am overwhelmed with feelings of failure and i get frustrated with myself. especially as i&amp;#39;ve gotten older, being that i&amp;#39;m currently 26, i feel i am very unskilled for my age despite the fact i&amp;#39;ve been drawing since childhood, whereas people almost half my age are creating amazing works and nail down the things i have issues with. i am happy for young artists because i can tell they work hard, but i can&amp;#39;t help the times i get bursts of venemous jealousy. and i know it&amp;#39;s because even when i try to do studies to improve myself, and it&amp;#39;s not good enough, i punish myself by way of self harming. this has caused a vicious cycle where to stop the SH urges, i avoid doing art. but because i avoid doing art, i make very little progress and remain unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the same thing with video games has been happening too. i use them as a distraction, but if i make mistakes, then i feel horrible about myself and hurt myself over that too. though there are some games that are more chill, playing them over and over can get a little dull after a while, and i want to go back to the faster paced, higher action games. only due to lack of practice, i fail at them and i hurt myself, and avoid those games again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i am already in therapy, but i have several mental

to fix this, or if there are any short term solutions for when i get sudden, overwhelming urges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "this has been happening over the course of a few years now, but the things i would use in order to have a healthy outlet for my feelings or distract myself, have now become things i punish myself over by way of self harming. i used to love drawing and doing art, but now whenever i draw i am overwhelmed with feelings of failure and i get frustrated with myself. especially as i've gotten older, being that i'm currently 26, i feel i am very unskilled for my age despite the fact i've been drawing since childhood, whereas people almost half my age are creating amazing works and nail down the things i have issues with. i am happy for young artists because i can tell they work hard, but i can't help the times i get bursts of venemous jealousy. and i know it's because even when i try to do studies to improve myself, and it's not good enough, i punish myself by way of self harming. this has caused a vicious cycle where to stop the SH urges, i avoid doing art. but because i avoid doing art, i make very little progress and remain unsatisfied.\n\nthe same thing with video games has been happening too. i use them as a distraction, but if i make mistakes, then i feel horrible about myself and hurt myself over that too. though there are some games that are more chill, playing them over and over can get a little dull after a while, and i want to go back to the faster paced, higher action games. only due to lack of practice, i fail at them and i hurt myself, and avoid those games again.\n\ni am already in therapy, but i have several mental health problems i'm working on (like my ocd, depression and agoraphobia), so it's hard to tackle all issues in just 1hr sessions per week. also, my therapist is off on holiday for the next fortnight and while i've tried very hard for most of this year to avoid harming as

I still get urges, but I never want to revert back to how I was when I was at my worst.\n\nI feel so much shame and regret now.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6uw78z", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My Best Friend Cut Me (How My Self Injury Began)", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 3, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sigz", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1504286176.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6uw78z", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/6uw78z/my_best_friend_cut_me_how_my_self_injury_began/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1503270447.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/6uw78z/my_best_friend_cut_me_how_my_self_injury_began/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "CupOfCakes666", "created_utc": 1503241647.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StopSelfHarm", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.StopSelfHarm", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "StopSelfHarm", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, about two years ago I started cutting, and I became really addicted to it, and it swallowed me and I really thought it actually even helped not to get sad, and ended up pretty bad.

I really don't think I have one (the only symptom is slight dizziness that has mostly gone away, plus a mild headache that is probably from the emotional drama), but it still made me very nervous (and honestly, I still am).\n\nI am seeing a therapist. She is the second one I've tried, and I've been seeing her for about a month now. I think I should bring this up next week, but it makes me very nervous. My biggest fear from therapy is loosing control, due to being told that a therapist from when I was a teenager wanted to 'lock me up'.\n\nThanks for listening, and any advice would be appreciated.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6oklpk", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Thinking I need to do something about my problem", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 2, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sigz", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6oklpk", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/6oklpk/thinking_i_need_to_do_something_about_my_problem/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1500627051.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/6oklpk/thinking_i_need_to_do_something_about_my_problem/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "throwaway71303", "created_utc": 1500598251.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StopSelfHarm", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.StopSelfHarm", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "StopSelfHarm", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a schizophrenic dealing with an episode rn.

The most recent was last week at work when I kept messing something easy up. It can be extremely satisfying in the moment, but afterwards I develop headaches and my self hatred cycle resets itselfs. I hate myself for feeling like this and doing things to harm myself. If I don't punch myself, the next closest thing is slamming it into something. I'll bash my forehead against things like my steering wheel, the frame of my car, a wall, etc. I already have CTE from a decade of american football, I don't care about doing more damage. I'm already fucked in the head. \n\nI'm getting close to the 2nd anniversary of my mom's sudden death and I feel responsible for it. I was hysterical, I wasn't making sense to the operator and I screwed up doing CPR. I feel like I screwed up and I have to take it out on myself. I failed my mom and my family, now I deserve pain. I can't let that down and I can't really talk about it with anyone outside of counseling. My family has pretty much ignored it, no one has say one thing about it. I can't share my feelings with anyone apart from 2 hours a week, and even then I can barely do so because of my lack of social skills. Which is another reason I hate myself\n\nMy head won't let up with the self hatred, it just won't stop. I can't do anything right and I feel like I need to harm myself. Punching myself or slamming my head into something seems really tempting right now.

Last year I cut myself a couple times because of things going on with my family but since then I had been happy. I just started middle school (in 2K16, I know, I&amp;#39;m young) and lost my best friend in the summer. I made a new friend and plenty of others. I got in a fight with that new friend after about 6 months, we decided to end our friendship and it didn&amp;#39;t phase me. I began to be more bitchy (cursing, makeup, talking back, not doing homework, not studying, etc.) but my friends stayed my friends. I became nicer (at least I think) and was really happy with life. Towards the end of the school year, I became obsessed with becoming popular and my insecurity started. I would look in the mirror and want to be someone else, call myself names, wear makeup to hide pimples, etc. On the 2nd to last day of school, I got into this horrible fight with a friend. I thought I had lost all of my friends (since most of them took her side) and just went home and cried. The friend I got into a fight with sent another girl (an 8th grader) after me. I had already been insecure and this girl went and called me a self-centered bitch, rude, mean, horrible, nasty, etc. I broke down and started crying. I sobbed for at least 30 minutes. Another friend (i thought she hated me) called me and tried to explain while I was just there sobbing. I took a shower and was still sobbing in the shower. To make myself stop sobbing I cut myself (I used scissors but it&amp;#39;s still a blade). Whenever I feel or see scissors I cut myself.

Of course, I&amp;#39;ve found many helpful sites but those are all directed towards adults and older people while I am only 12 and going into 7th grade.\nNow back to present time.

I want to tell my family/mom about my possible depression and getting therapy but they all think I am so happy (and sometimes I am).

I may (or not) tell my brother about my situation and see if he can help. If anyone has any advice for me I&amp;#39;d love to hear it.

I need to get this out so I don&amp;#39;t go back to hurting myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, after tentatively meeting a few people from the application Skout, I met some we&amp;#39;ll call George. George is 25M, I am 27F. I have recently gotten out of a five year relationship and I thought I was upfront with not being able to become emotionally invested in someone at this point in time when George and I started sleeping with one another. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He introduced me to his family as a friend, as well as his friends. It&amp;#39;s very nice to feel welcomed into something, please don&amp;#39;t take this the wrong way. It&amp;#39;s very nice of him to open up his life like this to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve got some serious problems up in my head. I have urges to self harm, which get worse when I&amp;#39;m triggered. I have anxiety, to the point of agoraphobia at times. I fear social interaction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve worked with psychiatrists and therapists for 5 years to get where I am now, where I can go outside without having a panic attack. During that five years I dedicated myself completely to someone who took advantage of my kind nature and my wanting to help them. I became very codependent on them. They did not intend for it to happen, but I became obsessed with helping them beat their depression and inner demons. That was not my place but I felt like it was. He always told me he could never lie to me, that I made him happy, that I was all he ever needed in life, but he also always needed money for weed or medication or gas or food. Or pants. Or socks. Or his phone bill. Really anything that required money, I provided him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to George now. We met and hit it off in bed. I made it clear we must use condoms, as it seems that I contracted hepatitis C from my previous relationship. (I have an appointment with a specialist to confirm this coming up. My GP isn&amp;#39;t positive I have it, but if I understand correctly, I tested positive for antibodies which means I have been exposed and most likely have it.) He agrees they are important and we have our fun. We have fun a few times over the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days ago he messages me with an idea he had. He asked me to infect him with hepatitis C in return for a monogamous relationship with him. I immediately declined and asked him why he thought he needed to contract hepatitis C to be monogamous with me. I don&amp;#39;t remember his answer exactly, I don&amp;#39;t remember him quite explaining it. He just brushed it off by saying it was a silly idea or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I hung out with his friends and him, and it was a bit strained but not completely awkward. One of them was sad over the death of a friend. While drinking, I heard him say, &amp;quot;Who doesn&amp;#39;t like getting keyed up once in a while?&amp;quot; He was speaking about cocaine. In the past he has had problems with chemical dependency, but hasn&amp;#39;t used cocaine in at least a year I believe. Red flag? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spoke to him after about how if we&amp;#39;re to be anything, he needs to get his life together. Go time sort of talk. Mentioning things like getting health insurance, which he said he&amp;#39;s not concerned about because he has Medicaid, which is ultimately understandable. He was previously worried about losing it, hence me bringing up getting health insurance. I don&amp;#39;t know if he has a bank account in his name. I was trying to mention basic life things that I could see were an issue for him to some extent. He took it as me trying to mother him when I told him he was using weed to deal with things. Telling him he needs to get his shit together is also mothering him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I went over to get my car which I left the night before after being too tired to drive. He invited me in and started chopping up tortillas while talking to me. He wanted to do a live stream of him cooking, he told me. Then his friend stopped by and I asked if she and her friend wanted to go get coffee. I figured George wanted to do his livestream thing, so I did not invite him as he was in pajama pants and was pretty focused on making something food wise. He acts dejected that I haven&amp;#39;t invited him, even though it seems he is not ready/wanting to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m out with his friends, someone gets on his livestream and trolls him until he rage quits. (His words) He quotes them saying &amp;quot;Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?&amp;quot;. I reply that it sounds like it might be a wake up call. I now understand how insensative this was, and I&amp;#39;m not quite sure why I said it the way I did. But I did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tries calling me but my Sim card wasn&amp;#39;t loaded properly and I wasn&amp;#39;t getting the calls. I text him back and he&amp;#39;s getting frustrated I&amp;#39;m not answering. I go to the park to calm down after so much social interaction. He calls me 5 times in a row (so he says) and says he&amp;#39;s done calling me. Then tells me to call his house phone. I call and we talk, I&amp;#39;m a mess at this point, crying while slowly walking around this nice park, trying to not look distressed and make passers-by think something is wrong. I don&amp;#39;t remember most of what was said because it was so upsetting. I handled it calmly as he yelled at me for treating him the way I did, cursing at me and saying &amp;quot;Who do you think you are?&amp;quot; and similar things trying to engage me in this fight I&amp;#39;m not participating in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After getting off the phone, I drive home and am late for family dinner. I text him letting him know what&amp;#39;s going on. He calls me. I say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m in the mide of dinner right now and can&amp;#39;t talk.&amp;quot; He responds, &amp;quot;Great&amp;quot; sarcastically. I go over to his house after dinner to return his book &amp;quot;Codependent no more&amp;quot; and we talk. I apologize for what I said, he apologized for his attitude, I continued feeling a growing hatred towards myself for making this social mistake. He tells me I have to be more pragmatic. He tells me I can&amp;#39;t just walk out and leave. His friends will think he did something to me. He doesn&amp;#39;t open up to people well and he has opened up to me. He can&amp;#39;t just let me walk away he says. He says that is escapism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When  I picked up my car at the beginning of the day, I saw a rusty razor blade on his porch. I informed him it was triggering to me, and requested he throw it away as I handed it to him from the floor. Since then I have been struggling with the idea of buying razor blades to cut myself with. I used to do this as a coping mechanism. I still struggle with thoughts of self harm quite frequently. Today has been the worst in a long time now since I&amp;#39;ve stopped hurting myself. I really wanted to stop at Home Depot to pick some up. I like new, clean ones for a lower risk of tetnis. I am instead posting here. (and have not bought any!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any and all advice will be considered if you&amp;#39;ve made it this far. If you have any questions, I will try to answer them fully and honestly.

I need to get this out so I don't go back to hurting myself. \n\n\nA few weeks ago, after tentatively meeting a few people from the application Skout, I met some we'll call George. George is 25M, I am 27F. I have recently gotten out of a five year relationship and I thought I was upfront with not being able to become emotionally invested in someone at this point in time when George and I started sleeping with one another. \n\nHe introduced me to his family as a friend, as well as his friends. It's very nice to feel welcomed into something, please don't take this the wrong way. It's very nice of him to open up his life like this to me. \n\nBut I've got some serious problems up in my head. I have urges to self harm, which get worse when I'm triggered. I have anxiety, to the point of agoraphobia at times. I fear social interaction. \n\nI've worked with psychiatrists and therapists for 5 years to get where I am now, where I can go outside without having a panic attack. During that five years I dedicated myself completely to someone who took advantage of my kind nature and my wanting to help them. I became very codependent on them. They did not intend for it to happen, but I became obsessed with helping them beat their depression and inner demons. That was not my place but I felt like it was. He always told me he could never lie to me, that I made him happy, that I was all he ever needed in life, but he also always needed money for weed or medication or gas or food. Or pants. Or socks. Or his phone bill. Really anything that required money, I provided him. \n\nBack to George now. We met and hit it off in bed. I made it clear we must use condoms, as it seems that I contracted hepatitis C from my previous relationship. (I have an appointment with a specialist to confirm this coming up.

My father and I never really got along, so I think it started as a way for me to fantasize punishing him.  I was frequently bullied growing up and gradually suicide became more of a way out.  This progressed from fantasies to self harm in college when my freshman year, the first time I was really drunk, I cut my wrists.

So I have no support structure here.  Well, lately I&amp;#39;ve been struggling at work.  I am being asked to lead a much larger project than I ever have in the past, and I am not sure how.  I&amp;#39;ve asked my boss for guidance but she hasn&amp;#39;t been the most helpful.

I have obviously bad eating habits, like fast food, and soda.  My boss&amp;#39;s boss is British and often criticizes the way Americans eat.  Normally I don&amp;#39;t take this too personally, because I know I eat like shit.  But today was different.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My office recently instituted a policy where they will not bring in soda for catering during meetings and events.  That&amp;#39;s fine, we are supposedly a health focused company (though we make shit like ice cream and candy, so that&amp;#39;s kind of a load of crap, but it is the corporate kool-aid).  This kinda disappointed me, but it didn&amp;#39;t bother me since I can always just grab a soda at the vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matter&amp;#39;s worse, I&amp;#39;ve been having some money problems lately as I&amp;#39;ve had some increased expenses lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also over the last few days, I&amp;#39;ve just seen a lot of news articles about how soda is bad for you, even if it is diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So finally all of this came to a boil today at work.  My boss&amp;#39;s boss was having a meeting, and was doing the normal &amp;#39;can I get you a water or coffee&amp;#39; thing, but he also added &amp;#39;or a soda, I know how you American&amp;#39;s like those&amp;#39;.  The person he was with said something to the effect of &amp;#39;No, I don&amp;#39;t drink soda, but I know what you mean.  Those people who drink soda are disgusting.&amp;#39;  My boss&amp;#39;s boss laughs and begins to agree with him, then realizes I&amp;#39;m within ear shot.  He then gets real quiet so I can&amp;#39;t hear what is being said, just that they are still talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This just finally broke my will.  It was all I could do not to cry right there at my desk.  I went and hid in a conference room choking back tears.  When work was over, I walked to my car wearing my sunglasses in the building, and in the elevator, crying on the way.  During my drive home all I could think about was killing myself, and how I would have to drive my cat to California and leave him with my parents so he would have someone to take care of him when I killed myself.  When I got home, I began to self harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was about an hour and a half ago.  I&amp;#39;m still crying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t talk to anyone about this, because I can&amp;#39;t put that burden on them.  My one good friend lives about 12 hours from me, and I recently confessed to him about my suicide attempt and continued suicidal fantasies, but I&amp;#39;ve never told him about my continued self harm.  I feel if I tell him, he will feel responsible for trying to &amp;#39;fix&amp;#39; me, which I think is an unfair thing for him to have to deal with.  I&amp;#39;ve had so much privilege in my life, and him so little, how can I ask him to have sympathy for me.  My depression feels deeply selfish in this way, which only makes it worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told my mom of my depression, and hinted at my suicidal thoughts and actions, but her response is always &amp;#39;you have to find God&amp;#39;.  I don&amp;#39;t believe in God, and for a long time she was very angry at me for not believing until she finally started to act like she accepts it.  But every time she says I need to find God, it just feels like another jab at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to begin with finding help, but at least writing this all up has helped.  I know I need to eat healthier and exercise, and I have lost 50 pounds since moving to the Midwest, but I&amp;#39;ve plateaued lately.  I want to give up soda, but food and sugary drinks have always been a source of comfort that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to easily replace, but I know this isn&amp;#39;t a fitness sub so I wont ask for help with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if no one reads or comments, I&amp;#39;m just happy this sub was here so I can put my emotions into words and thus try and cope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am no longer having suicidal thoughts at the moment, so &lt;a href=\"/r/suicidewatch\"&gt;/r/suicidewatch&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#39;t feel appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Today, for the first time in a few months, I've self harmed, and had serious suicidal thoughts.\n    \nBackground: I've had suicidal thoughts since childhood.

It was back in university, I failed to do something right, and I let myself perceive the backlash as a major defining point of myself. It just simply felt bad to the point that I thought in general, I&amp;#39;m just a person whose characteristics are ill-equipped for a successful life. Instead of trying to fix it on my own, I let it get to me even further. I thought maybe if I could identify myself as a severely depressed person, I could maximize the amount of assistance I&amp;#39;d get. So I was visibly depressed, and my father, who didn&amp;#39;t really see it, instead voiced his frustration about how un-interactive I was. For the most part, I have social anxiety. In social situations, I&amp;#39;ll become the least interactive person. I believe that stems from my childhood experience at school, where I was the one kid to be neglected by many, bullied by the few, and befriended by a small handful for the sole purpose of avoiding looking like a lonesome loser or as a way to kill time during recess. He went too far, and instead of trying to disregard it, I intentionally tried to echo his words in my head. I think these habits have been engraved deeply into my subconscious decision-making, and I believe it has done a lot of damage to my social life. I utterly hate myself for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So imagine having two contagiously-depressed people making life worse for each other. That&amp;#39;s how my long-distance girlfriend and I broke up. Ironic thing is - what I meant by my father going too far with his vented frustration at my idleness - &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;ll never get a girlfriend in the future.&amp;quot; Ironic, isn&amp;#39;t it? He did have a point, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, I then had more reason to feel down, and I probably felt more down than was needed. I mean to rephrase, yeah, I may have been depressed, but if that&amp;#39;s the case, I was also artificially very depressed. I had finally been prescribed escitalopram. It was nice, I mean, I stopped being very easily provoked into a rage, which is very unlike myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I have social anxiety, most of my friends are those from all over the world, online. Became really good friends with Katie. She re-introduced me back into playing RuneScape, which I&amp;#39;ll explain the relevance in the next paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A year later, when I had been trying to turn my life around and see more people, my lack of social skills had led to a confrontation with someone who only did their due diligence to do what was right. I hate getting into details about what happened, but let&amp;#39;s say they successfully convinced me I&amp;#39;m less than a person - a freak, a creep, a monster, a black mark on society. For the first time, I resorted to self-harm. I made a few cuts on my left forearm, and the scars are annoyingly still there today. I did it to relieve myself of the guilt for being such a terrible subhuman. I considered suicide, prepared for suicide, but instead got help. I was prescribed bupropion HCl, and Abilify to boost the effects of escitalopram, but I think they&amp;#39;ve been a waste of money for years. I slept a lot, missed classes, and was unprepared for my final exams on my final year, but the Dean&amp;#39;s office was completely understanding, and although I felt terrible, guilty for having to ask for an alternative final exam schedule, most of my exams were postponed to a month later. What really made me feel guilty was that I didn&amp;#39;t use my time awake to study or prepare for exams ; I used it to play RuneScape. I felt like it was an effective simulator - to experience that satisfaction when you&amp;#39;ve completed a major achievement in life. But to this day, I still feel there is some degree of truth of being a subhuman, so I also hate myself for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of last year, I took every hint I could to believe that my 4-year friendship with Katie was coming to an end. After work, I&amp;#39;d feel super down, until I talk to Katie, present her with a pessimistic statement, and hope she corrects it to something more optimistic. But once again, two depressed people dragging each other down don&amp;#39;t work too well. I did try to offer her support, but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m just the person she opens up to for discussion any more. So essentially, she&amp;#39;s trying to help me, pick me up, and when she does, I&amp;#39;m sandbagging my own weight on her. After a while, she&amp;#39;d had enough of it, blocked me on every social media platform because I had been harassing her. I thought she was bad or fake as a friend, but I can&amp;#39;t deny my part in it. So I now take full accountability for what happened. That too - I also hate myself for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I had no choice but to start talking to others. But then I&amp;#39;d reveal myself to be a heavy sandbag full of problems. They were kind at first, and I had great expectations, but then they&amp;#39;d end up vanishing from my life. It was like there&amp;#39;s something on my face. It&amp;#39;s like I have the face of a horrific ghoul that scares them away. I dwelled on it, and the phrase &amp;quot;is there something on my face&amp;quot; to the point I took it literally, and went back to self-harm, but on my face. My co-workers think I got mauled by a cat in the face, but I won&amp;#39;t correct them. Because there&amp;#39;s something fundamentally flawed about me, I presume was the cause of all the runaway friends, I really, really hated myself for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RuneScape having hosted a mental health awareness week, I thought I&amp;#39;d just go on that subreddit and ask. I got a few good answers. One of them analyzed myself to be a co-dependent. There&amp;#39;s something stupid about being identified as one. So I also hate myself for it, denied it, dismissed it as a miscommunication. It&amp;#39;s probably true. But the idea of it just sounds so pathetic, that I also really do hate myself for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember when I said I may have a subconscious thing for making things seem worse than it is? It just occurred to me while I&amp;#39;m typing this that it also applies to this case. While a few people had replied, more people were anonymously vocal against me through downvotes. I dismissed their advice as if they didn&amp;#39;t care - they only seem to care to avoid any legal responsibility should I actually kill myself. It was just a stupid excuse to force the perspective that everyone hates me, so that I have all the reason to just &lt;em&gt;disappear&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only time I didn&amp;#39;t hate myself was at work. I felt like an inconspicuous fit into a team of respectable, respectful, and productive members of a team. However, this is a long weekend in Canada, and I&amp;#39;m stuck away from work for longer than usual. And also by dwelling on the aforementioned perspective that I&amp;#39;m apparently the most hated, pathetic skid mark on the RuneScape community, which I clarified before why I was so heavily invested in, things just started escalating. I got more and more vocal on Twitter, and people just ridiculed and antagonized me for being hungry for attention. While I couldn&amp;#39;t agree with them at the time for being hungry for attention, I agreed that I was such a pathetic joke in the community. I mean these guys were really hostile. They&amp;#39;re the ones who would tweet at me how much they&amp;#39;re laughing at what a joke I am, and I had no counter-argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after getting a hailstorm of hate from a gaming community I&amp;#39;m heavily invested in for wanting attention. I felt they misunderstood my situation, and put a generalized &amp;quot;attention whore&amp;quot; cover me. I tried to correct them, but they continued to antagonize and ridicule me. I became a bad joke that I felt should be wiped off the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a quick and decisive stroke of the knife, but I missed the knife. Plenty of blood did come out. I went around on social media expressing my gratitude at those I felt deserved it, and flipped the bird at those who deserved such. I fell asleep, and I thought it&amp;#39;d be the last, but I woke up in a bloody mess. Nobody cared, and if they did, they also labelled me as being an attention seeker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good friend who I gave my &amp;quot;final&amp;quot; appreciation to, I gave a brief explanation that I just tried to kill myself, she walked me through the first aid process. She knew what she was doing. Hours later, before bed, she spoke to me again, this time following up on whether or not I&amp;#39;m okay, and gave her own two cents on depression. It was nice, but if only that kind of interaction would have defined my experience this weekend...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having such a terrible weekend, I can&amp;#39;t keep quiet about it. And every time I do, I&amp;#39;ll get shut down for being such a pathetic loser seeking attention. And while I believe most people wouldn&amp;#39;t even care if I successfully commit suicide, or even if that would make their day better, I presently no longer want anything to do with suicide. Just self-harm, because I really hate myself. For being a pathetic joke in a community I&amp;#39;m heavily invested in. I hate myself because I even tried to kill myself. I hate myself for wanting to speak out about this. I hate myself for making a big scene, and now my name is a just an embarrassing joke in the RuneScape community. I&amp;#39;m with them, that I hate me too. I hate myself for my past actions on the way I accept help from others. I hate myself for sandbagging my weight on Katie when she tried to help me. I almost went into a rage and wanted to just intensely apologize to her today, but she probably wants nothing to do with this anymore. I hate myself for losing respect from those I had a good connection with before, because to them, I&amp;#39;m just another desperate attention seeker. I hate myself for developing a habit of being too open about what&amp;#39;s on my mind - these people they don&amp;#39;t give a damn. I hate myself to the point I want to aggressively harm myself, but I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t. I just simply disgust myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I tried to take my own life yesterday.\n\nSo here's how my story with depression began.

This is a personal story of how I discovered that self-harm in prior years damaged more than just my physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a lightworker. This is a truth I discovered for myself some time in the last two to three years. As many lightworkers do, I suffered from depression (amongst other diagnoses) for many years. During this time period, I would self-harm. I have long since recovered and have abstained from self-injurious behavior for nearly four years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now live my life as an active lightworker, helping as many people in as many ways as I can. I have developed an acute focus on spirituality and have a strong connection with the metaphysical forces which aid me on my journey. I mention that primarily to mention the flip-side of the coin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After times of great lightworking success, I have sometimes been the target of psychic attack. These attacks, which come from some outside nefarious force, have the primary purpose of attempting to dissuade me from pursuing my lightworking mission in some way. At times, this damages my auric field significantly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those interested in how I determine this, it&amp;#39;s a relatively simple process. There are a few giveaways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, my auric field feels damaged. As I stated previously, I have a strong sense of the metaphysical, my auric field included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, this damage can manifest as physical symptoms, most commonly on the left side of the body. The body is polarized such that an entity of negative polarity can much more easily attack the left side than the right. I once had a hole blown in my auric field after a day of intense throat chakra work which resulted in deafness in the left ear. I remedied this through a meditative healing session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, and often the most obvious, is sleep disturbance. When I experience psychic attack, I most often experience one of the following: Nightmarish dreams, a struggle with the entity in the dream, an unpleasant feeling after waking up, or a ringing in my left ear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In these situations, depending on when I&amp;#39;m waking up, I usually ask for and envision divine protection, perform a banishing ritual, and above all else, send energies of love and light to the negative entity. It is my perspective that all life is one life, that the being simply knows not what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying all that to say this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I spent my day helping various people in various ways. It was a wonderful and rewarding experience; however, last night, I experienced a bout of profound psychic attack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up today, pretty quickly realizing what was going on. I sent out energies of love and light and asked for divine protection. One thing I did note, though, is that a large chunk of my auric field (ranging from my crown down to about my heart chakra) had been blown completely open. My energy felt incredibly imbalanced. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a heavy repair job, even for me, so I called upon the metaphysical forces which aid me on my journey to help repair my field. They, the fantastic beings that they are, set to work. As I stated previously, I have a strong connection with these beings; as such, we can communicate pretty clearly a lot of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a mass of negative energy, if you will, embedded in my field. the physical analogue of the location would be to the right of my left shoulder. I felt the energy being moved out of my field down my arm. Hands and arms in general are incredible energetic pathways, so this was the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the energy reached a point on my arm where all of my self-harm scars start. The movement became incredibly stagnated and I didn&amp;#39;t at first understand why. Thankfully, the forces aiding me communicated pretty clearly with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I was self-harming, I had torn my energetic field. Since the profoundly negative energies I was feeling had driven me to harm myself, each one of those wounds had blocked and torn that field further. This isn&amp;#39;t the place for details, but for reference, I will stay that such behaviors happened hundreds if not more than a thousand times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After making this revelation, there was more communication that I needn&amp;#39;t worry, that my field would be repaired. They thanked me for coming to them for this one instead of trying to do it myself. I thanked them, and after an exchange of love and light, I closed the healing session and got to work on repairing my arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The techniques I have used are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I asked those who aid me on my journey to aid in the healing process. They graciously have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, I went right for the best stone I know for repairing the auric field: Black kyanite. This is the best tool I know of for repairing tears and damage to the auric field. I can&amp;#39;t overstate how useful it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, I used Reiki. Reiki is a powerful tool for healing and repairing the energetic body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and more passively, I wear rings and bracelets. I knew that I wore them to help with energy flow and balancing, but now I more fully understand why. I wear labradorite, sapphire, tourmalated quartz, rudraksha and rudrani beads, turquoise, silver, and probably most importantly, copper. Each of these has its own unique properties, which, for the sake of completeness, I will detail below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Labradorite aids in seeing through illusion (the physical plane), increasing intuition and metaphysical connection. It balances energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sapphire releases tension, depression, and confusion. It aids in clarity and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tourmalated quartz contains both black tourmaline and quartz. Black tourmaline repels negative energy and aids in transmutation of negative into positive. It&amp;#39;s great for psychic protection. Clear quartz amplifies the energies of anything it shares a field with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rudraksha and rudrani beads together balance masculine and feminine energies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turquoise provides protection, helps with depression, and soothes the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silver purifies the body, brings protection, and increases intuition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Copper boosts energetic flow. It removes blockages and strengthens the current of all energies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These crystals, gemstones, and metals to which I have been drawn serve a few purposes, many of which now make sense. Besides intuition and protection, the primary function is to balance and increase my energy flow. In the context of having energetic blockages in my arms, this makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the steps I have taken today. I will continue to ask for assistance and have healing sessions with black kyanite and Reiki. I will most likely also seek a copper bracelet containing black kyanite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this lengthy post. I hope that is has helped you or given you insight in some way.

Depression seems to be at an all time high during this period so I just wanted to share some helpful hints that always seem to help keep me in an upbeat mood. \nGiving tree- I\u2019ve found that the best way to keep my spirits up is to give back and help others. Shopping for someone and knowing that your making a difference in their day really puts a smile on my face. It helps to know that even if im not feeling very important when that person receives their gifts they\u2019ll know that someone out there cared enough.\n Xmas cards- I personally have always been a fan of pen pals and sending and receiving letters and cards in the mail. Nothing brightens my day more than knowing someone took the time to sit down and let me know they were thinking of me. It\u2019s always a mini adventure to know that in a few days someone\u2019s day will be brightened by something as small as a card in the mail. Decorating- Surround yourself with the change you wish to see. It\u2019s hard to feel in the spirit of anything when depression is lurking in the corner. Even if you don\u2019t feel like it decorate a small space in your home. Just having something positive and uplifting to look at will do wonders. \nMusic- Some of you may be sick of all the xmas music ( and with it starting before thanksgiving I don\u2019t blame you!) but just listening to a few of your favorite tunes and belting them out while you do something else like cleaning can really help put a bounce in your step. \nBaking- Not all of us like to cook or bake. If your like me you love to but dont like keeping a lot of sugar and sweets in the house. If your on a tight budget nothing makes a better sweeter gift than something home made. A few chocolate chip cookies or chocolate dipped pretzels wrapped up nice is a great way to let someone know your thinking of them and all the work will help keep your mind busy. \nXmas lights- I know it\u2019s super cold for most of you out there and the thought of taking a walk to look at xmas lights is a bit far fetched but maybe there\u2019s a park near you that has a xmas light display or you can drive around and look at them. Either way your out of the house and away from temptation. \nTime with friends- Nothing is more fun than a little holiday tradition. Wether it\u2019s watching a favorite film or just hanging out i\u2019ve found that if I have something to look forward to it makes the days go by easier. It also makes saying no to those urges easier as well.\n Xmas movies- I like to watch movies at night before bed. I\u2019ve found that if im busy watching a movie a few times a week then going to bed afterwards I dont really have time to dwell on negative thoughts or really act upon them.\n And lastly my favorite, hot cocoa- sometimes you just need to treat yourself a nice hot holiday beverage is just the way.

We&amp;#39;ve talked about what happened before. She just sees me as a friend and I want to see her the same way. And I try. But part of me can&amp;#39;t let go.

The best way to describe it is a clock that&amp;#39;s counting down. I can pause the countdown for a few seconds, but it will always start back up. It&amp;#39;s inevitable. And that brings it back to the point of why even bother anymore. I&amp;#39;ve talked about it with her but I feel like I can&amp;#39;t. She&amp;#39;s having mental issues of her own and I don&amp;#39;t want to tell her about this stuff, especially since it directly involves her.

My grandad is going through his third round with cancer, and I don't know where my life is headed. Once he passes, I'll lose the last person I really have left. I'm not even really over my grandmother's death and that was six years ago. I'm in a really bad place right now.

I haven&amp;#39;t spoken all day to my boyfriend. When we drove home, he kept making noises. I am easily irritated by noises and he knows this. But I can&amp;#39;t speak so I held it in. I put earplugs in to try to save my sanity. But don&amp;#39;t you know that any time I value my own mental health and do something that increases my happiness, I am a selfish piece of shit for not caring more about how it would make HIM feel that I put in earplugs? Even though I know I need them to stay sane, he doesn&amp;#39;t care. Nobody cares about anything but themselves. I&amp;#39;m sick of it. So he slammed the door and it was so loud it physically hurt my ears. I screamed involuntarily because the door slam terrified me. I have sensory issues and loud noises really upset me. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but scream. So he, screamed back at me, &amp;quot;WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED&amp;quot; in this horrible, enraged, judgmental voice. A few minutes later, we were downstairs. He put his phone near me so I gently moved it away from it. It was a light, gentle toss. I don&amp;#39;t like when objects are near me on the bed so I simply tossed it to another location on the bed... nowhere near hard enough to hurt the phone, and it was still in his reach. He grumbled at me and I couldn&amp;#39;t hear it all because I am wearing earplugs but I know he said something along the lines of, &amp;quot;it wasn&amp;#39;t even doing anything to you&amp;quot;. Why does that matter? Am I forced to sit right by a phone? Who is harmed when I move it away? WHY CAN&amp;#39;T I JUST LIVE THE WAY THAT MAKES ME COMFORTABLE??? I AM NOT HARMING ANYONE SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. I cut myself after he said that. I will not forgive him.\n*/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi, my therapist knows about my cutting but I still can&amp;#39;t stop or even temper the increase in severity and frequency. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The urge is too strong. Whenever I feel the urge to cut, it feels like the very ground beneath my feet is shaky and about to give way. It feels like the world is infinitely hopeless and negative and my anger/frustration/depression spirals out of control. It must be some positive feedback mechanism in my brain or something. My cutting feels like a desperate grasping at straws, trying to regain the slightest bit of control over my life. &amp;quot;See, world, you can&amp;#39;t destroy me! I destroy myself! Fuck you!&amp;quot; those kinds of thoughts. I don&amp;#39;t believe any of this stuff intellectually, but the emotions do not listen to reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at school and have class in 1/2 hour. I have been cutting in more noticeable places so I will have to wear a sweatshirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels like I have divided into two people. One is desperately trying to create a better life. She loves art, music, science, and nature. She used to create beautiful and cool things. She used to be funny too. She just wants nothing but the best for everyone and a long, fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other one is opposite. She is fueled by rage and composed only of frustration and bitterness. She is not exactly evil, but she is fed up with everything and basically lashing out at the world for being a bad place. She feels like a super villain whose motivation for evil deeds is a deep, uncompromising pain. She hates everyone, especially the Good Me. She will do things that Good Me specifically doesn&amp;#39;t want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I cut on a noticeable place, because Bad Me wanted to punish Good Me for spilling beer on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend is another trigger. I started crying last night, and felt suicidal so I made the handgun against my head gesture. (Like it looks like your hand is a gun being held to your head.) This was after an entire day of holding in and suppressing my suicidal thoughts, and after being ignored while sobbing in the same room he played on his fucking ipad. I know better than to tell people because when you tell them, they think you are doing it for attention and it makes them hate you so so so much. I dare not purposely disrupt another&amp;#39;s day with my mental health. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I guess the handgun thing was enough to upset him, in spite of the fact that I wanted to do much worse. Like actually kill myself. But he doesn&amp;#39;t care. He just said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not a psychiatrist. I can&amp;#39;t deal with this.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I cut myself again. Partly because of frustration that I have literally no support in my life and am literally NEVER LISTENED TO IN THE SLIGHTEST, and partly out of guilt for letting my disorder harm another person. I cut for the second or third time that day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was hurt and wanted to be alone, so I went on a walk. He followed me, begging me not to. He has no reason to not let me go on a walk. We live in what might be the safest place on earth and it was only 10 PM. I am 29 years old. I deserve and have the right to go on a walk whenever I feel like it, and I am not a bad person for choosing to go on a walk when my boyfriend prefers I stay home for some unknowable reason. Whether or not the people in my life want to accept this fact, I am autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, he followed me. For some reason he was not wearing shoes...? He used that as an excuse to get me to come back. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna get blisters if you don&amp;#39;t turn around. I&amp;#39;m gonna keep following you until you come home.&amp;quot; What a manipulative shitty thing to do--it is not MY fault you chose to chase me in the dark, when I wanted time alone, and it is DEFINITELY NOT MY FUCKING FAULT YOU DIDN&amp;#39;T TAKE 1 MINUTE TO PUT ON SHOES. If he was worried he couldn&amp;#39;t catch up to me, he could have easily taken the car as I was visible from the street during my walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept following me, so I gave him the finger and walked faster. All I wanted was the slightest bit of agency in my life. I am not a child. I need control over my life, as most adults do, in order to be happy and feel respected. But like all of my needs, this one is ignored and I am blamed for daring to even HAVE needs. &amp;quot;Why can&amp;#39;t you just be happy without any of your problems being fixed?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point I desperately ran into a group of trees to shake him. He followed. I sat on a drain, enjoying the sound of rushing water blocking his accusatory, scolding, guilt tripping voice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This morning he asked me to look at his feet. They are covered in red, blood filled blisters. I felt guilty about it in spite of the fact that it was not my fault... and cut myself again. Right before leaving for school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is here with me now. We go to the same school. He is my biggest trigger but I can&amp;#39;t leave. The best I can do is stay silent like I have since yesterday. I will not speak again to anyone in my life. Why should I be emotionally available to others when they do nothing but hurt me? Why give them the gift of joking around, hanging out, encouragement, love, etc... all these things that I do because I want to help others.... but I will not be doing any of these things again until I feel like they treat me as more than an annoying obstacle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no love for me so I must dissolve into nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "/**\nEdit: I just cut again today (the day after posting this).

About six months ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Instead of taking the pills that I was prescribed, though, I instead chose other outlets. One of those outlets was self harm. About three times a week, or whenever I felt especially down, I&amp;#39;d self harm. I won&amp;#39;t go into great detail, because that&amp;#39;s not what this story is about. That being said, I eventually did (with the help of many, many, supportive people) manage to eventually ween myself away from self harm. I had not felt the urge to self harm (or decompression for that matter) for a considerable amount of time. Self harm is though, a terrible poison, one that can stay in your system for days, weeks, months, even years, waiting in a dormant state to reveal itself at just the right time. For me that right (or perhaps more accurately wrong) time was yesterday evening. I was invited to watch my cousin play in her volleyball tournament. So, at 4:45 am, I was off to a giant volleyball center in the middle of Ohio. I didn&amp;#39;t really expect anything to happen unusually that day, but of course it did (I hope your still with me at this point, as I&amp;#39;ll be getting to the point shortly). The rest of the team was all there around 5:00, and I immediately noticed the most beautiful girl I&amp;#39;d ever seen. She was No. 17 on my cousins team, and all I knew about her was her name was Gwen. I may have looked as if I was cheering for my cousin all day, but really I was trying to work up the nerve to talk to Gwen. All day I practiced my lines, fixed my hair in the bathroom mirror, and even watched a couple corny &amp;quot;How to:&amp;quot; videos on YouTube. At the end of the day, after a solid 14 hours of being in a freezing volleyball gym and watching my Prime Numbered Beauty from a distance, I got up to talk to her. About to seconds before I approached her, though, I changed my mind. I, instead kept walking, and pretended that I didn&amp;#39;t hate myself for chickening out, and walked to the car. My uncle dropped me off at home at I went directly to my room. This is where the struggle happens, so rightfully so --TRIGGER WARNING-- I got my knife and I held it against my right forearm. I had a million thoughts pouring throughout my mind. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a failure.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a good thing you didn&amp;#39;t talk to her, she deserves better.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What a loser.&amp;quot; etc. etc. One fateful thought crept into my mind though, and out shined the others. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been clean for six months, why stop now?&amp;quot; I thought about this over and over in my mind, &amp;quot;Why stop now?&amp;quot; As I lowered the knife from my wrist, I had already knew I won. Temporarily, at least. There are a couple things I want you to get from this story. The first is &amp;quot;Why stop now?&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t care if you&amp;#39;ve been clean for a day or a year, if you ever get the thoughts we&amp;#39;ve all had, think to yourself, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve managed to make it this long, let&amp;#39;s try a little longer.&amp;quot; If you can push yourself a little longer, even if you relapse, next time you&amp;#39;ll be able to go longer, and longer. The next thing I want you to get from this post is to think. If I hadn&amp;#39;t thought that thought at that moment, I would have done it, and I would be in a much worse place now. So please, please, always think. The last thing isn&amp;#39;t necessarily for self harm, more just words to live by. Never, ever let a complement go unsaid, ever. I don&amp;#39;t care how embarrassed you may be by telling someone how you feel, even if you just met them, you could quite literally change their lives. I know this was poorly written, but I hope you got the main points.

Whereas if you do self-harm with the butterfly there; you will have to wash it off. If that does happen, you can start again by drawing a new one on. You can name the butterfly after someone you love, or have a loved one draw it for you.\nWrite the name of a loved one [a friend, family member, or anyone else who cares about you] and write their name where you want to self harm. When you go to self harm remember how much they care and wouldn&amp;#39;t want you to harm yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about what you would say to a friend who was struggling with the same things you are and try to be a good friend to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make a bracelet out duct tape, and put a line on it every day (Or any period of time) you go without self harm.

We became really close friend really fast because our personalities really clicked. All of us are gamers and usually play and talk every day, but she lives in another state so I&amp;#39;ve never met her in person. Leah has had a long distance relationship for about a year with Matt, who is a college student in New Zealand. Because of the time zone difference, they can&amp;#39;t talk much so they talk through skype messages or video chat at like 3 am. However, Leah has low self-confidence and anxiety, so she is often concerned that she is annoying or a shitty girlfriend for Matt. Whenever Matt doesn&amp;#39;t respond to her within a day or two, she either gets super worried about him or thinks that he doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to her anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So about a month and a half ago, Chris and Leah had a private chat because Leah was having thoughts about cutting herself. I knew they had a private chat, but they lied about what they talked about when I asked Chris later. Last night, our main squad were talking on our voip server and one of the topics that came up was Leah&amp;#39;s relationship with Matt. Matt had gotten drunk the night before and revealed to Leah that Matt&amp;#39;s brother had died in a drug deal gone wrong long before he met Leah. Apparently Matt&amp;#39;s bother was shot twice and Matt held him in his arms as he died. He became really depressed and cut himself as a result (which he no longer does, according to Leah). When Leah told this to us last night, I told her it didn&amp;#39;t make sense that Matt would cut himself. I explained to everyone the science behind what happens when you cut yourself and why it didn&amp;#39;t make sense unless Matt felt that he was to blame for his brother&amp;#39;s death. After we all got off for the night, Leah cried for an hour and cut herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She confided this with Chris this morning, presumably because Chris had also cut himself many years ago. She told him that she thinks that she\u2019s &amp;quot;a fucking awful girlfriend and can&amp;#39;t do anything right&amp;quot; which is why she cried and cut herself. The worst part is that she said it worked, and she thinks she wants to do it again. Our talk where I explained cutting last night probably set her down that path, but there wasn&amp;#39;t really a way I could have known that was something she considered. Anyways, right before Matt met Leah, he was in an emotionally abusive relationship, and it feels like he is using Leah as a fuck buddy and a way to forget about his ex. Leah said she believes this to be true, but doesn&amp;#39;t care because she genuinely loves him and just wants to be the best possible girlfriend because she just wants him to be happy. To put this in perspective, for Christmas she spent $100 to send him a box full of American snacks, candies, love notes, and some clothing she knit for him. However, he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to reciprocate nearly as much affection or attention as Leah gives to him. Whenever Matt does compliment her, she tells me and is absolutely glowing with happiness. However, those moments are far and few in between, so a result she is in constant self-doubt and hates herself. From what Leah tells me, Matt doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a bad guy but he just doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a good match for what Leah needs in a relationship. Because Chris and I have been best friends for about 15 years, we share pretty much everything and this morning he told me the truth about their private conversation a month ago and that Leah cut herself despite Leah&amp;#39;s wishes to keep it private. Since she is one of my closest friends, I&amp;#39;m naturally concerned about it and want to help her. However, when I subtly probed this afternoon to see if she would tell me herself, she didn&amp;#39;t. This is where my predicament is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as of right now, Leah doesn&amp;#39;t know that Chris told me about the cutting and she doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want me to know. However, she has told me pretty much everything about her relationship with Matt. It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that Chris and I have suggested for a while that she end things with Matt for her own emotional wellbeing, but she really, really doesn&amp;#39;t want to break up. I&amp;#39;ve looked up ways to help Leah, but because of our distance and Leah not wanting me to know, most of the suggestions I&amp;#39;ve read aren&amp;#39;t really possible, although finding an alternative to cutting seems like a pretty good idea. I&amp;#39;ve also considered bringing Matt into this (AFAIK he doesn&amp;#39;t know) and trying to get him to be more affectionate/attentive to Leah, but finding a way to contact him without Leah knowing would be hard.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated, but I&amp;#39;d prefer to maintain the status quo unless absolutely necessary, so any advice you give will probably have to be relayed through Chris. Thanks for all your help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Apologies for the wall of text, but I'll start with the background info in case it helps anyone.

Furthermore, participants will receive an extra $5 if they complete the questionnaires on at least 6 out of 7 days, for each week. Therefore, participants will receive between $20 and $30 in part 2 of this study, and a total of $30 to $40 as appreciation for completing the entire study. Additionally, telling us about your experiences will give us important information on what leads to self-injury on a day-to-day basis, and could help develop and improve treatments for people who want to stop self-injuring.
