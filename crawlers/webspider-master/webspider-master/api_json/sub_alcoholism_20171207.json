We knew something wasn&amp;#39;t right so I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time in my life (I&amp;#39;m 28 years old) and was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. I&amp;#39;ve been here for 95 days and the other day my parents found the empty pints of alcohol I had been hiding in my room. They&amp;#39;ve both seen my uncle suffer through addiction and they don&amp;#39;t like drinking so I would sneak the alcohol in in my purse and then be too scared to throw it away because they love to snoop (I also hide slim jims from then because my mom freaks out at processed snacks like that, so hiding habits from my parents isn&amp;#39;t anything new). The other day they found 12 empty pints in my chest and tried insisting I go to an inpatient treatment center. When I refused we compromised on intensive outpatient but I still don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s necessary and, in fact, may actually be counter-productive because it means that I can&amp;#39;t see my psychiatrist (I had been seeing him weekly) who is the only person that has ever actually helped me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t drinking because I was depressed and I wasn&amp;#39;t drinking because I was trying to numb the pain from my assault and depression - I was really honestly just doing it because I was bored and I&amp;#39;ve always liked alcohol. My whole life is back in Maryland including my SO of four years, my friends, and the small handmade soap company that my SO and I founded and run. In Ohio I have no friends, a menial part-time job, and my parents. There&amp;#39;s only so much I can do for the soap company here and I miss it almost as much as I miss my boyfriend. I&amp;#39;m not used to not being busy and I&amp;#39;ve taken up painting again but it&amp;#39;s not as fulfilling as running a small business.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I was diagnosed with BP in September I made the decision to stay here for four months. Mainly because I figured two months to recover from the assault (I&amp;#39;m also seeing a trauma therapist) and get my meds right, and then I may as well stay for Thanksgiving and Christmas instead of having to travel back and forth. The plan was to return to Maryland after Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel very frustrated with my parents right now. My father is a psychologist and in high school I told him I was depressed, in college I told him I was feeling depressed, after college I told him I was feeling depressed. My parents responded by (respectively) accusing me of making excuses for not wanting to study, telling me it was just because of the weather, and telling me to take vitamin D supplements and St. John&amp;#39;s wort (did I mention my father is a psychologist?). Meanwhile, in High School when they found weed in my room they sent me to a substance abuse counselor immediately. It took a dimebag to get me to a substance abuse counselor and a full on manic episode after 12 years of intermittent depression to get me to a psychiatrist.

We knew something wasn't right so I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time in my life (I'm 28 years old) and was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. I've been here for 95 days and the other day my parents found the empty pints of alcohol I had been hiding in my room. They've both seen my uncle suffer through addiction and they don't like drinking so I would sneak the alcohol in in my purse and then be too scared to throw it away because they love to snoop (I also hide slim jims from then because my mom freaks out at processed snacks like that, so hiding habits from my parents isn't anything new). The other day they found 12 empty pints in my chest and tried insisting I go to an inpatient treatment center. When I refused we compromised on intensive outpatient but I still don't feel like it's necessary and, in fact, may actually be counter-productive because it means that I can't see my psychiatrist (I had been seeing him weekly) who is the only person that has ever actually helped me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wasn't drinking because I was depressed and I wasn't drinking because I was trying to numb the pain from my assault and depression - I was really honestly just doing it because I was bored and I've always liked alcohol. My whole life is back in Maryland including my SO of four years, my friends, and the small handmade soap company that my SO and I founded and run. In Ohio I have no friends, a menial part-time job, and my parents. There's only so much I can do for the soap company here and I miss it almost as much as I miss my boyfriend. I'm not used to not being busy and I've taken up painting again but it's not as fulfilling as running a small business.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter I was diagnosed with BP in September I made the decision to stay here for four months. Mainly because I figured two months to recover from the assault (I'm also seeing a trauma therapist) and get my meds right, and then I may as well stay for Thanksgiving and Christmas instead of having to travel back and forth. The plan was to return to Maryland after Christmas. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI honestly feel very frustrated with my parents right now. My father is a psychologist and in high school I told him I was depressed, in college I told him I was feeling depressed, after college I told him I was feeling depressed. My parents responded by (respectively) accusing me of making excuses for not wanting to study, telling me it was just because of the weather, and telling me to take vitamin D supplements and St. John's wort (did I mention my father is a psychologist?). Meanwhile, in High School when they found weed in my room they sent me to a substance abuse counselor immediately. It took a dimebag to get me to a substance abuse counselor and a full on manic episode after 12 years of intermittent depression to get me to a psychiatrist. Now they're taking me away from my psychiatrist to get me substance abuse counseling again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSorry about the rant, this post really got away from me. \n\n**TL;DR** Was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, parents found 12 empty pints in my room over a 90 day period, insisting I stop seeing my psychiatrist and go to an intensive outpatient program for substance abuse.

Ive been drinking since 19. Not everday at first but after my 21st birthday it was everyday. Sometimes a 30 pack or maybe a bottle of Jack, or boxed wine. We all know the old, lets catch another buzz today, it will be fine! \nWell this Thanksgiving I went on a bender like no other. Well about 2 months before Thanksgiving is when it started. Drinking at work, a beer on the bus ride home. Going down with homeless people and getting them drunk. Really wild stuff. Riding around and just drinking non stop beer out of my bookbag sometimes. Shotgunning beers in the middle of crosswalks, like literally I wouldnt be able to wait til the other side of the crosswalk. Well, fast forward the night after Thanksgiving. Friday night. I drank a bottle of rum and some wine, woke up Saturday and polished off the boxed wine. Had another boxed wine that night. I came to a sudden realization that this was not healthy for me. I was crying watching sad youtube videos and asked my girlfriend to pour out the rest of the boxed wine, I watched about 3/4s of a bag of wine go down the drain. Ok sweet. I kissed my girl and went upstairs. I fell asleep. This is where the real fun begins. I wake up, fuzzy, heart rate and blood pressure were sky rocketed! I hop in the shower, its nice and warm. Very comforting. Boy was I in for a trip. I get out and hear my name. I dry off and go back to my room, my girl is fast asleep. I wake up her and ask her what. She says, are you ok? I say yes Im fine. Then I notice she is still sleeping. I start to back up and my vision gets real bad. She wasn&amp;#39;t even in the bed she had went to go look at an apartment. I start to think Im in a dream. I pinch myself. It hurts. Ok I&amp;#39;m awake. I chug water and slap myself about 100 times before chilling out a bit. I go into the room and put on some youtube. Im shaking, sweating, convulsing, and crying. I have no control over my body at some points. I keep thinking about my girl. I try to slow my heartbeat by breathing exercises. Not happening. Thinking Im still wet from the shower I dont really notice how much Im actually sweating. I mean a puddle on my chest every 3 to 4 mins. I keep wiping it. It returns. This goes on for about 2 hours. I never even noticed that my girlfriend has returned as she was only gone for about 30 minutes. She was the one wiping my chest. I thought it was my hands. Im in an out of conscious like Ive drank already. Nope, confirmed no alcohol that day. So now its nighttime on Sunday, apparently I was awake and just watching youtube on autoplay. My girl constantly checks my pulse to make sure my heart doesnt stop. We are only a few blocks from the hospital. Apparently I didnt want the ambulance to be called unless my heart stopped. At this point, Im barely coming to. I search on my phone to find out that this is alcohol dts. Delerium Tremors from alcohol withdrawal. Im freaked at this point. I still hold off the urge to drink regardless if it says I have to taper off. I go in the bathroom every few minutes and splash water on my face. I tell myself if Im going to die then I deserve it. I go through about 5 water bottles an hour. I know that I have to atleast keep something in my stomach to not dehydrate. I go in the bathroom one last time, then I lay down for bed. Every time I close my eyes I hear weird things. Open my eyes every few seconds and prepare to pass away. I close my eyes to see and hear vivid hallucinations of me at job thinking its real. Weird stuff like, somebody buying a washer off me. Open my eyes then another scenerio of me being at a bar drinking and laughing with old friends. Open my eyes. Close my eyes. Different scenerios throughout the night, goes on til about Monday at 6 fall asleep, for the few hours I was asleep I controlled my dreams, like lucid dreaming but better. I had to be up at 9 for work, I get up still sweating. Let it be known that I sweated the entire 72 hours of this experience. Plus all day at work Monday. Like went through over 4 cases of 24 bottled waters in that time in this time frame. I get off work Monday, sweats die down. I go to the grocery store with my girl. Sweats have subsided. I get a few things head home and eat tacos for dinner. Which leads me to right here and now. Its a bit past midnight. Alcohol Withdrawal is no joke, I see now that I should of called for medical after or before my shower. I seen things that werent there. Heard things that were not there. Sweated right up until about 5 hours ago. Was hot then cold every 30 to 45 seconds. Basically dying without knowing it. This shitty drug we call alcohol is not for me anymore. DO NOT GO COLD TURKEY EVER! Either taper or go to the ER they will help. The worse has passed for my ladies and gentleman. Ive made it through but my struggle is just beginning. I bought a case of glass bottled soda and Im sticking to that. They helped with the cravings tonight. Im no longer sweating. Im no longer nauseated at the sight of food. I can feel again. Im no longer hallcinating or hearing things. Im alive again. After close to 8 years of drinking. Its over. If you are reading this chances are you have or are experiencing or going to experience these things. Please trust me when I say, this will not be fun and will be life threatening. Get medical help when quitting drinking do not go cold turkey! Im ready to be sober, I called my doctor and he said that the unconsciousness was my heart preparing itself to start shutting off vital organs.

When we first started dating, we would go out a lot and drink, but to me we were just having fun, so I did not pay any attention to the amount of alcohol he was able consume in one night. It took me about six month to realize that he might have a drinking problem. The first sign was the fact that whenever he was supposed to meet me somewhere, he wouldn&amp;#39;t show up or show up hours later drunk. Or he would call me that he&amp;#39;s already on his way, but he was really still at home drinking. One time I got sick of waiting, so I marched up to his place only to find him passed out on the bed surrounded by empty beer bottles, which was a huge shock, but once again, I am so stupid I didn&amp;#39;t pay as much attention to it as I probably should have.

It took me about six month to realize that he might have a drinking problem. The first sign was the fact that whenever he was supposed to meet me somewhere, he wouldn't show up or show up hours later drunk. Or he would call me that he's already on his way, but he was really still at home drinking. One time I got sick of waiting, so I marched up to his place only to find him passed out on the bed surrounded by empty beer bottles, which was a huge shock, but once again, I am so stupid I didn't pay as much attention to it as I probably should have.

Plus I budget my paycheck around being able to drink consistently. My problem is when im drinking I am happy as can be, then I get trashed and get suicidal tendencies sometimes. Then I head to work, drink water all day, portion my meals so I can have the proper calorie intake to drink a lot so I dont gain too much weight. It is out of control honestly. \n\nNow, here is my question. The idea of quitting all together is almost terrifying, because I absolutely love alcohol. I need help, but I cant just drink a few. I need to get drunk every single time. \nWhen did you decide it was enough? How do you take that first step? Should I attend AA? What about my fear of immediately relapsing. Will my happiness go away when I stop? \n\nAny advice is much appreciated. Im not sure who else to ask. Thanks. \n\nEdit: Every comment on here is very encouraging. Every perspective and advice that ya'll are saying is eye opening. Thank you everyone.

We have had numerous conversations and pleas to take responsibility for this action but he does not take them seriously, his justification is literally that he thinks he is a good driver when drunk. \n\nWe are a little lost in what to do about this, and beyond the factor of wanting healthy decisions for a loved one, my family and I are having a real tough time with the guilt of knowingly letting happen and If he hurts another person. Furthermore we think he is putting my mom and his financial future at risk. Parents have zero retirement, all went towards land. That was the plan. Afraid he will do something to someone else that ends with him losing the farm. \n\nWe have consider \u201cturning him in\u201d to authorities but we worry that will end poorly as well. Both mentally and finically given his career. \n\nAny suggestions would be helpful. We just want to figure out a way that is good for him but gets him off the roads.   \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7e90ra", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Looking for suggestions for parent who is driving daily", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 15, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7e90ra", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/7e90ra/looking_for_suggestions_for_parent_who_is_driving/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1511215133.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/7e90ra/looking_for_suggestions_for_parent_who_is_driving/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "beatthebeetles", "created_utc": 1511186333.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Aunt recently moved back to her moms after losing her house due to her drinking.

I don\u2019t necessarily identify myself as a polymath because most people I have heard the term used in reference with have several doctorate titles streaming at the end of their name. Though I never chose a true focus in college I probably don\u2019t have enough under my belt to be in PhD contention if I did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I digress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question recently occurred to me, as I realized that now in my late twenties I have become a habitual drinker, that I should figure out my exact alcohol intake, and that that data set should be relatively uniform without much deviation, as I tend towards the same amount daily and don\u2019t really binge drink on the weekends (if anything, being completely transparent, there\u2019s a small spike on Friday and I actually don\u2019t drink as much during the weekend). \nSo I took the alcohol content of what I drink and how much in an average week and took the full volume of those drinks and calculated my actual volume of pure alcohol intake per day from the sum of those drink volumes and their stated percentages. Pretty much with little variation I drink 2.7 ounces of pure alcohol per day at this point in my life. When I was a younger adult I tended to binge drink and avoid drinking at all during the week. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my question is: Is this daily volume considered excessive or moderate? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve always considered myself a moderate drinker, but in questioning it I find that most sources out there don\u2019t really get specific on the exact alcohol content they find to be too much. Most resources tell me I\u2019m at the high end of moderate, and before I get the \u201cif you feel like it\u2019s excessive it probably is\u201d responses, I always stop when there is still booze in the cabinet and the reason the question even occurred to me is because I\u2019ve always felt the need to keep going to a certain point before I stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Alright guys. After I posted I went through your community guidelines page in more depth. I took the tests honestly, really thought about how I conduct myself day to day, and found that I probably have mild AUD.

I don\u2019t necessarily identify myself as a polymath because most people I have heard the term used in reference with have several doctorate titles streaming at the end of their name. Though I never chose a true focus in college I probably don\u2019t have enough under my belt to be in PhD contention if I did. \n\nBut I digress. \n\nThe question recently occurred to me, as I realized that now in my late twenties I have become a habitual drinker, that I should figure out my exact alcohol intake, and that that data set should be relatively uniform without much deviation, as I tend towards the same amount daily and don\u2019t really binge drink on the weekends (if anything, being completely transparent, there\u2019s a small spike on Friday and I actually don\u2019t drink as much during the weekend). \nSo I took the alcohol content of what I drink and how much in an average week and took the full volume of those drinks and calculated my actual volume of pure alcohol intake per day from the sum of those drink volumes and their stated percentages. Pretty much with little variation I drink 2.7 ounces of pure alcohol per day at this point in my life. When I was a younger adult I tended to binge drink and avoid drinking at all during the week. \n\nNow my question is: Is this daily volume considered excessive or moderate? \n\nI\u2019ve always considered myself a moderate drinker, but in questioning it I find that most sources out there don\u2019t really get specific on the exact alcohol content they find to be too much. Most resources tell me I\u2019m at the high end of moderate, and before I get the \u201cif you feel like it\u2019s excessive it probably is\u201d responses, I always stop when there is still booze in the cabinet and the reason the question even occurred to me is because I\u2019ve always felt the need to keep going to a certain point before I stop. \n\nThank you in advance for your thoughts. \n\n\nEdit: Alright guys. After I posted I went through your community guidelines page in more depth. I took the tests honestly, really thought about how I conduct myself day to day, and found that I probably have mild AUD. I\u2019m going to start the process of climbing down from the fence toward the healthier side. I don\u2019t ever want to get to the place where people start throwing around the phrase \u201cfunctioning alcoholic\u201d to justify my habits, so I\u2019m going to quit while I\u2019m ahead. \n\nPlease don\u2019t let me forget about this.

Background: A family member of mine has been an alcoholic since probably 2007-2008. At the beginning of their addiction they went to multiple rehab facilities as well as attending meetings semi-regularly. But neither of those really seemed to help said family member overcome the addiction. These past 7-8 years they have been in and out of jobs due to wasting their money on alcohol as soon as they get their paycheck and not being able to work then ultimately being let go for failure to show up to work. This has happened recently too with multiple jobs and now I am just at a loss to help. They will work for about a month, lose the job, and wait another 5-6 months to land another job, it seems like the same cycle over and over.    For reference, I am 21 years old. I obviously care about this person very much but I am at a point where I don&amp;#39;t even think it is beneficial to care about their work life. When they aren&amp;#39;t working, they are at the house doing nothing and sober, which is nice obviously. But then they aren&amp;#39;t supporting the family. Is it ok to not care about their work life anymore so it stops bringing me down? I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore and am looking for some guidance. My opinion on the matter is that I should stop caring about the whole work situation but it&amp;#39;s so hard to let go. And when this happens every time, I usually am pretty rough on them. But they never seem to listen to me when they get a job and I tell them the money has to go towards the family.

I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d be considered an &amp;quot;alcoholic&amp;quot; by any standard, but I am looking for perspectives on how to evaluate my drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, I&amp;#39;m in my early 30s and have high functioning autism (Asperger&amp;#39;s). Primarily because of social challenges, I did not actually start drinking until my late 20s. About 3-4 years ago, a friend brought me to a social club, which has helped my social side and also got me into being a social drinker. I rarely drink alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few incidents in recent months have made me question whether I have the early stages of a problem. I will occasionally (once every 2-3 months) have a night where I get emotionally upset about something and get drunk as a response. Once did lead to a blackout, in which I don&amp;#39;t remember leaving the bar I was at and going back to my room (it was out of town, so the bar was just a walk across the street from the hotel). A few weeks ago, a friend let me crash on his couch (he has offered it as an open invite anytime I don&amp;#39;t think I should drive), and I woke up in the morning to discover I had pissed myself in my sleep.

I don't think I'd be considered an \"alcoholic\" by any standard, but I am looking for perspectives on how to evaluate my drinking.\n\nFor a bit of background, I'm in my early 30s and have high functioning autism (Asperger's). Primarily because of social challenges, I did not actually start drinking until my late 20s. About 3-4 years ago, a friend brought me to a social club, which has helped my social side and also got me into being a social drinker. I rarely drink alone.\n\nA few incidents in recent months have made me question whether I have the early stages of a problem. I will occasionally (once every 2-3 months) have a night where I get emotionally upset about something and get drunk as a response. Once did lead to a blackout, in which I don't remember leaving the bar I was at and going back to my room (it was out of town, so the bar was just a walk across the street from the hotel). A few weeks ago, a friend let me crash on his couch (he has offered it as an open invite anytime I don't think I should drive), and I woke up in the morning to discover I had pissed myself in my sleep.

Again - I did not enter relationships just because of a drunk evening - all my past girlfriends I knew well before the first kiss. I have many female friends. We talk to one another normally, but I am just extremely scared of talking about relationships, touching them or getting closer when sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am very shy.

Obviously no secret that alcohol at that quantity does a number on your body. He has said a few times that he can&amp;#39;t eat because it makes him sick. Any insight on this would be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has been hospitalized for tremors and a year ago he didn&amp;#39;t drink for a few weeks and immediately went into convulsions and had to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After he got evicted he was back home with his parents for a short bit and then returned. I&amp;#39;m not sure if they helped him get a new place or what. But he&amp;#39;s sort of hinted at he&amp;#39;s not drinking (maybe they won&amp;#39;t pay rent?) or at least not drinking much (maybe sneaking sips in occasionally?). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s also said that he&amp;#39;s having a psychological break down and has been hospitalized 5 times this week. Could excessive drinking and health problems for years and then cut down or off cause mental faculties to go down? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said he has 2 aa sponsors and he tried really hard to go to a meeting but went out and got lost and also lost his id and money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;#39;s said repeatedly that he is dying and doesn&amp;#39;t want to. I asked what he meant and he told me the part about getting lost yesterday. He&amp;#39;s definitely not talking about suicide - it sounds like he believes this is the end of his life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am at loss for words and just heartbroken over anyone going through that, let alone an old friend. I know if you&amp;#39;re in this group you probably have plenty of experience in either side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty clear to me that he needs serious medical attention, therapy, and rehabilitation. I don&amp;#39;t even know where he is really so nothing I can do there. But I&amp;#39;m very much interested in any insight, stories, information you might have if you&amp;#39;ve been through something at this level. I&amp;#39;m just trying to understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also how can I best support and help from a distance? Is there any service/group that I should know about? Or contact? Is there any credibility to his idea that he&amp;#39;s dying or is this delusion? Tips for getting back in to eating food?

But he's sort of hinted at he's not drinking (maybe they won't pay rent?) or at least not drinking much (maybe sneaking sips in occasionally?). \n\nAnd he's also said that he's having a psychological break down and has been hospitalized 5 times this week. Could excessive drinking and health problems for years and then cut down or off cause mental faculties to go down? \n\nHe said he has 2 aa sponsors and he tried really hard to go to a meeting but went out and got lost and also lost his id and money. \n\nAnd he's said repeatedly that he is dying and doesn't want to. I asked what he meant and he told me the part about getting lost yesterday. He's definitely not talking about suicide - it sounds like he believes this is the end of his life. \n\nAnyway, I am at loss for words and just heartbroken over anyone going through that, let alone an old friend. I know if you're in this group you probably have plenty of experience in either side. \n\nIt's pretty clear to me that he needs serious medical attention, therapy, and rehabilitation. I don't even know where he is really so nothing I can do there. But I'm very much interested in any insight, stories, information you might have if you've been through something at this level. I'm just trying to understand. \n\nAlso how can I best support and help from a distance? Is there any service/group that I should know about? Or contact? Is there any credibility to his idea that he's dying or is this delusion? Tips for getting back in to eating food? If any one here has had success pulling out of something like this, I'd love to hear about it. \n\nAnything and everything is appreciated.  THANK YOU for listening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7bf7rq", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Need advice and insight on extremely SERIOUS alcoholism effects, medical, psychological, recovery.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7bf7rq", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/7bf7rq/need_advice_and_insight_on_extremely_serious/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1510108808.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/7bf7rq/need_advice_and_insight_on_extremely_serious/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "stuck-in-the-mud", "created_utc": 1510080008.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;okayy so last week i got suspended for being \u201cintoxicated\u201d at school which is dumb because i drank the night before and the school has no evidence of me even drinking. they thought i was drinking alcohol at school for some reason but anyway i told my mom i didn\u2019t drink so she didn\u2019t know what to believe. she took me to the hospital to get drug tested and it came out to \u201c0.01\u201d can they suspended me for that or? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "okayy so last week i got suspended for being \u201cintoxicated\u201d at school which is dumb because i drank the night before and the school has no evidence of me even drinking. they thought i was drinking alcohol at school for some reason but anyway i told my mom i didn\u2019t drink so she didn\u2019t know what to believe. she took me to the hospital to get drug tested and it came out to \u201c0.01\u201d can they suspended me for that or?

My body cannot handle this level of consumption, and I have already learned a million times over that neither can my mind.\n\nThanks, guys.  :/", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7b9bn9", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Time To Seek Medical Treatment?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7b9bn9", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/7b9bn9/time_to_seek_medical_treatment/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1510041732.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/7b9bn9/time_to_seek_medical_treatment/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "holographicbiologist", "created_utc": 1510012932.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Practicing the Eleventh Step, along with reworking all the other Steps, has given me greater integrity and strengthened my sobriety.

I got a pretty damn long story so if you guys are interested I am going to unload all of it in its entirety. But for your sake, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I was an alcoholic right after high school and it was so bad I was homeless, and that still wasn&amp;#39;t enough to get me to quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The beginning of this story i wrote a long time ago so it&amp;#39;s copy pasted here from hellopoetry:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;School was always humuorous to a degree in my opinion because of the underlying idea\nthat the more damaged you were, the cooler you were in the eyes of the rest of the school.\nI have heard numerous conversations that began with something along the lines of, &amp;quot;Oh, you\nthink YOU got it bad, well my dad blah blah and my best friend blah blah and my life is hell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to get a little personal and share with you guys something I have never actually\ntold anyone in entirety yet. I am pretty sure the whole story is still only here in my brain.\nI will, out of respect for these people, change their names.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s October 31, 2012. It&amp;#39;s about noon, and all of us sixteen to twenty-two year olds are just waking up.\nBrianne woke up probably a few hours ago already to tend to her son, Aaron. He is adorable, one\nand a half, blond hair, blue eyes. I have been living here for nearly two months. I am supporting her,\nAaron, and myself with food stamps. I get two hundred dollars a month to basically smoke weed and drink\non the government&amp;#39;s budget. Trust me, I&amp;#39;m not proud of it either, and if I could I would pay it back.\nSince Brianne is a single mother and an adopted child, she has a single-digit monthly rent (I was fucking\nbaffled to hear this) and receives support from her foster parents. Basically, if I want to stay here forever\nwith absolutely no consequences save to miss out on a life of my own, I can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brandon is putting on clown make-up so he can troll the streets as a juggalo. I find this amusing as I always\nliked to mess around with ICP fans, but he&amp;#39;s a really cool kid so I let it go and I even help him perfect it.\nI notice he has a bottle of Stolichnaya in his backpack and it&amp;#39;s practically full. That, to me, is temptation.\nI ask if he would mind me taking a few drinks here and there from the bottle and he says it&amp;#39;s fine, so I proceed\nto get a nice one p.m. buzz. It was always my favorite drunk, very light, and airy, almost like you&amp;#39;re still asleep.\nSomething bogs you down, but it doesn&amp;#39;t bother you, somehow it makes you lighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day, we hook up with a few friends, go out and trick or treat in the pouring rain, get soaked\nand wait for two hours under an overpass while Brianne goes and gets her car. From there, we proceed home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, everyone is over at Breanne&amp;#39;s and we&amp;#39;re all making dinner and drinking beer and having a good time\n(Aaron is with the grandparents tonight). I guess I started getting angry about the recent events (for about a month,\neveryone in our group with the exception of Brandon have been slowly losing items...but they&amp;#39;re obviously being stolen.\nAt a point, a few of us did some research and determined the only person who could possibly have stolen\na good deal of these things has to be Brandon) and I decided I was tired of sitting on the news waiting for no one to make\na move after a solid two weeks of being certain that we had our guy. So I called him out... and proceeded\nto begin burning bridges slowly and very surely for the next few days. I am pretty sure a fight would have broken out\nif Bri hadn&amp;#39;t taken me into her room to relax. When I finally do, it turns out I woke up the upstairs neighbor,\nher baby, and everyone in the house has left save for my friend Jeff and his girlfriend Marissa. This concludes night one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I later learned that Brandon was not actually the person who was stealing from us (unless of course\nhe just happened to not get caught when we found out who had done most of it) and I feel bad for bringing the whole\nthing up because I would have liked to stay in touch with him. We got along swimmingly and he actually did have\na lot of interesting things to talk about. Smart, nice, hilarious... Well, maybe he&amp;#39;ll turn up one day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I woke up to find the house empty save for Jeff and Marissa in the next room, but where I am,\nit simply appears empty. I don&amp;#39;t know what happened but I intuit that I have been sleeping all night without\nmy girlfriend. This upsets me and I begin to weep like a confused child, which is exactly what you do when you&amp;#39;re\nhelpless and too drunk in the brain to figure out how to pull yourself out of a helpless situation (trust me,\nI own the handbook). Marissa walks in and begins to explain to me that I had scared her too much and she slept\non the couch and that she had left to go pick up her son. So I realize I need to calm down, but I can feel\nJeff is not happy with me in the slightest, considering he will not come and talk to me (this is extremely painful\nbecause he is probably one of the best friends I have ever had, with a mind that vastly exceeds that of everyone\nI have met save one other, and he&amp;#39;s a different story). They leave and I decide to stay in the house all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very bad idea. I stay home, watch re-runs of a show I have seen billions of times, and considering\nthat Brandon and I are no longer on good terms, like a complete asshole, I drink the rest of his vodka.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In walks Bri, it&amp;#39;s around 7. She&amp;#39;s not happy. She proceeds to tell me that the night before I asked out a friend of mine\nand she said yes. And I was a bit shocked because I couldn&amp;#39;t remember it at first. Then it all hit me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days before, Aaron called me &amp;quot;dad.&amp;quot; Now remember, this is not my child. I am dark, dark, dark, and she had this kid\nabout two years after we had any past relationship. I am extremely worried in my mind and I realize I am headed toward nothing.\nThat I am stagnant and can not even afford to go back to school. This scares me, so I drunkenly asked out Tanya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tanya...we had been friends for about five years, and I had tried to get with her so many damn times... she was like\none of those girls you see and you&amp;#39;re instantly reminded of an anime character. Tall, thin, beautiful hips, perfect\nproportions, lovely hair, eyes, voice, and a personality I can liken to a Disney princess/black metal lumberjack.\nThe kind of girl who has a tough exterior, but inside, she just wants someone to tell her everything is going to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about two hours of pleading with Bri to let me stay, I finally send Tanya a message, and we hang out for the next\ntwo days, whence I whisper in her ear that everything is going to be okay and we proceed to have quite passionate sex\nfor those nights, where I discovered the secret to making a woman climax with my tongue (tip: if the underside of your\ntongue isn&amp;#39;t completely torn apart, you&amp;#39;re doing something wrong). But alas, I could not stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the part I dreaded, because I know I have to go back to Jeff&amp;#39;s house and ask him if I can stay there for a while.\nAnd I got the answer I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words he used...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pissed off...extremely pissed off at you, and disappointed.&amp;quot; It was like a father saying it to you. And him and I\nhave a very interesting friendship built on such an extreme understanding that I knew exactly how badly I had been spiraling.\nI began to leave and he gave me a slice of pizza, with that slight smile that told me &amp;quot;just go find yourself, we&amp;#39;ll be fine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hobbled off into the night drunk, with one piece of pizza and all my food at Bri&amp;#39;s, which could have lasted me another few days,\neasing the transition into homeless. And it could have prevented a horrible occurance that took place the following afternoon. I\nwas crying, because I knew I was dying, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to ask either of my parents for help, because this was the first time\nI was out on my own and I was far too proud to give up and let the world make me its victim. So I walked...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sixteen fucking miles...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the next town. Took me all night because I was dodging traffic, easing into trees, avoiding on and off ramps, trying to stay\naway from any police that may exist on the road. When I finally arrived in the next town (where I knew I may have one contact)\nI decided to sleep until the morning came so I could have the energy to find my next venture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was five thirty am. I had 3 hours until sun-up, I had just walked enough to be burning, and there was plenty of whiskey in my veins.\nI had left my sleeping bag with Tanya hours earlier, wishing in the park that I had not been so naiive as to think I would be allowed\nback in the house. So I pulled out a pile of dirty clothes and put them over me like blankets, in some random corner of the local\npark, under some bushes, hidden from cold and sight, with great hope...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes pass. My eyes shoot open. I am freezing. The sweat has dried and frozen to my body. This is hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grab my things and with the worst effort I can ever remember myself mustering, I drag myself to the toilet.\nWhen I open it, the first thing I check for is cleanliness. It&amp;#39;s spotless. I am so relieved. I sit in the corner of the room,\nwhich my knees to my chest, head in my hands, wrapped in a leather jacket I had gotten from Jeff (ha, he really is my\nguardian angel, though he would laugh to hear it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I catch winks, occasionally looking up to check if the sun is rising. When it finally is, I get up, change my clothes (I had\nONE clean set of clothing and it had been rotting with the rest in the backpack) and immediately head to a thrift store where\na family friend is working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my way there, I notice in a little parking lot near the store a sight I had never actually come across but I always thought\nwould be the most amazing luck, and it was timed in such a spot in my life that it was the ultimate miracle...and a curse in\ndisguise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In front of my eyes (this miracle appeared in my path as I was walking looking down, so it startled me) was the worst possible thing\nfor me: A half finished fifth of Smirnoff, and a half smoked pack of Marlboro 100 Reds. I open the pack and sure enough, the celophane\nprotected every cigarette inside from any water damage. I am ecstatic. This is not only amazing, but highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I down the bottle in one go and take the rest of the smokes with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrive at the thrift shop, it turns out I am there on a day when my potential savior is not working, so I get her number from the clerk\nand head over to a payphone and realize... I have no money. So I decide to go on a quest for dropped pocket change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I even leave the parking lot, I see a young man, no older than 23, sitting on a nice red classic-style Corvette and he&amp;#39;s\nreading William S. Burroughs. So naturally, I decide to strike up a conversation with the young man. Turns out he&amp;#39;s the nicest guy\nand his name is Jordan. So him and I got together and decided to go out for a game of disc golf (some may not know what this is;\nImagine frisbee but with a golf theme, so you need to get from a tee pad into a basket. Really fun, centering, and extremely popular\nwith potheads, Californians, beer-drinkers, and hippies) and before we go, he asks if I would like to snag a few beers first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tell him a piece of my story and he can tell I am down on my luck and broke so he decides to help me out. He buys us both some beer\nand we proceed to disk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out he&amp;#39;s an ex-junkie and has been through quite a bit of hell himself, so we find that we&amp;#39;re in a good position to help each\nother make some better decisions in life. After the game, we go over to a payphone and he gives me money to call my friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buzz (this the only name I am not changing because her name is fucking badass) answers the phone and unfortunately informs me that\nthough she would take me in any day of the year, she just moved in to a house with one older lady she takes care of, and its a single\nbedroom apartment, so there is just no way it can work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I go back to his car and tell him the news, and he says he thinks he may be able to put me up for a few days until I can sort\neverything out. We go back out to the store and grab ourselves a fifth of vodka.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We end up in the park playing music, talking, performing standup for one another, and I begin to realize I am drinking too fast,\nso I try to ease back a little. He was playing a version of a Radiohead song I had never heard before&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone this way. Okay, get your hands against the wall. Spread your legs. Don&amp;#39;t move.&amp;quot;\nThe doors clanking, some asshole won&amp;#39;t shut up in the next cell over.\nMore slamming of doors, someone rubbing my body all over trying to find my knives, no doubt.\nAnd my AK 47 I conceal, and my weed, and my ... oh shit, I really did have weed on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Move forward. Turn around. Alright, go to bed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Get up.

This bed is not covered. There is no comfort. It&amp;#39;s just a mat. And I have no pillow. This is not a house\nof any sort, my bag isnt what I am sleeping on. Something is very wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am in jail. Oh of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the answer before I hear it, but I ask anyway: &amp;quot;What are my charges, ma&amp;#39;am?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Drunk in public.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------\u00ad------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about thirty miles or so North of inner Seattle. Not a bad place to be. I&amp;#39;m working for a Safeway. It&amp;#39;s somewhere around\nthe first of June. I receive word that Bri has been on heroin. And I may have left at a crucial time in her life thinking\nonly of myself, but I needed to go somewhere I could be productive. Yet my decision left her in a position where she turned\nto hard drugs... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but feel I am to blame. I am listening to the dull, stupid words of my ex boss, Rod, who is telling me\nthat even though I may feel like I need to help her, there is nothing I can do for her, so I should bury myself in my work\ninstead. He tells me this in about six hundred different ways before I leave the room after twenty minutes. Well great.\nI may have no focus here at work today, but at least I killed almost a half hour of the day just listening to someone\nbullshit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am at a loss of what to do here, but I eventually get a hold of her, and after a long time not talking, we come to\nsomewhat of a closure, and she is beginning to sober up herself. I realize we were both in incredibly hard times, and I still\nwish with all my heart there could have been some way I could have helped her raise that boy and stayed and been her\nlove, and at the same time, still go to college, and progress and get a good job...but I was in a small Northern California\ntown. There was nothing left, all the old shops were out of business. It was time for me to move on then, and we have\nall seen better days for it. She looks incredible these days by the way. She lost an insane amount of weight, and I know\na lot of it had to do with the drugs, but if she truly is sober like she says she is, she&amp;#39;ll be getting much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago 3 people I used to know and hang out with died in the span of a week. It was a terrible tragedy, and I have been\nthinking back on all the names of people I used to love very, very much before they got lost in some way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s Lorne Holly, who killed himself after a few weeks of detoxing from crank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Layla Harmon, who died in a car crash, blunt head trauma, with a drunk driver (I have a tattoo for this, I will never drive drunk).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heavy Eagle, who killed himself after years of drug problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chaz Lipman, who died in a car crash as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ren Rain, who I am still not sure about...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, Tray Beraldi, who was my closest friend&amp;#39;s cousin... I wish I were there to mourne with him...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I got a text from my best friend, who said he couldn&amp;#39;t sleep and he barely eats anything anymore, and he feels like his throat\nis going to explode, and he cant swallow and his neck is killing him constantly. He has been this way for a year, and he is talking constantly\nabout getting a gun and blowing his head off. And no one believes him because he constantly talks about it because he is in so much pain.\nNo doctor can diagnose him so far, he has no idea what&amp;#39;s wrong with him, he&amp;#39;s been tested all over the place, he has no hope, he&amp;#39;s barely\ncligning and he doesn&amp;#39;t know how much longer he can hold on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I really want to say is&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord? What I have done? I don&amp;#39;t pray, I never pray, I don&amp;#39;t even know who I would pray to. But WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE TO DO?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bring myself across hell and I pull myself from the worst depression I have ever experienced, and all I ask of you is to just\nSTOP. KILLING. MY. FRIENDS. PLEASE?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe the other effective way is to just state...\n&amp;quot;I just wish my friends would stop fucking dying.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the real point here is that we all feel pain. But don&amp;#39;t try and compare our pain...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ridiculous. To say the only experiences in life are depressing ones because bliss is ignorance is a simple statement. Pain shouldn&amp;#39;t have to be felt. Pain like these all can stem from something much bigger than us, it&amp;#39;s much more integrated into society than we think. It&amp;#39;s control. We need to realize, we&amp;#39;re being divided, we&amp;#39;re being hushed, the idea is to keep us in this pain, to make us all miserable, to make us want to die. Docile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is, make a good future for yourself. Because that story up there is not worth bragging about&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years. I am living with my future wife, shes five months pregnant. One night i got so sick of working a dead end job after months of promises to move up by my boss that I stole a bottle of vodka and got blackout drunk and went home. I don&amp;#39;t know if I ever finished that bottle or if someone poured it but all i know is I blamed my fiance. We got into a huge argument and I remember stopping myself as I sat straddled above her, seconds away from punching her in the stomach. She left me and after a while gave me another shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to rehab, got cleaned up and months later we had our baby. Then we moved out to another state because my mother is here and it&amp;#39;s cheaper. Fast forward to my daughter at nine months old. I fall off the wagon and we get in another fight. We end up arguing over a hash oil cartridge we bought together and in my drunken stupor her and I get into a physical struggle over it. The next day is the same. She leaves me. I think I am going to lose my daughter. This is a cycle btw. Her leaving and giving me another shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was one month ago today actually and I am really excited to go to an AA meeting and get my one month chip. My fiance has given me one more shot, which is amazing, in her infinite patience and wisdom she somehow still stuck by me, though I know she didn&amp;#39;t want to. We are doing well now, she has let me back in her life and my daughter is much better for it now that i can be counted on to be a proper father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to make it known that i have never been a violent person but if the drink can actually make me that awful, it can do anything to anyone. I urge anyone who actually stuck through this story to PLEASE seek help immediately if they think they have a problem. If there is any doubt in your mind, it will very likely only get worse. Go to a meeting. Find a counselor. Don&amp;#39;t waste five years of your life like I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks if you managed to read all that&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Been lurking for months but decided to finally up and make a profile. I got a pretty damn long story so if you guys are interested I am going to unload all of it in its entirety. But for your sake, \n\nTL;DR: I was an alcoholic right after high school and it was so bad I was homeless, and that still wasn't enough to get me to quit.\n\nThe beginning of this story i wrote a long time ago so it's copy pasted here from hellopoetry:\n\n\"School was always humuorous to a degree in my opinion because of the underlying idea\nthat the more damaged you were, the cooler you were in the eyes of the rest of the school.\nI have heard numerous conversations that began with something along the lines of, \"Oh, you\nthink YOU got it bad, well my dad blah blah and my best friend blah blah and my life is hell.\"\n\nI decided to get a little personal and share with you guys something I have never actually\ntold anyone in entirety yet. I am pretty sure the whole story is still only here in my brain.\nI will, out of respect for these people, change their names.\n\nIt's October 31, 2012. It's about noon, and all of us sixteen to twenty-two year olds are just waking up.\nBrianne woke up probably a few hours ago already to tend to her son, Aaron. He is adorable, one\nand a half, blond hair, blue eyes. I have been living here for nearly two months. I am supporting her,\nAaron, and myself with food stamps. I get two hundred dollars a month to basically smoke weed and drink\non the government's budget. Trust me, I'm not proud of it either, and if I could I would pay it back.\nSince Brianne is a single mother and an adopted child, she has a single-digit monthly rent (I was fucking\nbaffled to hear this) and receives support from her foster parents. Basically, if I want to stay here forever\nwith absolutely no consequences save to miss out on a life of my own, I can.\n\nBrandon is putting on clown make-up so he can troll the streets as a juggalo. I find this amusing as I always\nliked to mess around with ICP fans, but he's a really cool kid so I let it go and I even help him perfect it.\nI notice he has a bottle of Stolichnaya in his backpack and it's practically full. That, to me, is temptation.\nI ask if he would mind me taking a few drinks here and there from the bottle and he says it's fine, so I proceed\nto get a nice one p.m. buzz. It was always my favorite drunk, very light, and airy, almost like you're still asleep.\nSomething bogs you down, but it doesn't bother you, somehow it makes you lighter.\n\nFor the rest of the day, we hook up with a few friends, go out and trick or treat in the pouring rain, get soaked\nand wait for two hours under an overpass while Brianne goes and gets her car. From there, we proceed home.\n\nAt this point, everyone is over at Breanne's and we're all making dinner and drinking beer and having a good time\n(Aaron is with the grandparents tonight). I guess I started getting angry about the recent events (for about a month,\neveryone in our group with the exception of Brandon have been slowly losing items...but they're obviously being stolen.\nAt a point, a few of us did some research and determined the only person who could possibly have stolen\na good deal of these things has to be Brandon) and I decided I was tired of sitting on the news waiting for no one to make\na move after a solid two weeks of being certain that we had our guy. So I called him out... and proceeded\nto begin burning bridges slowly and very surely for the next few days. I am pretty sure a fight would have broken out\nif Bri hadn't taken me into her room to relax. When I finally do, it turns out I woke up the upstairs neighbor,\nher baby, and everyone in the house has left save for my friend Jeff and his girlfriend Marissa. This concludes night one.\n\nI later learned that Brandon was not actually the person who was stealing from us (unless of course\nhe just happened to not get caught when we found out who had done most of it) and I feel bad for bringing the whole\nthing up because I would have liked to stay in touch with him. We got along swimmingly and he actually did have\na lot of interesting things to talk about. Smart, nice, hilarious... Well, maybe he'll turn up one day.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up to find the house empty save for Jeff and Marissa in the next room, but where I am,\nit simply appears empty. I don't know what happened but I intuit that I have been sleeping all night without\nmy girlfriend. This upsets me and I begin to weep like a confused child, which is exactly what you do when you're\nhelpless and too drunk in the brain to figure out how to pull yourself out of a helpless situation (trust me,\nI own the handbook). Marissa walks in and begins to explain to me that I had scared her too much and she slept\non the couch and that she had left to go pick up her son. So I realize I need to calm down, but I can feel\nJeff is not happy with me in the slightest, considering he will not come and talk to me (this is extremely painful\nbecause he is probably one of the best friends I have ever had, with a mind that vastly exceeds that of everyone\nI have met save one other, and he's a different story). They leave and I decide to stay in the house all day.\n\nThis is a very bad idea. I stay home, watch re-runs of a show I have seen billions of times, and considering\nthat Brandon and I are no longer on good terms, like a complete asshole, I drink the rest of his vodka.\n\nIn walks Bri, it's around 7. She's not happy. She proceeds to tell me that the night before I asked out a friend of mine\nand she said yes. And I was a bit shocked because I couldn't remember it at first. Then it all hit me.\n\nA few days before, Aaron called me \"dad.\" Now remember, this is not my child. I am dark, dark, dark, and she had this kid\nabout two years after we had any past relationship. I am extremely worried in my mind and I realize I am headed toward nothing.\nThat I am stagnant and can not even afford to go back to school. This scares me, so I drunkenly asked out Tanya.\n\nTanya...we had been friends for about five years, and I had tried to get with her so many damn times... she was like\none of those girls you see and you're instantly reminded of an anime character. Tall, thin, beautiful hips, perfect\nproportions, lovely hair, eyes, voice, and a personality I can liken to a Disney princess/black metal lumberjack.\nThe kind of girl who has a tough exterior, but inside, she just wants someone to tell her everything is going to be ok.\n\nAfter about two hours of pleading with Bri to let me stay, I finally send Tanya a message, and we hang out for the next\ntwo days, whence I whisper in her ear that everything is going to be okay and we proceed to have quite passionate sex\nfor those nights, where I discovered the secret to making a woman climax with my tongue (tip: if the underside of your\ntongue isn't completely torn apart, you're doing something wrong). But alas, I could not stay.\n\nThis is the part I dreaded, because I know I have to go back to Jeff's house and ask him if I can stay there for a while.\nAnd I got the answer I expected.\n\nThe words he used...\n\n\"I'm pissed off...extremely pissed off at you, and disappointed.\" It was like a father saying it to you. And him and I\nhave a very interesting friendship built on such an extreme understanding that I knew exactly how badly I had been spiraling.\nI began to leave and he gave me a slice of pizza, with that slight smile that told me \"just go find yourself, we'll be fine.\"\n\nI hobbled off into the night drunk, with one piece of pizza and all my food at Bri's, which could have lasted me another few days,\neasing the transition into homeless. And it could have prevented a horrible occurance that took place the following afternoon. I\nwas crying, because I knew I was dying, but I didn't want to ask either of my parents for help, because this was the first time\nI was out on my own and I was far too proud to give up and let the world make me its victim. So I walked...\n\nSixteen fucking miles...\n\nTo the next town. Took me all night because I was dodging traffic, easing into trees, avoiding on and off ramps, trying to stay\naway from any police that may exist on the road. When I finally arrived in the next town (where I knew I may have one contact)\nI decided to sleep until the morning came so I could have the energy to find my next venture.\n\nIt was five thirty am. I had 3 hours until sun-up, I had just walked enough to be burning, and there was plenty of whiskey in my veins.\nI had left my sleeping bag with Tanya hours earlier, wishing in the park that I had not been so naiive as to think I would be allowed\nback in the house. So I pulled out a pile of dirty clothes and put them over me like blankets, in some random corner of the local\npark, under some bushes, hidden from cold and sight, with great hope...\n\nFifteen minutes pass. My eyes shoot open. I am freezing. The sweat has dried and frozen to my body. This is hell.\n\nI grab my things and with the worst effort I can ever remember myself mustering, I drag myself to the toilet.\nWhen I open it, the first thing I check for is cleanliness. It's spotless. I am so relieved. I sit in the corner of the room,\nwhich my knees to my chest, head in my hands, wrapped in a leather jacket I had gotten from Jeff (ha, he really is my\nguardian angel, though he would laugh to hear it).\n\nI catch winks, occasionally looking up to check if the sun is rising. When it finally is, I get up, change my clothes (I had\nONE clean set of clothing and it had been rotting with the rest in the backpack) and immediately head to a thrift store where\na family friend is working.\n\nOn my way there, I notice in a little parking lot near the store a sight I had never actually come across but I always thought\nwould be the most amazing luck, and it was timed in such a spot in my life that it was the ultimate miracle...and a curse in\ndisguise.\n\nIn front of my eyes (this miracle appeared in my path as I was walking looking down, so it startled me) was the worst possible thing\nfor me: A half finished fifth of Smirnoff, and a half smoked pack of Marlboro 100 Reds. I open the pack and sure enough, the celophane\nprotected every cigarette inside from any water damage. I am ecstatic. This is not only amazing, but highly unlikely.\n\nSo I down the bottle in one go and take the rest of the smokes with me.\n\nWhen I arrive at the thrift shop, it turns out I am there on a day when my potential savior is not working, so I get her number from the clerk\nand head over to a payphone and realize... I have no money. So I decide to go on a quest for dropped pocket change.\n\nBefore I even leave the parking lot, I see a young man, no older than 23, sitting on a nice red classic-style Corvette and he's\nreading William S. Burroughs. So naturally, I decide to strike up a conversation with the young man. Turns out he's the nicest guy\nand his name is Jordan. So him and I got together and decided to go out for a game of disc golf (some may not know what this is;\nImagine frisbee but with a golf theme, so you need to get from a tee pad into a basket. Really fun, centering, and extremely popular\nwith potheads, Californians, beer-drinkers, and hippies) and before we go, he asks if I would like to snag a few beers first.\n\nI tell him a piece of my story and he can tell I am down on my luck and broke so he decides to help me out. He buys us both some beer\nand we proceed to disk.\n\nTurns out he's an ex-junkie and has been through quite a bit of hell himself, so we find that we're in a good position to help each\nother make some better decisions in life. After the game, we go over to a payphone and he gives me money to call my friend.\n\nBuzz (this the only name I am not changing because her name is fucking badass) answers the phone and unfortunately informs me that\nthough she would take me in any day of the year, she just moved in to a house with one older lady she takes care of, and its a single\nbedroom apartment, so there is just no way it can work.\n\nSo I go back to his car and tell him the news, and he says he thinks he may be able to put me up for a few days until I can sort\neverything out. We go back out to the store and grab ourselves a fifth of vodka.\n\nWe end up in the park playing music, talking, performing standup for one another, and I begin to realize I am drinking too fast,\nso I try to ease back a little. He was playing a version of a Radiohead song I had never heard before\n\n\"Everyone this way. Okay, get your hands against the wall. Spread your legs. Don't move.\"\nThe doors clanking, some asshole won't shut up in the next cell over.\nMore slamming of doors, someone rubbing my body all over trying to find my knives, no doubt.\nAnd my AK 47 I conceal, and my weed, and my ... oh shit, I really did have weed on me.\n\n\"Move forward. Turn around. Alright, go to bed.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\n\"Get up. Come on, slowly... There you go. There's a few more coming in so we got to get you to another cell.\"\n\nClank, clank...\n\n\"Pick a bed.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------\n\nSomething is wrong. This bed is not covered. There is no comfort. It's just a mat. And I have no pillow. This is not a house\nof any sort, my bag isnt what I am sleeping on. Something is very wrong here.\n\nI am in jail. Oh of course.\n\nI know the answer before I hear it, but I ask anyway: \"What are my charges, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Drunk in public.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\u00ad------------------------\n\nI'm about thirty miles or so North of inner Seattle.

Earlier this year I went through a bad breakup and I&amp;#39;ve been drinking daily. Pretty sure I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic now. Drinking is my main focus. Hobbies are being ignored, I&amp;#39;m avoiding socializing with anyone (Besides walking to liquor store I&amp;#39;m only leaving the house once a week) When I don&amp;#39;t drink it&amp;#39;s impossible to sleep, my limbs hurt, I&amp;#39;m super depressed. When I do drink I can&amp;#39;t stop until every drop of alcohol in my house is gone. If I weren&amp;#39;t self employed I&amp;#39;d be homeless for sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I try to quit every week but it&amp;#39;s basically impossible. 10 years ago I stopped shooting H cold turkey but alcohol has this death grip. I don&amp;#39;t get it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kratom is sort of helping but other than that my life feels like it&amp;#39;s on a slow decline.

Earlier this year I went through a bad breakup and I've been drinking daily. Pretty sure I'm an alcoholic now. Drinking is my main focus. Hobbies are being ignored, I'm avoiding socializing with anyone (Besides walking to liquor store I'm only leaving the house once a week) When I don't drink it's impossible to sleep, my limbs hurt, I'm super depressed. When I do drink I can't stop until every drop of alcohol in my house is gone. If I weren't self employed I'd be homeless for sure. \n\nI try to quit every week but it's basically impossible. 10 years ago I stopped shooting H cold turkey but alcohol has this death grip. I don't get it. \n\nKratom is sort of helping but other than that my life feels like it's on a slow decline. I'm pretty sure I have some nerve damage and my mouth bleeds among other things. I hate this.\n\nI guess my questions is this: For those of you who have replaced alcohol in order to quit.

At this point I wasn&amp;#39;t drinking alone and wasn&amp;#39;t getting black out drunk. Definitely getting hammered cuz why? Friday night and friends of course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now somewhere between 21 and 23 I started drinking about 2 bottles of liquor a week smoking way too much pot and taking pills a few times a week along with my sales of the illegal substances. Some time during the 23rd year I had a moment of clarity and stopped selling everything and moved a state away to start fresh. Still drinking, smoking and popping pills of course. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue the new job and drugs tests. I stop smoking pot and taking pills except the occasional session( once every 3-6 months) and start drinking more heavily. A bottle or more every two days. Here is where the blackouts start.

I go to a buddies house play some guitar, drink a few annnd black out, drive my truck for roughly 2 hours on a busy highway late at night and bang I hit a guy in a suv wake up in jail with my newly acquired Dui and barely any recollection of the previous night. I take care of that business and go about life still drinking occasionally, smoking pot maybe once or twice a year and taking a Xanax when ever anxiety was too much to handle alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to new years night 2016/2017. I drink my champagne and on a whim say I&amp;#39;m done. no substances what so ever for the next year. Here I am in the end of October.

I wonder if I could maintain a level head, would it be safe to drink?

I jog every morning!&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m sure some of you are gonna see where this is going...the &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; is vodka.

Financially im fairly secure, and we watch our money well to allow ourselves frivoloties like this. \n\nWhat would you guys recommend i do? how do i approach this?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "791jms", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "This gets asked here a lot, but can someone give me an honest overview of my drinking habits.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 11, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_791jms", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/791jms/this_gets_asked_here_a_lot_but_can_someone_give/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1509114829.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/791jms/this_gets_asked_here_a_lot_but_can_someone_give/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "great-nba-comment", "created_utc": 1509086029.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic.

I said you can\u2019t stop!  I started to cry because he started to threaten the relationship. I began crying in public. I tried to conceal but he was being so mean. \n\nHe said that\u2019s it! You are going to rehab! You and your drinking. At that point I had not quite 3 glasses of wine. It was our date night. \n\nHe had 2 cocktails himself. But he said the problem is me. \n\nIn reality I drink probably too much. But do I need rehab?  My girlfriends drink wine daily as well. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "78y533", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "My fianc\u00e9 threatened rehab.

I've suffered from anxiety &amp; depression for years, and through therapy and medication I've managed to keep the two conditions fairly under control, but alcohol use on the other hand, has been torturous. Please, former alcoholics of Reddit, how? How did you quit? Or at least be more responsible with your consumption?\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "78m8ko", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I'm a 26 year old alcoholic.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 7, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_78m8ko", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/78m8ko/im_a_26_year_old_alcoholic/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508946853.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/78m8ko/im_a_26_year_old_alcoholic/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "TheTomas126", "created_utc": 1508918053.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "78n2a4", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I just quit smoking weed and am trying to stop drinking but am struggling.

My grandma saw me pour a mimosa at about 9 am one day of vacation and now thinks I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic so I won&amp;#39;t drink infront of her at all anymore- no one wants people thinking that, especially not your grandma. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do feel the need to hide it sometimes- I&amp;#39;ve poured water into vodka and whisky bottles to make it look fuller.

Sometimes I wonder if I would be prone to going off the deep end if I didn&amp;#39;t have a highly opinionated family who think drinking a single beer every day or a mimosa at 9 am means you have a problem.

I detoxed by myself at home; my bed drenched as much with tears as perspiration as I shivered and had auditory hallucinations.

But, I promised myself I would wait 5 minutes whenever I had this idea. And then I&amp;#39;d wait another 5 minutes, and another 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attending AA everyday, or several times a day, was the big excitement in this time.

I continued going to AA pretty much every day for many months. It wasn&amp;#39;t my first time in AA, but it was the first time I truly had given up. My state of living as an alcoholic was so poor, I was readily willing to accept anything AA was going to tell me, if it could help me to not drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days people I talk to, with and without alcohol problems, often remark how much &amp;quot;will power&amp;quot; I have. There was some will power involved, perhaps. But I would not be sober today had I not started going to AA. I would not be sober today had I not come to accept that that was a necessary step. I would not be sober today, unless I had achieved a degree of humility by having time and again learned through expirement that my ego and my drinking were my enemies, not my strengths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I drank for about 10 years, every day. The last few years of which I only remember patches. Towards the end, months would go by, and I would be surprised to look at the calendar, or look at the changing of the weather, and realize that I was operating at a very different speed than the rest of the world. Indeed, the times when I was sober to notice what was truly going on around me were very few, in those days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In those times, I would take my car out bar hopping. I would close out one bar every night one week, then switch bars, after I&amp;#39;d pissed off a sufficient portion of staff and or patrons and needed some cooling off time. I would drive around blind drunk all over the city. I didn&amp;#39;t care about my own life, and my need to escape reality was more important than the safety of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My boss issued me an ultimatum. Get sober, or get a new job. I knew intuitively that I was in no position to be finding a new job, drinking like I was. That really wasn&amp;#39;t an option. I&amp;#39;d just be drunk /and/ unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend issued me the same ultimatum. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gone until you&amp;#39;re sober.&amp;quot; I loved her. She was gone and stayed gone. Among other things, I had destroyed several thousand dollars worth of her property, drunk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family for the most part stayed with me, but they knew to keep a safe distance and to be realistic about their expectations. I had sent countless barely sensible, scathing texts and emails and voicemails to them -- hateful and emotionally abusive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only women that I dated in these last several years of drinking were just as alcoholic as me. Each and every of the relationships was poisonous. I hate violence, and I had always sworn to myself never to use it to resolve conflicts, and absolutely not on a woman. But, here and there, I was physically violent with my partners. This is in addition to the emotional abuse I doled out regularly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A biker that I saw at the bar sometimes began seeing one of these girls, and so was aware of what I&amp;#39;d been up to. I began having to watch my back as I went around town, never knowing when he was going to kick the shit out of me. So I found new bars, driving farther away to reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally a slim person, I was probably 25 pounds overweight, and my face constantly glowed red, and my heart beat noticeably too fast, always. My stomach lining was so badly damaged that I had begun to have digestion problems. My bladder control suffered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would never have less than 6 drinks, unless it was a &amp;quot;recovery day,&amp;quot; when I was not physically well enough to make it out of the house to get to the store. On a more average day, it was more like 10 drinks. On the extreme &amp;quot;days&amp;quot;, I would wake up, and just drink, and drink, and there really were no &amp;quot;days&amp;quot;. My sleeping was so irregular that these were really just bits of stooper in between drinking more, for weeks -- on a few occasions, over a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While drugs were never really my first choice, I did sometimes like to blow some lines. Around 3AM one night I was piss drunk and thought I&amp;#39;d go down to the trap house I&amp;#39;d never been to. I found myself stuck there for a time, arguing with a gang member with a gun. I made it out, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Near the end, I grabbed my guitar and took a taxi to a local rehab. I passed out in front, on the grass. Before sunrise, security came by and told me they wouldn&amp;#39;t be open until (some reasonable hour) and that I couldn&amp;#39;t be smoking cigarettes so close to the entrance. As the sun came out, heroin addicts came to get their methodone. And me, standing their clueless with my guitar as the city woke up and normal people went about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last drink I had, I went to one of my favorite bars. The bartender invited me to stay after closing hours and drink whiskeys and smoke indoors. Cool! I was there until 4am or so. I shared that it would be my last day drinking -- it was of course something I&amp;#39;d said lots of times before. But it was going to make showing up there a week later considerably more awkward, and I knew I had to begin to create some distance for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally, I think I believed that I could get my girlfriend back, if I quit drinking. I did want to do it for myself, though. But I also wanted her back. Of course, I didn&amp;#39;t realize that in just 30 days I would realize that she was an &amp;quot;alcoholic girlfriend&amp;quot;, and was terrible for me. I didn&amp;#39;t want her back at all, now that the mist had lifted a bit. But man, I sure wanted to keep being sober -- because man, after coming off your last month-long bender, a month of sobriety is fucking awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most stark effect in the early days for me was the sheer amount of free time I began to have. Going to the bar, drinking, getting drunk, coming home, sleeping, waking up with a hangover, waiting for the point in the day you feel kind of okay -- this actually takes up pretty much the whole day. I had literally gone from not having a life, being a slave to alcohol and letting it consume all of my time -- to just being like, some guy, with not much going on with his time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To fill the time, I needed something to do. I hadn&amp;#39;t really developed many new skills or hobbies in the past decade. So I had to draw from things I&amp;#39;d managed to keep doing over the years, or things that I enjoyed doing as a kid. Some of these hobbies felt trite and juvenile. But as I noted before, I had simply reached a point where I did not give a fuck; I needed a way to spend my time, so I&amp;#39;d just do whatever I could reach for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also recognized the importance of getting some exercise. The body and mind seem to have this anxious shock to them for several months after you quit drinking. Nervous energy that needs an outlet. Smoking a shit ton of cigarettes helped minimally, but I still needed to do pushups randomly throughout the day, and do sports. This also happened to be a decent way to connect with some friends in a way that wasn&amp;#39;t all about getting shit-faced. My friends that still talked to me were mostly weary of going drinking with me by then, anyway. They would always want to leave before me -- me who would close out a bar, then get a case of beer before the stores stop selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, in some cases -- I use to run out of booze and then just go wait outside the store until 8am when it was legal to buy alcohol again. Your body feels terrible when you skip sleep, and keep a binge going throughout the next day. So drained, so detached from the world, so isolated. A mix of hangover, sleep deprivation, and being actually super drunk, all together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found that with all my free time, I could show up to work on time, and do a good job, and that people started to appreciate me being a part of the team again. It took a lot of time to rebuilt trust, and in some cases I was never able to. I ultimately left, getting a better job -- a job that I would never have been able to get had I still been drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a year into my sobriety, I met a beautiful young woman and she quickly moved in with me. We were both sober, and we treated each other with respect and fairness. It was an experience I had basically never had before. There were a lot of strokes of luck for me in getting sober, but this was certainly a major one. Having a supportive and loving companion helps considerably, to stay sober. But of course, if you&amp;#39;re as fucked up as I was, the chances of you finding someone like this while actively drinking -- and not totally blowing the thing up in flames -- are almost 0%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I actually had more (not fewer) dates with women after I quit drinking. In the decade of my drinking, going out to bars, I&amp;#39;d maybe managed to bring home 5 girls this way, let&amp;#39;s say. For the most part, they were one night stands with girls that weren&amp;#39;t much to look at it. And I probably didn&amp;#39;t perform very well. So, in reality, whatever I was doing really wasn&amp;#39;t working, in evidence. Of course looking back on it, a brooding, completely intoxicated loner at a bar who barely has the self confidence to approach you -- probably isn&amp;#39;t what most girls are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reasons other people, women -- and men -- and myself -- like me better, are roughly the same. I&amp;#39;m walking around on planet earth now (most of the time.) I have some basic control over my emotions and don&amp;#39;t vacillate between such wild highs and lows all of the time. When I say I&amp;#39;m going to do something, I usually do actually do it, because I&amp;#39;m conscious of the future event, when it takes place. When I tell /myself/ I&amp;#39;m going to do something, the likelihood that I&amp;#39;ll do it is considerably higher, now. I still am working on this -- being honest to myself, and accountable to myself, about goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had such elaborate dreams when I was drinking, which I could never take even the first step on. Because my first step was always to the bar. I&amp;#39;d be stuck there, and then think the same thoughts, dreaming on about some goal that I&amp;#39;d never have the time to accomplish, since I&amp;#39;d always be drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the most important things to me. I like having time to participate in life. Sometimes life is hard. But I have enough self confidence and faith now to weather these periods. Eventually, they end, and cool things happen. I&amp;#39;m able to set goals for myself and use my time to achieve them. I don&amp;#39;t have to lie to people. I can look people in the eyes when I talk to them -- and when I realize I&amp;#39;m not, it means I&amp;#39;m not being honest, and I can catch it, and stop it. I&amp;#39;ve learned to be cautious of my character defects, as they will only come back to cause my grief when I do exercise them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be so much to give up, to drink again. To lose all of my hobbies, my projects, my confidence, my health. And these are just the nice things that I&amp;#39;ve /gained back/. As a progressive disease, things are known to get &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;. So, that place where I left off -- it was hitting women, losing my job, getting a DUI (or worse), and feeling completely uncomfortable with my own existence all the time. That guy was a fucking loser. I don&amp;#39;t want to be him again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this extended rant is valuable to someone. I guess my TL;DR is: if you&amp;#39;re ready to quit drinking, you can do it. Go to AA (a lot). Make a plan for what you&amp;#39;re going to do with all of your newly found free time. Make a plan for how you&amp;#39;ll handle nervous and anxious energy, of which you&amp;#39;ll have a boatload. Processing emotions will be a weird and uncomfortable new experience, but it gets easier the longer you don&amp;#39;t drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "On October 10th, I reached my nine-hundredth ninety-ninth day of sobriety.

I would drive around blind drunk all over the city. I didn't care about my own life, and my need to escape reality was more important than the safety of others.\n\nMy boss issued me an ultimatum. Get sober, or get a new job. I knew intuitively that I was in no position to be finding a new job, drinking like I was. That really wasn't an option. I'd just be drunk /and/ unemployed.\n\nMy girlfriend issued me the same ultimatum. \"I'm gone until you're sober.\" I loved her. She was gone and stayed gone. Among other things, I had destroyed several thousand dollars worth of her property, drunk.\n\nMy family for the most part stayed with me, but they knew to keep a safe distance and to be realistic about their expectations. I had sent countless barely sensible, scathing texts and emails and voicemails to them -- hateful and emotionally abusive.\n\nThe only women that I dated in these last several years of drinking were just as alcoholic as me. Each and every of the relationships was poisonous. I hate violence, and I had always sworn to myself never to use it to resolve conflicts, and absolutely not on a woman. But, here and there, I was physically violent with my partners. This is in addition to the emotional abuse I doled out regularly.\n\nA biker that I saw at the bar sometimes began seeing one of these girls, and so was aware of what I'd been up to. I began having to watch my back as I went around town, never knowing when he was going to kick the shit out of me. So I found new bars, driving farther away to reach.\n\nNaturally a slim person, I was probably 25 pounds overweight, and my face constantly glowed red, and my heart beat noticeably too fast, always. My stomach lining was so badly damaged that I had begun to have digestion problems. My bladder control suffered.\n\nI would never have less than 6 drinks, unless it was a \"recovery day,\" when I was not physically well enough to make it out of the house to get to the store. On a more average day, it was more like 10 drinks. On the extreme \"days\", I would wake up, and just drink, and drink, and there really were no \"days\". My sleeping was so irregular that these were really just bits of stooper in between drinking more, for weeks -- on a few occasions, over a month.\n\nWhile drugs were never really my first choice, I did sometimes like to blow some lines. Around 3AM one night I was piss drunk and thought I'd go down to the trap house I'd never been to. I found myself stuck there for a time, arguing with a gang member with a gun. I made it out, apparently.\n\nNear the end, I grabbed my guitar and took a taxi to a local rehab. I passed out in front, on the grass. Before sunrise, security came by and told me they wouldn't be open until (some reasonable hour) and that I couldn't be smoking cigarettes so close to the entrance. As the sun came out, heroin addicts came to get their methodone. And me, standing their clueless with my guitar as the city woke up and normal people went about their lives.\n\nThe last drink I had, I went to one of my favorite bars. The bartender invited me to stay after closing hours and drink whiskeys and smoke indoors. Cool! I was there until 4am or so. I shared that it would be my last day drinking -- it was of course something I'd said lots of times before. But it was going to make showing up there a week later considerably more awkward, and I knew I had to begin to create some distance for myself.\n\nOriginally, I think I believed that I could get my girlfriend back, if I quit drinking. I did want to do it for myself, though. But I also wanted her back. Of course, I didn't realize that in just 30 days I would realize that she was an \"alcoholic girlfriend\", and was terrible for me. I didn't want her back at all, now that the mist had lifted a bit. But man, I sure wanted to keep being sober -- because man, after coming off your last month-long bender, a month of sobriety is fucking awesome.\n\nThe most stark effect in the early days for me was the sheer amount of free time I began to have. Going to the bar, drinking, getting drunk, coming home, sleeping, waking up with a hangover, waiting for the point in the day you feel kind of okay -- this actually takes up pretty much the whole day. I had literally gone from not having a life, being a slave to alcohol and letting it consume all of my time -- to just being like, some guy, with not much going on with his time.\n\nTo fill the time, I needed something to do. I hadn't really developed many new skills or hobbies in the past decade. So I had to draw from things I'd managed to keep doing over the years, or things that I enjoyed doing as a kid. Some of these hobbies felt trite and juvenile. But as I noted before, I had simply reached a point where I did not give a fuck; I needed a way to spend my time, so I'd just do whatever I could reach for.\n\nI also recognized the importance of getting some exercise. The body and mind seem to have this anxious shock to them for several months after you quit drinking. Nervous energy that needs an outlet. Smoking a shit ton of cigarettes helped minimally, but I still needed to do pushups randomly throughout the day, and do sports. This also happened to be a decent way to connect with some friends in a way that wasn't all about getting shit-faced. My friends that still talked to me were mostly weary of going drinking with me by then, anyway. They would always want to leave before me -- me who would close out a bar, then get a case of beer before the stores stop selling.\n\nOr, in some cases -- I use to run out of booze and then just go wait outside the store until 8am when it was legal to buy alcohol again. Your body feels terrible when you skip sleep, and keep a binge going throughout the next day. So drained, so detached from the world, so isolated. A mix of hangover, sleep deprivation, and being actually super drunk, all together.\n\nI found that with all my free time, I could show up to work on time, and do a good job, and that people started to appreciate me being a part of the team again. It took a lot of time to rebuilt trust, and in some cases I was never able to. I ultimately left, getting a better job -- a job that I would never have been able to get had I still been drinking.\n\nAbout a year into my sobriety, I met a beautiful young woman and she quickly moved in with me. We were both sober, and we treated each other with respect and fairness. It was an experience I had basically never had before. There were a lot of strokes of luck for me in getting sober, but this was certainly a major one. Having a supportive and loving companion helps considerably, to stay sober. But of course, if you're as fucked up as I was, the chances of you finding someone like this while actively drinking -- and not totally blowing the thing up in flames -- are almost 0%.\n\nTo my surprise, I actually had more (not fewer) dates with women after I quit drinking. In the decade of my drinking, going out to bars, I'd maybe managed to bring home 5 girls this way, let's say. For the most part, they were one night stands with girls that weren't much to look at it. And I probably didn't perform very well. So, in reality, whatever I was doing really wasn't working, in evidence. Of course looking back on it, a brooding, completely intoxicated loner at a bar who barely has the self confidence to approach you -- probably isn't what most girls are looking for.\n\nThe reasons other people, women -- and men -- and myself -- like me better, are roughly the same. I'm walking around on planet earth now (most of the time.) I have some basic control over my emotions and don't vacillate between such wild highs and lows all of the time. When I say I'm going to do something, I usually do actually do it, because I'm conscious of the future event, when it takes place. When I tell /myself/ I'm going to do something, the likelihood that I'll do it is considerably higher, now. I still am working on this -- being honest to myself, and accountable to myself, about goals.\n\nI had such elaborate dreams when I was drinking, which I could never take even the first step on. Because my first step was always to the bar. I'd be stuck there, and then think the same thoughts, dreaming on about some goal that I'd never have the time to accomplish, since I'd always be drinking.\n\nThese are the most important things to me. I like having time to participate in life. Sometimes life is hard. But I have enough self confidence and faith now to weather these periods. Eventually, they end, and cool things happen. I'm able to set goals for myself and use my time to achieve them. I don't have to lie to people. I can look people in the eyes when I talk to them -- and when I realize I'm not, it means I'm not being honest, and I can catch it, and stop it. I've learned to be cautious of my character defects, as they will only come back to cause my grief when I do exercise them.\n\nIt would be so much to give up, to drink again. To lose all of my hobbies, my projects, my confidence, my health. And these are just the nice things that I've /gained back/. As a progressive disease, things are known to get *worse*. So, that place where I left off -- it was hitting women, losing my job, getting a DUI (or worse), and feeling completely uncomfortable with my own existence all the time. That guy was a fucking loser. I don't want to be him again.\n\nI hope this extended rant is valuable to someone. I guess my TL;DR is: if you're ready to quit drinking, you can do it. Go to AA (a lot). Make a plan for what you're going to do with all of your newly found free time. Make a plan for how you'll handle nervous and anxious energy, of which you'll have a boatload. Processing emotions will be a weird and uncomfortable new experience, but it gets easier the longer you don't drink.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "77za4b", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "999 Days of Sobriety on the Wall", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": 1508665016.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_77za4b", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/77za4b/999_days_of_sobriety_on_the_wall/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1508692880.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/77za4b/999_days_of_sobriety_on_the_wall/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "reddit-user-dude", "created_utc": 1508664080.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m worried I might be/be on the road to becoming an alcoholic.

He had said something to me (while drunk of course) that suggested to me he was having a problem but has never fully admitted it to me. So I began to observe him more and do my research. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He drinks every weekend, mostly one night (saturday) but on occasion both Friday and Saturday.  In the beginning I would drink with him too, I&amp;#39;m not able to go over every weekend so I won&amp;#39;t drink then but he still does. And he will still drink on the weekends that I&amp;#39;m with him and I don&amp;#39;t drink. He has told me he drinks alone as if it wasn&amp;#39;t something for me to concerned about. If there is a night during the week that I can come over he does not drink and so for the longest time I thought it was strictly the weekend for him and didn&amp;#39;t see it as too much of s cause for concern. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then he told me he has a high tolerance for beer and switches over to something harder later on. He will drink the whole pint. He convinced me it&amp;#39;s normal for him and that it doesn&amp;#39;t work like that for me because I don&amp;#39;t drink a lot. But it never seemed right and after he made the suggestion he may have s problem I did my research and saw that indeed it was not normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are certain days of the week (usually 2) that he won&amp;#39;t go into work. He tells me he works from home, or he is feeling anxiety, or he didn&amp;#39;t get enough sleep and takes the day off. What he doesn&amp;#39;t know is I found out he drinks the night before, during the week.  And I believe he skips work because he isn&amp;#39;t feeling well due to drinking the night before. He always tells me how he feels bad about missing work (he won&amp;#39;t tell be it&amp;#39;s because of alcohol obviously) and how that needs to stop. I also found out he can drink at least 3 night&amp;#39;s up to 5 night&amp;#39;s a week. The hard stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the signs I&amp;#39;ve observed in him is he has a &amp;quot;beer belly&amp;quot; that he is sensitive about, he lacks sexual desire and if we do become intimate he cannot perform as well as he should. The lack of intimacy, before I found out how much alcohol can play a part, has really messed with my self esteem. I wonder if he is attracted to me, if he is gay, if he&amp;#39;s not into me.....and it may still be all those things, but the alcohol makes some sense as to why this could be. The problem is that he subtly puts the intimacy issues on me because I feel like he can&amp;#39;t admit to me it may be due to alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I observed he joined an anonymous online support group, which made me happy. But then that weekend he got drunk, and I suspect he may have earlier this week too. I know joining a group isn&amp;#39;t going to magically make this condition go away, so I am not upset but I feel a sense of disappointment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The times he has told me how much he cares for me have been while drunk, he doesn&amp;#39;t compliment or tell me how he feels about me when sober. Although he does little things that show he cares, and responds to my affection even if he doesn&amp;#39;t initiate it. But a few months ago, while drunk again, he went to bed and left his music on the computer. I woke up as I had fallen asleep and got up to turn it off and saw he had been messaging sexual things to a other woman. A woman who I suspected was an ex due to seeing photos of them, who he told me previously (while drunk, and without me asking) that he wanted me to know she was just a friend. He messaged her while sober but not as frequently, and most of the messages are late at night. It killed me and I know I should have left or confronted him, but I have issues with confrontation and I decided to stay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, obviously he will lie while drunk. So it&amp;#39;s hard for me to figure out how he truly feels about me  since he&amp;#39;s only ever told me his feelings for me while drunk. Also, he has told some people online he is single who don&amp;#39;t know him personally and on his support group he lists the reasons why he wants to stop drinking and lists everything but a girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does drinking cause a lot of physical and emotional intimacy issues? Or is this a non alcohol issue and a fear of commitment? Is there a way I can show him I know subtly, and how much I care and want to help him? Is he a lost cause?

Here&amp;#39;s my summed up story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend of 2 years now has been an alcoholic for more than a decade.  My understanding of her history is that she drank massive quantities of vodka and beer for all of that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we first got together, she was capable and eager to drink a liter of vodka and a 30-pack of beers every 2 days.  I&amp;#39;ve been slowly working with her to reduce her alcohol intake, and I&amp;#39;ve had middling success.  She completely shuns the idea of attending AA, and although she was interested in attending an in-patient rehabilitation facility, we haven&amp;#39;t been able to find or afford such a thing.  Using my calculations of her spending on alcohol, I was able to convince her that she could at least go without vodka.  So instead she consumed more beers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She eventually suffered some health-related problems such as stomach pains and vague sicknesses, and every time she went to the ER she was told to stop drinking.  There was this one time she took a medicine for a week which made her nauseated by alcohol, and she was like a completely changed woman.  She had focus and poise like I had never seen from her, but she commented that she was tired and bored.  Once the medicine was gone, she went right back to drinking beer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago, she suffered more health problems that caused ER visits.  So she renewed her effort to drink less, but it didn&amp;#39;t work out for her because she ended up on some of the worst binges I&amp;#39;ve ever seen from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was around this time that I had to leave the country on military business.  Right before I had to fly off, she had another medical situation that landed her in the ER.  She was diagnosed with gastritis and potentially stomach ulcers.  She ended up getting some medication for her stomach but she took it with alcohol and it caused her to fearfully hallucinate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever since that terrible day, she has made great strides in her efforts to reduce her drinking.  With regular Skype calls I got to watch her change into a more measured woman with intellect and beauty.  Her facial features even seemed to change somehow, I can&amp;#39;t explain exactly what I mean by that but she looked more beautiful and just sharper somehow.  And she has gotten back into some old hobbies of hers, such as drawing and painting.  It has been an amazing transformation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she continues to backslide and drink, both behind my back and in front of me.  I can tell right away by her voice and tone when she has been drinking.  She recently decided to just be honest with me and drank several beers in front of me on camera.  I don&amp;#39;t know how to handle that other than just hang up, but I really miss her and I wish she would just get this out of her system.  And I definitely harbor anger and frustration towards her.  She gives me lots of excuses like, &amp;quot;You have to let me do this at my own pace!!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;If I completely stopped, I might die!!&amp;quot;  She told me the other day that I&amp;#39;m narcissistic because I am not thinking more sensitively of her situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday she admitted that she was drinking wine because &amp;quot;it helps her draw&amp;quot;.  But later that night, she ended up back in the hospital with stomach pains and I can only assume it&amp;#39;s from the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is my long-winded post.  My question is...when is enough enough?  Am I not being supportive?  I&amp;#39;ve been quietly pressuring her to mitigate her drinking.  I&amp;#39;ve been very careful not to be threatening or give ultimatums or things that could give me a negative reaction.  But I&amp;#39;m honestly sick of it.

I married my husband about 6 months ago we have been together for almost 5 years. When we started dating we were both young and used to party a lot, as we grew older, we both do it much less. When he gets drunk he tends to go into almost a blackout state, and acts like a different person, not really abusive but almost manic. He has bipolar/schizophrenia that runs in his family so it always used to worry me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His best friend is an alcoholic who nearly lost his job and currently 100% sober. My husband realizes he has a problem but he does not qualify himself as a &amp;#39;full blown&amp;#39; alcoholic. He does not drink often but when he does, it is very hard for him to stop, and he descends into this crazy manic person who he or I have no control over. We have had a few major incidents, once when we were still dating, he came home at 4 am drunk and high, and threw a beer can at my face, leaving a slight cut. I tried to leave him then but once he sobered up he apologized said he didn&amp;#39;t remember anything, promised to never do it again. Once we were engaged and on a weekend away, we were drinking at the hotel bar and I left early because he wanted &amp;#39;one more drink&amp;#39;, I went upstairs fell asleep for about two hours, when I woke up he was still not back. I went downstairs and he had been drinking alone all this time, refused to come upstairs, made a huge scene in the hotel lobby etc. He tried to hug me upstairs, and I pushed him off me, and he punched me in the kidneys, leaving a slight bruise. Again next morning, very apologetic promised he would control his drinking etc, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Latest big incident was about a year ago, when he got wasted at a work party, pounding whiskey and wine non stop, and acted like a fool infant of his employers, one of his colleagues took him aside the next day and told him how he acted was very inappropriate. I was so embarrassed that I left the work party early and he stayed back and continued drinking and someone else had to drive him home. After this incident he was very remorseful, part of me thinks he never believed me when I told him about his behavior during his blackouts, but coming from a third party and a work colleague he respected he said he was going to change. He tried going to AA once but the meeting had been cancelled so he never tried going again. He stopped drinking for about 2 months completely until Thanksgiving or so and even then his drinking was controlled. We have tried numerous methods like drink limit, no liquor, only beer etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The work incident was a year ago and since then we have had no &amp;#39;major&amp;#39; incidents and now I feel like he is getting complacent and comfortable again.

Yesterday we were meeting some friends for dinner, we both started drinking early afternoon but I stopped pretty early but he continued drinking well into the night and started getting very loud, cursing during dinner, and even though he knew I was getting upset, kept pounding drinks all night, after every drink he would say &amp;#39;this is my last&amp;#39; but then kept drinking. I was very upset at him and looking back this morning I am embarrassed about how both of us acted in front of our friends, him being a drunken fool and me being a bitch.

A little over a year ago I went to a music festival. I drank a lot, no drugs. 2 days in, in the middle of the hot day, I became very ill. Immediately went back to my hotel and waited in sheer, destructive panic and anxiety, I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep, eat, or even thinking about drinking water because I just wanted it to go away, to sleep it off. The festival went on, I was in my hotel, hoping to fall asleep but didn&amp;#39;t. 10am comes, I wake up my drunken friend, who got back super late, so I had to make the 2hr drive back home. It was miserable. No sleep, same anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made it back to town, exhausted, but couldn&amp;#39;t sleep. There was something severely wrong with me and I had no clue what it was. Went to a clinic that day, suffered through the waiting time. I thought it was simply anxiety. The walk in doc prescribed me anxiety meds. I took them later that night, feeling relieved that it might be over. Nope. After an attempt to fall asleep, my delusional mind echoed &amp;quot; Dehydration!? You feel sick to the idea of drinking water and your piss is orange!?&amp;quot; The same friend mentioned earlier drove me there. I forced myself to drink water and came back home shortly after. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR\nTHAT NEW FEELING STILL LINGERS TODAY, OVER A YEAR LATER. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t drink a lot the week after. But had a few &amp;quot;jolts. &amp;quot; One was during a date which sucked so much ass. The same anxiety creeped its way in as soon as we got to the restaurant. Not as severely as the dehydration accident, but it was very uncomfortable. Since then, it&amp;#39;s happened here and there. But I was always able to control it, which is silly to begin with as I&amp;#39;ve never had this problem until then.  Here I am today. Sick of the random moments of panic for no uninspired reason.

I want to quit drinking but I&amp;#39;m almost afraid to at this point because I don&amp;#39;t get anxious at all when drunk. But most importantly, I drink often, and this symptom only occurs when sober, which causes me to run home, then drink to calm down. If I quit, suffer through the first few days, will this anxiety go away? Or could it be something else? I&amp;#39;m hoping for a scientific explanation.

When I refer to drinking, I mean having hard liquor - I&amp;#39;m not a big wine/beer fan and I prefer having Rum and Coke or Vodka and Coke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was about 16 years old, I started drinking for the first time, and mostly in secret. I would drink about once a week - usually even less - but I would get pretty drunk each time. I was never caught and I never did anything crazy, so I&amp;#39;d say that I had some self-control and was in a good environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around 18, I got a fake ID which with I used to buy alcohol for not just myself, but also friends. I did this throughout my senior year of high school so the drinking increased as I was invited to more events (parties) as a responsible alcohol supplier. At this point, I was drinking once or twice a week - if even - but I never really felt the need to drink. It wasn&amp;#39;t debilitating at any point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Freshman and Sophomore year of college were pretty much the same, but with more drinking - I&amp;#39;d end up drinking 3-4 days a week and get pretty drunk each time. My friends and I are part of the Honors Program, and though I usually ended up drinking more than them (higher tolerance + drinking on different days with various friend groups), I managed keeping my grades up, still had good relationships with friends that didn&amp;#39;t always involve drinking, had a girlfriend, and found good internships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, when I interned and lived in New York City over the summer, the drinking increased a lot to 6 days a week.

When I refer to drinking, I mean having hard liquor - I'm not a big wine/beer fan and I prefer having Rum and Coke or Vodka and Coke.\n\n\nWhen I was about 16 years old, I started drinking for the first time, and mostly in secret. I would drink about once a week - usually even less - but I would get pretty drunk each time. I was never caught and I never did anything crazy, so I'd say that I had some self-control and was in a good environment.\n\n\nAround 18, I got a fake ID which with I used to buy alcohol for not just myself, but also friends. I did this throughout my senior year of high school so the drinking increased as I was invited to more events (parties) as a responsible alcohol supplier. At this point, I was drinking once or twice a week - if even - but I never really felt the need to drink. It wasn't debilitating at any point.\n\n\nMy Freshman and Sophomore year of college were pretty much the same, but with more drinking - I'd end up drinking 3-4 days a week and get pretty drunk each time. My friends and I are part of the Honors Program, and though I usually ended up drinking more than them (higher tolerance + drinking on different days with various friend groups), I managed keeping my grades up, still had good relationships with friends that didn't always involve drinking, had a girlfriend, and found good internships.\n\n\nHowever, when I interned and lived in New York City over the summer, the drinking increased a lot to 6 days a week. I was still able to fairly well at work and workout at the gym, but almost every day was Happy Hour with someone else and then clubbing, more bars, or drinking at an apartment afterwards.\n\n\nI'm in my Junior year of college and though I'm currently able to stop myself from drinking during the school week, I've found that I can't stop drinking on the weekends - I just feel the need to get super drunk. I don't want to do it to lose control, but I just feel \"Why not? Why not drink another shot? I'm still coherent so we can drink some more!\" Or, \"A glass of Rum and Coke is a good way to relax/do work/watch a movie\" (pretty much what people say, but about wine).\n\n\nI still want to say that I don't feel like drinking gets in the way of friendships, but a lot of that does revolve around drinking.\nNow, I can finish 0.5-0.6L of vodka/rum (35-40% liquor) in a night without eating hours before and barely feel the effects. Part of me is worried about this, but is it that bad?\nAm I even addicted if I can stop drinking for 5 days in a row? I'd try to go longer, but every weekend is like a party weekend and drinking is very common before/during going out.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts? And what are your tips for reducing the amount I drink? I don't mind having a beer with friends (instead of say, having water), but I can't stop myself from going for the harder liquors or more and more beers.\n\nEdit: I'm now 20 years old (almost 21), and I haven't gone more than a week without drinking at all since I was 18. I've probably drunk (on average) 2-4 days a week since I was 18, but possibly even more now - I'm thinking 3-4 days a week.\n\nI still have no (physical/physiological) changes: no shaking/problems on days I don't drink, I still have a healthy friendship group, I haven't made any bad irrational decisions or been caught with anything, and I'm able to exercise, do well in school, and intern at awesome places over the summer.

I&amp;#39;m also highly depressed, (clinically diagnosed) with severe anxiety as well as PTSD. I use to be in the military and after deployment, I fell into alcohol. I&amp;#39;ve drunk...every day. I drown my unhappiness in alcohol and my partner never knew until last night when he questioned me and I lied.\nCase in point, he found out, can&amp;#39;t trust me, knows I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic and I&amp;#39;ve lied to him constantly about it before. So it&amp;#39;s why he can&amp;#39;t trust me. This happened two nights ago. And the following morning after sleeping separately, he wouldn&amp;#39;t even look at me.\nHe is literally everything to me and I don&amp;#39;t know what else to do? He says I remind him too much of his childhood where his parents were drug users and alcoholics. And he doesn&amp;#39;t want to associate himself with that anymore, it&amp;#39;s why he left that life and moved away. Now, I&amp;#39;m just bringing it back. We talked that morning because I didn&amp;#39;t want to drive myself crazy with anxiety if he wanted to kick me out or break up once I got back home from school and work.\nHe said if this is the calling to make me change, to cut off alcohol, and slowly work on getting help, (Going to AA) he would try to help.

I'm also highly depressed, (clinically diagnosed) with severe anxiety as well as PTSD. I use to be in the military and after deployment, I fell into alcohol. I've drunk...every day. I drown my unhappiness in alcohol and my partner never knew until last night when he questioned me and I lied.\nCase in point, he found out, can't trust me, knows I'm an alcoholic and I've lied to him constantly about it before. So it's why he can't trust me. This happened two nights ago. And the following morning after sleeping separately, he wouldn't even look at me.\nHe is literally everything to me and I don't know what else to do? He says I remind him too much of his childhood where his parents were drug users and alcoholics. And he doesn't want to associate himself with that anymore, it's why he left that life and moved away. Now, I'm just bringing it back. We talked that morning because I didn't want to drive myself crazy with anxiety if he wanted to kick me out or break up once I got back home from school and work.\nHe said if this is the calling to make me change, to cut off alcohol, and slowly work on getting help, (Going to AA) he would try to help.

I will also not be providing ages, names, or locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a long and troubled history with alcohol. A number of &amp;quot;very bad things&amp;quot; have happened to me when in conjunction with alcohol; some of these things are through my own fault, a larger number of others were not. As such, I very seldom drink, and when I do, I only do it with people I feel implicitly safe with. Even then, I limit myself to two beer, or maybe a cocktail, a couple of shots. Once I start to feel the buzz, or tipsy, I stop. I cannot recollect the last time I was well and truly drunk, and that is not a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within the last few years, my long-term marriage dissolved and I have been single since that time. I have not dated anyone, I have not gone looking for anyone. It has been lonely, but it was necessary. I have taken time to heal from that failed relationship and I have gone to counseling to battle my past demons. I feel confident that although those skeletons are rattling around in my closet, I can face them if I need to, but most of the time I tell them to be quiet and go about my life as though they no longer control me, because they don&amp;#39;t.\nWhile with my ex, I met someone online who shared many of the same interests as I do. We had the same sense of humor, the same outlook on life. We have been online friends for almost a decade. When my marriage broke up, this person was there for me as a friend and encouraged me and basically was &amp;quot;that guy&amp;quot; you could turn to for help if you ever needed to talk or if you needed a bit of validation. We&amp;#39;d spoken on the phone a handful of times within the past year, if we were bored or needed some companionship. I never entertained any notion of ever starting a relationship with them; that&amp;#39;s crazy. The reason it&amp;#39;s crazy is because we live over 1k miles from each other, as the crow flies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, one night, I was hanging out at a buddy&amp;#39;s, having showed up at his door with some pizza and my buddy offered me a couple of beer. No prob, I know my limits. I drank those beer and ate my pizza, and the whole time, this other person was on my mind, so I started texting them. Flirty texting, etc. It was getting late, so I excused myself and came home (walking distance, no driving involved). I then called up my long-distance friend, and basically... I realized all at once what had been staring me in the face for years. This person was in love with me, and I think maybe I might be in love with them too. This was about a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both agree that having any semblance of a normal relationship is a moot point right now. I have ties here, they have ties there. I also learned that they have a couple of driving things they need to sort out, etc. For the time being, we&amp;#39;ve just been having fun flirting, texting, v-chatting.. All hours of the night. We talk on the phone every single day, for at least 3 or 4 hours, upwards of 8 hours a day. They have offered to pay my airfare to come visit them as soon as I am able. My heart aches when I can&amp;#39;t speak to them. I spend every waking moment wondering what they are doing, where they are, who they&amp;#39;re with, if they&amp;#39;re happy, how they&amp;#39;re feeling... It&amp;#39;s completely blown up and despite my best judgment, I haven&amp;#39;t really been trying to control it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About a week into talking to them on the phone, I noticed that they were making comments about being a &amp;quot;raging alcoholic&amp;quot; and that sometimes, their speech would be slurry and hard to make out. I laughed about it, because my other buddy (who is the one who gave me beers to compliment my pizza) is a functional alcoholic, and as long as you don&amp;#39;t hurt anyone and know your limit, I don&amp;#39;t care. As I&amp;#39;ve said, I don&amp;#39;t drink very often and I know my limit. I guess I just expect others to do so as well. Over time, I learned that this person drinks to excess every single day. They&amp;#39;ll excuse themselves from our conversation, and then about 20-30 minutes after they return, they are sloshed, incoherent, unresponsive, and a bit of an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised by an abusive alcoholic who did unspeakable things to me, physically and emotionally. I&amp;#39;ve sought out treatment and shoved that skeleton back in my closet where it belongs and where it can&amp;#39;t hurt me. I have since cut ties with my family because they refused to take ownership of the &amp;quot;very bad things&amp;quot; that happened to me when I was a child, all of which were directly caused by them. I have told my LD buddy all about the traumas I have endured. This is not common knowledge to many of my friends, but I felt that if I truly loved this person, they deserved to know about those things that shaped me into the person I am today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, my LD friend and I were on the phone. Some weird shit happened and some strange noises were going on and for all intents and purposes, I thought they were dying. I contacted one of their other friends and they went and checked up on my friend. They had just blacked out drunk on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came to learn that this person has some health problems which made them unable to be physically sick to their stomach, and as such, what I heard was their body trying to throw up, but being unable to. This person passed out from alcohol poisoning whilst on the phone with me, and I was completely helpless to do anything about it. Their body literally has no choice but to metabolize the alcohol and suffer through it. I haven&amp;#39;t slept right since. (FYI: I literally died in the ER from alcohol poisoning when I was a teenager. Flatlined, lights out. Clinically dead. By the grace of whatever passes for a god, I was revived with little to no brain damage, and am alive to write this tale.)\nWhen I try to talk to them about it, they act like it&amp;#39;s not a big deal. &amp;quot;I refuse to die because of something my brain thinks is inconsequential&amp;quot;, is what they told me. They went and stayed with family who refuse to let them drink. It was a rough couple of days for them but I felt confident that after 2 days, they&amp;#39;d be able to better fight it. Lo and behold, like a true addict, once they got back to their place, the booze came out and they buried themselves deep in the bottle. It&amp;#39;s been every day, even on days when they promise me they wouldn&amp;#39;t drink because I needed to tell them something very important and that to at least wait until I got the chance to call. I call. They&amp;#39;re sloshed at 3pm in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to cut this short and get to the point, I feel like this person doesn&amp;#39;t really want to get help. This person is looking for validation from me, which I unequivocally WILL NOT give them, for their drinking. They talk about going back to AA, going to see a therapist, going and dumping out the bottles and ignoring the liquor store around the corner from them... But I really know down in my heart that it&amp;#39;s a lie. I want so much for us to have a future, but I can&amp;#39;t be with an alcoholic. I can&amp;#39;t be with someone who will never have my back, will never be there for me in times of crises.... In some ways, I feel like the long-distance aspect of our relationship is a severe detriment to this situation because I cannot physically be there for them, in good and bad times. I can&amp;#39;t take the bottle away. I can&amp;#39;t entertain them in person. And I think, sadly, for that reason, it&amp;#39;s allowing them to believe that they can get away with hurting me, because no matter how many times they hear my voice, or see me in v-chat.. I&amp;#39;m just a face behind a screen. And that kills me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read, thank you. Any advice would be appreciated. I don&amp;#39;t know how I&amp;#39;m gonna dig myself out of this because in all truth, I LOVE this person for who they are when they are sober. They KILL me with laughter and light... But that darkness and sadness that rears its ugly head when they are drinking is killing whatever chance for a relationship we might have... I guess I am just looking for help in determining how much is too much, how long is too long... How do I know it&amp;#39;s enough?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;** EDITED FOR FORMATING ** &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "** Also posted in AlAnon sub ** \n\nThis is a throwaway account in order to protect myself and those I am about to discuss. I will also not be providing ages, names, or locations.\n\nPersonally, I have a long and troubled history with alcohol. A number of \"very bad things\" have happened to me when in conjunction with alcohol; some of these things are through my own fault, a larger number of others were not. As such, I very seldom drink, and when I do, I only do it with people I feel implicitly safe with. Even then, I limit myself to two beer, or maybe a cocktail, a couple of shots. Once I start to feel the buzz, or tipsy, I stop. I cannot recollect the last time I was well and truly drunk, and that is not a metaphor.\n\nWithin the last few years, my long-term marriage dissolved and I have been single since that time. I have not dated anyone, I have not gone looking for anyone. It has been lonely, but it was necessary. I have taken time to heal from that failed relationship and I have gone to counseling to battle my past demons. I feel confident that although those skeletons are rattling around in my closet, I can face them if I need to, but most of the time I tell them to be quiet and go about my life as though they no longer control me, because they don't.\nWhile with my ex, I met someone online who shared many of the same interests as I do. We had the same sense of humor, the same outlook on life. We have been online friends for almost a decade. When my marriage broke up, this person was there for me as a friend and encouraged me and basically was \"that guy\" you could turn to for help if you ever needed to talk or if you needed a bit of validation. We'd spoken on the phone a handful of times within the past year, if we were bored or needed some companionship. I never entertained any notion of ever starting a relationship with them; that's crazy. The reason it's crazy is because we live over 1k miles from each other, as the crow flies.\n\nWell, one night, I was hanging out at a buddy's, having showed up at his door with some pizza and my buddy offered me a couple of beer. No prob, I know my limits. I drank those beer and ate my pizza, and the whole time, this other person was on my mind, so I started texting them. Flirty texting, etc. It was getting late, so I excused myself and came home (walking distance, no driving involved). I then called up my long-distance friend, and basically... I realized all at once what had been staring me in the face for years. This person was in love with me, and I think maybe I might be in love with them too. This was about a month ago.\n\nWe both agree that having any semblance of a normal relationship is a moot point right now. I have ties here, they have ties there.

Not enough to have a physical dependency on alcohol, but enough to work hard at destroying my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway so there it was, I had sent a message to an ex-friend, a straight guy who is one of the nicest guys you could meet. I felt it appropriate in my drunken state to blab on about how I &amp;#39;miss him&amp;#39; and to tell him that I&amp;#39;ve been seeing a guy for a few months now (my longest &amp;#39;relationship&amp;#39; in years). I even called this guy my &amp;#39;boyfriend&amp;#39;, which is a stretch at best. Anyway it was all the usual crap &amp;quot;look I have a boyfriend now, so I&amp;#39;m all fixed!&amp;quot; I also sent a message to another ex-friend, some line from some song we listened to together once whilst &amp;#39;bonding&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These guys were close friends, well they weren&amp;#39;t really because I shut people out and never put in the effort required to maintain a friendship, but they were certainly two of my most favourite people. Now they don&amp;#39;t speak to me, and I don&amp;#39;t speak to them. In fact I feel like fainting whenever we are in the same room (we go to uni together, but don&amp;#39;t see each other much as we are in different years). I still have one &amp;#39;favourite&amp;#39; person left, but even she&amp;#39;s starting to give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is these two guys were once my housemates, and we were in the same year. Though through systematic self-destruction I ruined all that. I fucked up academically and had to repeat the year. I still lived with them that year, and another, so three years total.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any event, I carried on my binge drinking behaviour, and was the worst housemate you can think of. I&amp;#39;d stumble in at early hours, wake them up, piss in places pee shouldn&amp;#39;t be, I&amp;#39;d even steal their alcohol if I&amp;#39;d ran out and wanted to carry on. I&amp;#39;d promise to replace it, sometimes I would... but mostly I wouldn&amp;#39;t, as I became too broke. They had to start locking any of their booze away in their rooms. I think sometimes if they had eaten something and forgotten it, or misplaced change or something, they&amp;#39;d think that was me too. It never was, I was only interested in staying drunk when I was already drunk, and they never accused me, but I think inside they thought I was a thief in that way too. What would I even say if they had accused me? How would I have any credibility since I admitted to stealing their beer, or vodka?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was worse to one of them (the guy I text). I had a terrible crush on him (probably still do) and because he was too nice a guy to punch my face in and was always forgiving me and trying to help me, I&amp;#39;d get drunk and throw myself at him. I&amp;#39;d literally say the most awful shit, saying I could suck him off and that it &amp;quot;feels good from guys!&amp;quot;, and trying to get into his room or into his bed at 3am so often he had to sleep with his bedroom door locked, plus the aforementioned nude pictures... He&amp;#39;s completely straight, and has a long term girlfriend of many years (who is also lovely), so what fantasy my drunk brain had concocted to make me think he&amp;#39;d one day say &amp;#39;yes!&amp;#39; is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway they (and my other housemates) forgave me so often it&amp;#39;s not even funny. But obviously I wasn&amp;#39;t satisfied until I&amp;#39;d destroyed my friendships completely. They quietly arranged a place to live themselves this year, and I live with new people now (who also are lovely, and whom haven&amp;#39;t seen me drunk, and nor do I hope they will).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been so bad with the binges the last year and it got to the point where it looked like my friends had forgiven me. In the end though my lying to them is what blew it, either directly (I&amp;#39;d say I was doing well at uni, when I wasn&amp;#39;t, and they were supportive and proud, then they found out). Or indirectly by hiding and being secretive. It got to the point that when I was sober I would just act as though nothing had happened; I&amp;#39;d avoid them or just try and hide and be secretive. I didn&amp;#39;t even come out of my room the last months I lived there, and at that point I wasn&amp;#39;t even drinking. I&amp;#39;d wake up super early to leave for uni, and only eat really late at night, didn&amp;#39;t even have the balls to apologise by that point. I think their cutting of ties with me (most of the knots I cut myself) is a combination of anger, and despair at being unable to watch someone throw away their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, after my most recent &amp;#39;binge&amp;#39; after a couple of months sober or drinking &amp;#39;normally&amp;#39; I have decided that I just should not drink at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am living at the accommodation provided by my university placement at the moment, most go home at the weekends, but I like being here at the weekends as it feels &amp;#39;university like&amp;#39; and so encourages me to do the study and exercise I mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a difficulty though as at weekends I have the place to myself and 2 days of no commitment, so the temptation to go out and buy alcohol is there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I write this story now, at the start of the day, and hope that by checking in throughout the day for any words of encouragement you might have, will help me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s my story. I&amp;#39;ve barely admitted it to myself before, much less written it down for others, but I hope it is useful to others. I&amp;#39;m off for my jog now! I&amp;#39;ll check in this evening. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I miss my friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will not drink today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I write this at 6am on a Saturday as I have just woken up, and this is the first place I come to read stories of success for motivation, and to see if I can offer help to anyone.

They quietly arranged a place to live themselves this year, and I live with new people now (who also are lovely, and whom haven't seen me drunk, and nor do I hope they will).\n\nI haven't been so bad with the binges the last year and it got to the point where it looked like my friends had forgiven me. In the end though my lying to them is what blew it, either directly (I'd say I was doing well at uni, when I wasn't, and they were supportive and proud, then they found out). Or indirectly by hiding and being secretive. It got to the point that when I was sober I would just act as though nothing had happened; I'd avoid them or just try and hide and be secretive. I didn't even come out of my room the last months I lived there, and at that point I wasn't even drinking. I'd wake up super early to leave for uni, and only eat really late at night, didn't even have the balls to apologise by that point. I think their cutting of ties with me (most of the knots I cut myself) is a combination of anger, and despair at being unable to watch someone throw away their life.\n\nThat said, after my most recent 'binge' after a couple of months sober or drinking 'normally' I have decided that I just should not drink at all. \n\nI am living at the accommodation provided by my university placement at the moment, most go home at the weekends, but I like being here at the weekends as it feels 'university like' and so encourages me to do the study and exercise I mentioned before.\n\nThere is a difficulty though as at weekends I have the place to myself and 2 days of no commitment, so the temptation to go out and buy alcohol is there.\n\nI write this story now, at the start of the day, and hope that by checking in throughout the day for any words of encouragement you might have, will help me. \n\nSo that's my story. I've barely admitted it to myself before, much less written it down for others, but I hope it is useful to others. I'm off for my jog now! I'll check in this evening. Thanks for reading.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI miss my friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI will not drink today.\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "74t74o", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "3 weeks today... again.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 5, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_74t74o", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/74t74o/3_weeks_today_again/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1507384117.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/74t74o/3_weeks_today_again/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Adam657", "created_utc": 1507355317.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now look where I am now.

He can&amp;#39;t stop. When we first started dating he would drink and it was no big deal, the longer we were together, the more the drinking became an issue. He would wake me up in the middle of the night to accuse me of outlandish things, like cheating on him with friends. He would shake me and yell at me, waking me up, to ask me questions about things like: &amp;quot;where did this &lt;em&gt;random object&lt;/em&gt; come from?! It looks like &lt;em&gt;instert random male friends name&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt;, I saw it in a picture of him on Facebook! You had him here didn&amp;#39;t you?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I would cry and become confused because how do you answer a question to something that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense? Where did that thing come from? That person was never in my house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then it became such a problem that I cut all my male friends out of my life. Then he would apologize the next day and say it was because of something I did that made him think I was cheating on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He recently broke up with me, right after a hurricane had hit our city and I was without power, while his apartment did have power, and he left me alone, in a house with no power, and proceeded to drink with his roommates while I was home alone, in the dark, post-hurricane. A few days later, when I refused to call him and talk to him, he apologized and told me he had contacted his father and step-mother for support in getting him into rehab for his drinking. That was about 2-3 weeks ago. He has since done nothing towards going to rehab. He makes excuses, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t go to an inpatient treatment, I don&amp;#39;t have money, I can&amp;#39;t miss work, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s that bad&amp;quot; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His mother was an addict and took her life around 2 years ago, she also had mental health issues, and his father is a chronic drinker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I try to break up with him, or when he breaks up with me, he always comes over crying, apologizing, saying he will change and get help, and nothing ever happens. It&amp;#39;s been about two years of this back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another factor is that he has hidden his drinking from me before, for long periods of time. So when he says he has stopped, I believe him, but it always turns out to be a lie, EVERY TIME. I want to give him the benefit of doubt because I want it to be true, but days, weeks, months later he is back to his weird behavior and accusations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do I start? What should I do? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need some reassurance of the right thing to do. I have tried just ending it, he always apologizes and wiggles his way back into my life because I CAN&amp;#39;T SAY NO TO HIM. I don&amp;#39;t need him at all, I am completely content alone, I have a career that takes up enough of my time to keep myself occupied, I have family who are always there for me, I do not need him.

So my strategy was, and I wanted to check here to see if this is some know fallible rationalization, I should stop drinking beer. I tried that today, no beer. Long, miserable day as a result, just couldn&amp;#39;t get into anything that I normally enjoy. I figured the first step in a solution would be to get vodka instead, because I feel like I&amp;#39;d drink a significant amount less of it than I could of beer, because I think &amp;quot;oh it&amp;#39;s just beer, I can have just ONE more&amp;quot; but they add up, and it&amp;#39;s a slippery slope. My suspicion is that a more potent abv beverage such as a hard liquor would be different, but I can so easily see myself here with the bottle rationalizing just one more swig, just to prolong the drunk a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; longer. I know very well how the human mind works with addiction, I have recovered from a few much more difficult substances and it wasn&amp;#39;t exactly a walk in the park. Thoughts?

I noticed more and more until it hit me a few weeks ago, I actually stopped and counted and drank of 20 ~12 bottles of beer (~9% abv) and still barely felt different. I wasn't necessarily drinking to feel different. Now when I don't drink I shiver, diarrhea, vomit, just feel lifeless, obvious early signs of alcoholism. So my strategy was, and I wanted to check here to see if this is some know fallible rationalization, I should stop drinking beer. I tried that today, no beer. Long, miserable day as a result, just couldn't get into anything that I normally enjoy. I figured the first step in a solution would be to get vodka instead, because I feel like I'd drink a significant amount less of it than I could of beer, because I think \"oh it's just beer, I can have just ONE more\" but they add up, and it's a slippery slope. My suspicion is that a more potent abv beverage such as a hard liquor would be different, but I can so easily see myself here with the bottle rationalizing just one more swig, just to prolong the drunk a *little* longer. I know very well how the human mind works with addiction, I have recovered from a few much more difficult substances and it wasn't exactly a walk in the park. Thoughts?

Isolates himself while working online in AA steps and seems passive aggressive towards me wanting to work on myself. Plus nightly pity parties.\n\nHe likes to tell me what I should be doing to try and save our marriage but won't take the steps himself. I am going to see a counselor for myself soon. Our marriage is in limbo. Which just fuels things.\n\nSorry for the ramble but what it boils down to for me is, I still feel manipulated and taken advantage of while I feel like he is only going through the motions and still placing blame. I don't want to question is recovery though but not seeing changes. Any thoughts or advice?\n\nTL;DR - Am I right to belive my husband isn't really in recovery or am I needing to mind my own business?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "7338m5", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Now what?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_7338m5", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/7338m5/now_what/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1506662856.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/7338m5/now_what/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Faultsallmine4ever", "created_utc": 1506634056.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I am currently 21 years old.

He also takes Adderall, Xanax, and Hydrocodone. These meds are prescribed and he claims he is taking them as prescribed. You know, other than the mixing with alcohol part. He has fallen down in front of our 16 yo son on a few occasions. He is often in a drunken stupor and looks like a wide-eyed maniac. On occasion he says he knows he drinks too much, but he refuses to go to rehab bc of his career. Also, he flat out said he would never give up drinking during hunting season. I love him. He is a good man and has been through a lot (cancer twice, parents dying, brother breaking the law and embarrassing the family name, stressful job,etc.). But enough is enough. Our daughter is in college and lives away from home. She doesn&amp;#39;t see how bad it has gotten. He hung the moon in her eyes. My son is not so blind. He makes comments and asks questions. My husband is never violent, but he can be mean and tries to pick fights when he is drunk. My son has even had to intervene on occasion. I don&amp;#39;t want that for my son. He gets embarrassed and he watches every move his dad makes with nervous tension. My husband is not aware of this at all. He thinks my son and I gang up on him. I guess we do in a sense bc we often look at each other and roll our eyes when he does stuff. Please advise me on what to do. Oh, i also found a marijuana pipe in his backpack.

But i felt i should put forward the specific case of my brother who is struggling from alcoholism. I will summarize what all has happened till now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brother has been drinking alcohol daily for atleast 1 year. (thats what he has admitted and we have no way to verify it). He drinks whiskey most of the time and the daily amount is equal or above 180ml and this quantity is higher on weekends &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has gone through breakup of his engagement twice and his marriage is in jeopardy. All of this has happened because he has said unwanted things to them while being drunk.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His job is also in danger because he has been irregular to office.

But i felt i should put forward the specific case of my brother who is struggling from alcoholism. I will summarize what all has happened till now. \n\nBrother has been drinking alcohol daily for atleast 1 year. (thats what he has admitted and we have no way to verify it). He drinks whiskey most of the time and the daily amount is equal or above 180ml and this quantity is higher on weekends \n\nHe has gone through breakup of his engagement twice and his marriage is in jeopardy. All of this has happened because he has said unwanted things to them while being drunk.\u00a0\n\n\nHis job is also in danger because he has been irregular to office. Now when we try to reason with him by telling him the consequences of alcoholism he accepts it. He also agrees that alcoholism is the reason for his present condition. But he quits alcohol for 2-3 days and then drinks again. When we caught him with alcohol bottle and asked him to not drink it he became violent and started to argue and finally drank.\u00a0\n\n\nTill now he has been saying if his wife comes back again in his life he will quit drinking.

Ever since I was a child he has been an alcoholic, but a functional one. I remember that before he would mostly drink on the weekends and some weeknights. It slowly escalated and he started to drink every single night but he would at least be sober during the day. We used to live in New York (state) and in July of 2008 my mother, sister and I came to Mexico to live while he stayed back to work. This year, in June, he finally came to live with us. During those years he worked in order to buy us a couple of houses here and a car. He also saved up enough to open his own shop since he is a mechanic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, before I get into more details I want to go over the process of his alcoholism. When we lived with him in NY I remember asking him more than a few times to stop drinking and sometimes he would just dismiss my begging and others he would make a small effort of about two weeks but he has never managed to go any longer than that. When we moved and he stayed by himself he would oscilate between mostly drinking on the weekend, to drinking every night. There was one period though that he would completely lose himself and we wouldn&amp;#39;t hear from him for days. Then, he went back to mostly only drinking every night. He always went to regular check ups and at one moment which I believe was in April of this year, some tests came back that showed his liver was having some problems. He really tried and he was sober for two weeks. He got drunk one weekend but then went another week without drinking and repeated the process. At first I thought this time was the last one. I filled my own head with false hope. As soon as he knew he was fine again, he went back to his usual routine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, back to the present. He came here in June and at first he would drink daily but only at night. When my grandparents would come over, he didn&amp;#39;t drink. Something between my parents happened and he got very upset. They supposedly managed to work it out but now every time my mom tried to talk with him about his problem he brings it up and tells her it&amp;#39;s her fault that he is like this. The thing is, he always finds something to blame it on. Before they got into said fight, he would drink because the change was too big and he was worried. When I was a child his excuse was that he deserved it for working so hard to feed us. He picks something to make others feel guilty so they &amp;quot;accept&amp;quot; his drinking. Things have gotten worse. As time has gone by he started drinking daily but had a few moments of sobriety. However, not even visits from my grandparents stopped him anymore. The worst had been this week because he has completely drowned himself in alcohol and hasn&amp;#39;t had a single lucid moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father has always been an agressive drunk. Never physically abusive in any way but I have come to the painful realization that he does verbally and emotionally abuse us. I stay locked inside my room and I don&amp;#39;t want to go out of it because I don&amp;#39;t want to face him drunk. I remember my dad. He is not a bad man. When he was sober before he was very different. He has always had a short temper but when he was sober he not once insulted us, at least that I can remember. But lately even when he is sober I can tell the alcohol has done it&amp;#39;s damage. He is still a good man but I have noticed slight changes in his attitude. This week has been overwhelming for my sister, mother and I. I know I can leave whenever I want because I have people who are ready to help me but I don&amp;#39;t want to leave my mom or sister alone. My sister is only 14, she is going through adolescence which is already hard enough. I want to be there for her the way no one was there for me. I am not ready to leave her alone to face these problems herself but I can&amp;#39;t handle it anymore. I have had mental issues before, unknown to my family so I have a hard time coping with stressful situations sometimes. I&amp;#39;ve been fine for years but since he has come back I have been on edge and the physical manifestations of my issues are coming back. I have gastrointestinal issues, as well as constant headaches. I don&amp;#39;t want to leave them and in truth, even if I have given up on my father changing,  I still love him. I want him to stop killing himself slowly. What worries me is that as I said before, he was starting to have health issues and whatever progress he made is definitely undone. His liver is probably having issues again and he hasn&amp;#39;t gone to the doctor once. I just don&amp;#39;t want to lose him either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past I have some everything. I talked calmly, I cried, I begged, I yelled. I tried every single way of talking with him and it has had no effect. You may wonder why I still want to help him if he has emotionally hurt me my entire life. Well, I wonder too. I am so close to losing all faith. I guess in the ends , it&amp;#39;s because he is my father and because I know he is not a bad man. I know I can get over it. In truth he used to have drug addiction as well and he managed to stop consuming. That is why I know he is capable. He is surrounded by many people&amp;#39;s that are willing to help him through it. I just want to know what to do. We are going to leave the house at least for a few days because it is taking a big toll on the three of us. This is our last try. No matter how much we love him, we also have to lookout for own well-being and as long as he has this problems, we can&amp;#39;t live a calm life. My mother is such a loving person and she still has faith that he can change. She talks sweetly to him even when he is yelling at her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I just hope someone can give me advice on what to do. It&amp;#39;s horrible to feel so powerless as I watch him basically destroy his life. The shop he opened hasn&amp;#39;t had success because of his alcoholism. We have basically run out of money and he is making no effort. I understand it is a hard transition for him but it&amp;#39;s not really an excuse. The worst part is I am studying psychology and I should know what to do but I don&amp;#39;t. It makes me feel so useless. Please, any advice would be greatly appreciated. After we leave I hope it kind of motivates him but I want to know how to approach the situation. How do we manage to make him want to get help. I know we can&amp;#39;t force him into any therapy but what can we do so he will want it? After that, will he only require a personal psychologist or will he need to be hospitalized? I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way , this is my first time posting on any subreddit so I apologize if I did something wrong.

It came &amp;amp; went for a couple of days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, I went to a conference and drank. A lot. Probably more than a fifth a day for a couple of days. The itching was there, and in my feet. The third night of the conference my hands itched so bad I didn&amp;#39;t get much sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Early on, Google searches pointed to liver disease, specifically cirrhosis, as a cause of itching in the hands and feet. And despite knowing this, yes, I kept drinking. I was (am) hoping it is something else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand cirrhosis is terminal. I can&amp;#39;t get in to see my primary care doc for a couple of days, so it all caught up with me today and I am freaking the fuck out, as noted in the headline. As far I can tell, the itching is the only symptom; no loss of weight/appetite (I&amp;#39;m 5-8 and 245, and oh yeah, Type II diabetic), no jaundice of skin or eyes. As for fatigue, it&amp;#39;s hard to say, as I spend so many days in a hangover blur. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost all my closest friends are also family members, so I can&amp;#39;t unload to them. I haven&amp;#39;t told my wife yet, and won&amp;#39;t until some test says I actually do have it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone with experience in this: If I do have cirrhosis, and stop drinking, will I live longer than not? I know my quality of life will be better not drinking, whether I&amp;#39;m dying or not, but it certainly would be an incentive to quit if I&amp;#39;ll live a little longer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any thoughts on this. Just writing it out helps. I went to an Urgent Care clinic an hour ago, tried to explain what was going on, &amp;amp; ask for antabuse &amp;amp; something to calm me down.

Have crawled further into the bottle the last 10 years. \n\nTwo weeks ago, abruptly, my hands started itching terribly. I thought it was a reaction to something at work. It came &amp; went for a couple of days. \n\nA couple of days later, I went to a conference and drank. A lot. Probably more than a fifth a day for a couple of days. The itching was there, and in my feet. The third night of the conference my hands itched so bad I didn't get much sleep. \n\nEarly on, Google searches pointed to liver disease, specifically cirrhosis, as a cause of itching in the hands and feet. And despite knowing this, yes, I kept drinking. I was (am) hoping it is something else. \n\nI understand cirrhosis is terminal. I can't get in to see my primary care doc for a couple of days, so it all caught up with me today and I am freaking the fuck out, as noted in the headline. As far I can tell, the itching is the only symptom; no loss of weight/appetite (I'm 5-8 and 245, and oh yeah, Type II diabetic), no jaundice of skin or eyes. As for fatigue, it's hard to say, as I spend so many days in a hangover blur. \n\nAlmost all my closest friends are also family members, so I can't unload to them. I haven't told my wife yet, and won't until some test says I actually do have it. \n\nFor anyone with experience in this: If I do have cirrhosis, and stop drinking, will I live longer than not? I know my quality of life will be better not drinking, whether I'm dying or not, but it certainly would be an incentive to quit if I'll live a little longer. \n\nThanks for any thoughts on this. Just writing it out helps. I went to an Urgent Care clinic an hour ago, tried to explain what was going on, &amp; ask for antabuse &amp; something to calm me down. They denied the latter, and said they would write the former, but convinced me I need professional help to quit, not to try it again on my own. \n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6y4px3", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "48, alcoholic, and convinced I have Cirrhosis, freaking TF out", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 11, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6y4px3", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/6y4px3/48_alcoholic_and_convinced_i_have_cirrhosis/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1504603777.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/6y4px3/48_alcoholic_and_convinced_i_have_cirrhosis/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Crateredguy", "created_utc": 1504574977.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, I am not sure if this is the right place for my post, as it is not about myself.

I have a very good/high paying career, steady relationships, have recently lost 45 lbs from diet changes (a little more to go, this new potential change should help) among other things.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I drink every night and quite a lot, something like 8-12 shots worth of mixed drinks.  I know it falls under the &amp;quot;self-medication&amp;quot; category.  I use alcohol to &amp;quot;turn off my brain&amp;quot; after I finish with all my daily responsibilities.  I adhere to a basic rule of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t get drunk if there&amp;#39;s still shit you need to get done today.  I can have a beer during dinner, or a happy hour, baseball game or whatever and stop myself after.  But when I get home, I&amp;#39;ll drink until it&amp;#39;s bed time, that&amp;#39;s usually 3-4 hours a day.  I&amp;#39;ve been doing something like this for the better part of 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I drink to escape a particularly bad day, but lot of it is just anxiety from it is from thinking about day to day realities.  Like, I think about the physics of the big bang to the formation of the solar system and Earth, and knowing that life randomly spawned one day, and that&amp;#39;s my great ancestor.  And the fact that we&amp;#39;ve evolved brains so intricate and simultaneously idiotic that it can get itself addicted to something it knows could end up killing it.  And that, in agregate, those same kinds of brains are causing serious global damage and those same brains somehow got someone like Trump elected (don&amp;#39;t care if your Republican, Democrat it in between, Trump as POTUS is fucking weird).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a really hard time keeping from over analysing stuff like that, and a lot of it makes me depressed.  Drinking largely let&amp;#39;s me turn that part of my brain off and I can sit back and laugh my ass of to dinner stupid comedy for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, why am I posting today?  Well, I had a panic attack this week and it really messed with me.  See, I noticed one day that I was a little shaky and had some spasms one morning.  That&amp;#39;s not typical at all for me, and after thinking about it, a strange feedback loop happened.  I asked myself what was the cause, and my brain immediately went to worse case scenario of &amp;quot;oh shit, I have ALS&amp;quot;.  After several hours of my stupid brain convincing itself it has one of the most rare diseases, I was able to walk myself off that particular ledge.  I mean it was bad, to the point I was thinking of estate planning and thinking of how to tell people and praying my girlfriend would stick around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, I haven&amp;#39;t had many direct negative things come to light due to multiple drinking luckily.  I&amp;#39;ve had the occasional hangover if I stayed up late or something.  But I never had the shakes (nor did I know that was a thing), or drunken arguments (I&amp;#39;m a happy drunk), or anything really.

I have a very good/high paying career, steady relationships, have recently lost 45 lbs from diet changes (a little more to go, this new potential change should help) among other things.  \n\nHowever, I drink every night and quite a lot, something like 8-12 shots worth of mixed drinks.  I know it falls under the \"self-medication\" category.  I use alcohol to \"turn off my brain\" after I finish with all my daily responsibilities.  I adhere to a basic rule of \"don't get drunk if there's still shit you need to get done today.  I can have a beer during dinner, or a happy hour, baseball game or whatever and stop myself after.  But when I get home, I'll drink until it's bed time, that's usually 3-4 hours a day.  I've been doing something like this for the better part of 10 years.\n\nSometimes I drink to escape a particularly bad day, but lot of it is just anxiety from it is from thinking about day to day realities.  Like, I think about the physics of the big bang to the formation of the solar system and Earth, and knowing that life randomly spawned one day, and that's my great ancestor.  And the fact that we've evolved brains so intricate and simultaneously idiotic that it can get itself addicted to something it knows could end up killing it.  And that, in agregate, those same kinds of brains are causing serious global damage and those same brains somehow got someone like Trump elected (don't care if your Republican, Democrat it in between, Trump as POTUS is fucking weird).\n\nI have a really hard time keeping from over analysing stuff like that, and a lot of it makes me depressed.  Drinking largely let's me turn that part of my brain off and I can sit back and laugh my ass of to dinner stupid comedy for a while.\n\nSo, why am I posting today?  Well, I had a panic attack this week and it really messed with me.  See, I noticed one day that I was a little shaky and had some spasms one morning.  That's not typical at all for me, and after thinking about it, a strange feedback loop happened.  I asked myself what was the cause, and my brain immediately went to worse case scenario of \"oh shit, I have ALS\".  After several hours of my stupid brain convincing itself it has one of the most rare diseases, I was able to walk myself off that particular ledge.  I mean it was bad, to the point I was thinking of estate planning and thinking of how to tell people and praying my girlfriend would stick around.\n\nSee, I haven't had many direct negative things come to light due to multiple drinking luckily.  I've had the occasional hangover if I stayed up late or something.  But I never had the shakes (nor did I know that was a thing), or drunken arguments (I'm a happy drunk), or anything really.  Alcohol, to this point, has largely been, in my eyes, a benign source of pleasure, and my stupid brain has probably kept itself from looking into the negatives too much.\n\nAfter freaking the fuck out, I had to look up some info on ALS, and what I read conflicted with what I'm physically feeling.

According to my grandmother, she&amp;#39;s been to 20 or so programs throughout her life but nothing seems to have worked.

Eventually my grandmother and I were getting the &amp;quot;just one more&amp;quot; treatment, a request which would be asked a few times a day. When we began turning down her requests (due to her being drunk all the time) she started lying to us, asking if we could drive her to buy food, because she was &amp;quot;tired of driving&amp;quot; after driving up from the neighbor city. She was pretty committed too, actually buying food even if it only meant getting one beer, and she&amp;#39;d only drink at night when we were asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently she slipped up though and we figured out she was lying to us. We talked to her about it, and she agreed to drink in moderation and to be honest. That lasted about a week, and then she degenerated even further, outright telling us she was getting beer, and walking to do so if we refused to drive her. She started drinking from morning to night, and that brings us to now, where this recent behavior is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve offered her support throughout this whole ordeal, explaining that if she&amp;#39;s so stressed, she can lean on us rather than on alcohol, and we&amp;#39;ve tried our hardest to act on that promise. Usually she&amp;#39;ll apologize, tell us she loves us, and promises to stop, but then it continues the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re at our wits end here. My mother gets very aggressive when she drinks, and she gets aggressive when we try to keep her or stop her from drinking. Currently I&amp;#39;m living with my grandmother, but I mostly worry for her safety when I&amp;#39;m not there but my mom is. We live in NY, and from what I understand we can involuntarily commit her to a program, but to do so has some pretty strict requirements, all of which she hasn&amp;#39;t met yet. That said, she denies having a problem, and won&amp;#39;t commit herself to a program because she&amp;#39;s going back to school and has a job, and doesn&amp;#39;t want to dedicate the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any suggestions on how we can proceed, I&amp;#39;m all ears.

According to my grandmother, she's been to 20 or so programs throughout her life but nothing seems to have worked. She works a city away, and comes back up to stay with my grandmother when she's not working, but all she does is use us to drive her around so she can buy alcohol.\n\nShe was on probation recently and couldn't drink, and then when she was off probation she would have one here and there, nothing serious at first. Eventually my grandmother and I were getting the \"just one more\" treatment, a request which would be asked a few times a day. When we began turning down her requests (due to her being drunk all the time) she started lying to us, asking if we could drive her to buy food, because she was \"tired of driving\" after driving up from the neighbor city. She was pretty committed too, actually buying food even if it only meant getting one beer, and she'd only drink at night when we were asleep.\n\nRecently she slipped up though and we figured out she was lying to us. We talked to her about it, and she agreed to drink in moderation and to be honest. That lasted about a week, and then she degenerated even further, outright telling us she was getting beer, and walking to do so if we refused to drive her. She started drinking from morning to night, and that brings us to now, where this recent behavior is the norm.\n\nWe've offered her support throughout this whole ordeal, explaining that if she's so stressed, she can lean on us rather than on alcohol, and we've tried our hardest to act on that promise. Usually she'll apologize, tell us she loves us, and promises to stop, but then it continues the next day.\n\nWe're at our wits end here. My mother gets very aggressive when she drinks, and she gets aggressive when we try to keep her or stop her from drinking. Currently I'm living with my grandmother, but I mostly worry for her safety when I'm not there but my mom is. We live in NY, and from what I understand we can involuntarily commit her to a program, but to do so has some pretty strict requirements, all of which she hasn't met yet. That said, she denies having a problem, and won't commit herself to a program because she's going back to school and has a job, and doesn't want to dedicate the time.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on how we can proceed, I'm all ears.

I still wanted to maintain separation and it was clear that we were in a &amp;quot;trial separation&amp;quot; at this point so the therapist indicated that we consider a three month approach to see where we are both at and evaluate our decision on the relationship at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 19th, I hear her say in therapy that she has been mostly sober except for one Saturday where she experienced guilt due to a homeless man taking money from her till while she was paying attention to customers and she had a glass of wine that night.

She gave feedback on the SMART Recovery meetings, that she likes one day over the other, but that she thought the SMART Recovery meetings were depressing or not relatable because she listened to other people&amp;#39;s stories and couldn&amp;#39;t do anything to help them.  She said that she doesn&amp;#39;t see the point in going to those meetings if she already has tools at her disposal through &lt;a href=\"/r/stopdrinking\"&gt;/r/stopdrinking&lt;/a&gt; and can focus on those while managing her drinking.  The therapist shared how studies have shown trying to control the drinking by yourself can be self-defeating and that a support system is necessary, recommending to my loved one trying AA because of the 12 Step program.  My loved one says she has no problem cutting off her drinking if we were to return to a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spoke on August 23rd by phone.

If I am unable to succeed with this method, I will seek out medical help, but I feel like I can do this!\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6v5bbw", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Well, I did it.

For the past few years my father has had a growing problem with his alcohol consumption. He works a very stressful job as an engineering manager. I&amp;#39;m close to finishing univeristy, so I haven&amp;#39;t been home alot but my mother started noticing that my father began drinking more a few years ago. Its not a lot, maybe a large glass of wine per day, so shes been telling him not to as she also does with sweets/unhealthy food when he knows he shouldn&amp;#39;t be having that late night snack etc...     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two years ago my mother discovered that he&amp;#39;s been hiding his alcohol consumption by buying small bottles and hiding them in his car/ drinking them at some point between work and coming home. He works long days, usually 6am - 6pm so he has time to stop by LCBO and grab stuff. My mom had suspected he had been drinking in secret and this had really been taking an emotional toll on her (she started doubting herself). After she found the bottle and showed me, my mother and I presented the bottle to him and talked to him about the drinking and that it was becoming an issue. It seemed to help because I think he stopped for a bit, I don&amp;#39;t know when he started up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few months ago he lost his job (although I suspect he started or continued to drink leading up to the firing). He had a pretty bad boss that yelled alot and was out to get him, so I highly doubt the alcohol contributed to his job loss. Luckily he found a job relatively quickly, but it took a mental toll on him during this summer. A few months ago my mom found two small-medium sized bottles of alcohol in the recycling. Unfortunately she didn&amp;#39;t hold onto them but only had the picture. When we showed him the picture, he said he found them in the backyard (somehow?) and that he threw them out. I didn&amp;#39;t want to press him since he had recently lost his job and had enough to worry about. He eventually found a new job after two months as a manager again of a similar salary but this summer took a really hard mental toll.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today he came home later than usual from work, around 8pm. (his commute is only a half hour so 8pm is unusual). While he was in the bathroom, my mom went outside to check the recyling and she found one 375ml bottle of 40% irish wisky, medium-small sized. We are trying to figure out when to talk to him about this and what our next steps should be. Tomorrow (saturday) we&amp;#39;re busy the whole day since my parents are helping me move into another university apartment (but I&amp;#39;m still going to be home for the rest of the summer).

I figured the earlier the better since the next two weekends we are litterally completely booked, and he&amp;#39;s exhausted during the week when he comes home at 6:30pm (and might drink).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was going to mention that we love him and use non-accusatory language to address the situation. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve noticed that you&amp;#39;ve been drinking a lot and we are worried about your mental and physical health&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since he&amp;#39;s already used the excuse two months ago about &amp;quot;finding the bottles&amp;quot; (and we didn&amp;#39;t present them DIRECLTY to him, it will be harder for him to deny this). Also since we&amp;#39;ve had this conversation two years ago and the problem came back/continued I was thinking that I should get him maybe to a psychologist?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is it might be hard to convince him to see a psychologist, I don&amp;#39;t know how to find one, and he litterally works 12 hrs per day to support the family at a stressful job, so going during the week is not feasible.

We have been together for 2.5 years, and I&amp;#39;ve never been happier. We never argue or fight, we both have the same hobbies and do everything together. We are each others best friends. At the same time, we are comfortable enough to be alone and enjoy our own time, or be with our friends without eachother. I can not stress how amazing my partner is. The problem is, I&amp;#39;m scared my SO is abusing alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little more than a year ago my SO might have had a drink every other day. Bourbon is the go to. I don&amp;#39;t drink much either, so this was perfect. Things started going downhill when one of my SO&amp;#39;s oldest friends passed away. It was heartbreaking and unexpected, and it really hit my SO hard. For the next few months the drinking escalated...two a night, three a night, sometimes even four of five.  As we stand currently, my SO will finish a 1.75 L bottle of bourbon in 5-6 days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m terrified, but I also feel guilty. The loss of such a close friend added to an extremely stressful job would be more than enough to make me hit the bottle.

I love my SO with all my heart, and I will do anything to keep him/her safe. I&amp;#39;m scared of bringing it up too often, because he/she displays no outward sign of alcoholism.

We have been together for 2.5 years, and I've never been happier. We never argue or fight, we both have the same hobbies and do everything together. We are each others best friends. At the same time, we are comfortable enough to be alone and enjoy our own time, or be with our friends without eachother. I can not stress how amazing my partner is. The problem is, I'm scared my SO is abusing alcohol. \n\nA little more than a year ago my SO might have had a drink every other day. Bourbon is the go to. I don't drink much either, so this was perfect. Things started going downhill when one of my SO's oldest friends passed away. It was heartbreaking and unexpected, and it really hit my SO hard. For the next few months the drinking escalated...two a night, three a night, sometimes even four of five.  As we stand currently, my SO will finish a 1.75 L bottle of bourbon in 5-6 days. \n\nI'm terrified, but I also feel guilty.

I&amp;#39;ve been to inpatient treatment twice over the course of my life, once when I was 19 and most recently in December 2016 (31 at the time). Both times I went were due to the adamant insistence of my Father. He essentially told me I was dead to him if I didn&amp;#39;t go to treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both times in treatment, I was kept out of the &amp;quot;detox&amp;quot; protocol, as I had no symptoms of detox or withdrawal. While I could identify with certain aspects of other&amp;#39;s stories, I found myself magnifying and over-dramatizing my own experiences with alcohol and drugs to appear to relate better. Principally, I could not relate at all to the &amp;quot;lack of control&amp;quot; people spoke of. I have never experienced an instance where I told myself &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll have a beer or two with dinner&amp;quot; an ended up drunk a few hours later. Never. I certainly have experienced being excessively drunk, drinking many days in a row, drinking for effect, drinking alone, etc. and I understand all of that is risky and unhealthy. I&amp;#39;ve never been unable to stop when I wanted to. I&amp;#39;ve never had withdrawals. I&amp;#39;ve been going to AA since I got sober in December but I&amp;#39;m starting to question whether I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic or have alcoholic tendencies. I&amp;#39;m really confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like going to AA. I feel like a phony. I&amp;#39;m happier, more content, and honestly think about drinking a lot less when I don&amp;#39;t go. Sobriety honestly hasn&amp;#39;t been very difficult for me. The recent push for me to go to treatment had been due to a &amp;quot;low point&amp;quot; in life last Summer. I was depressed (my dog had just died and broke up with my girlfriend a few months before that), stressed and unhappy at my job, wanted to relocate but kind of locked-in due to my mortgage; was just generally miserable. I admitted I was drinking more than usual and drinking alone, and the assessment from my Father and Stepmom was that I&amp;#39;m an alcoholic and my only hope was quitting drinking. I did that, and though I didn&amp;#39;t expect a &amp;quot;magic bullet&amp;quot; or a fix for all my problems, I still feel the same as I did last year, worse even. I&amp;#39;m not interested in resuming drinking right now because, alcoholic or not, that&amp;#39;s no way to deal with your problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as the ACOA question, it again has to do with my Father. There is no doubt that he was a heavy drinker my entire life. As I got older, I realized the ever-present red solo cup of vodka was not &amp;quot;what every parent did&amp;quot;, nor was the passing out drunk on the couch every single night. In recent years, I live on my own, my Father is semi-retired, and he lives near my work. I&amp;#39;d occasionally stop by to see him/go to lunch with him/etc. There have been dozens of instances where I have found him blackout drunk by noon, slurring his words, barely able to stand/walk functionally; I&amp;#39;ve never found myself in a situation close to that. When I first went to treatment and got sober when I was young, I mentioned how his drinking concerned me, in as non-confrontational and non-judgmental a way I could imagine. He accused me of &amp;quot;blaming him&amp;quot; for my problems, which I repeatedly stated I was not doing, and honestly did not feel that way. He then proceeded to unequivocally state that he did not start drinking until &amp;quot;my problems&amp;quot; started. &amp;quot;My problems&amp;quot; referred to him catching me smoking weed in high school. As would be the case later in my life, this was deemed &amp;quot;drug addiction&amp;quot; and was cited as the factor in my &amp;quot;academic problems&amp;quot; - problems that included dropping from high honor roll to B+/A- GPA; from taking &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; 4th year classes as a third year student, instead of Advanced Placement. And I know for a fact he had drinking issues dating back to before I ever touched alcohol or drugs. After my Mother died when I was 14, my brother and I went to counseling/therapy, as her death was unexpected and traumatic (suicide). My Father was called out by my therapist for regularly dropping us off and picking us up drunk, slurring, and smelling of booze. He has been in at least two car accidents following drinking, once with my brother and I in the car. Numerous friends and family members of his generation, when pressed by me, have admitted to him having drinking problems. My therapist, breaking professional ethics in what she believed was my in best interest, informed me that his drinking issues predated my birth, and were a major issue in the dissolution of my parent&amp;#39;s marriage. My Mother, before her death but after my parent&amp;#39;s divorce, frequently warned me to &amp;quot;not get into the car if your Father has been drinking&amp;quot;, and inquiring as to whether he had hit me when we would be in his care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know; I&amp;#39;m just really confused. Looking back, I kind of feel like a constant scapegoat for my family&amp;#39;s issues. I feel like I&amp;#39;m holding the water for someone else&amp;#39;s problems. And that&amp;#39;s the quandary I find myself in now. Should I dare ever want to talk with my Father about his drinking and the effect it had on our family, my mother, their divorce, my brother, etc. I&amp;#39;ll be seen as &amp;quot;blaming&amp;quot; him. And I really don&amp;#39;t give a shit about blame. The only real feelings of resentment I currently have towards him are the effect he had on my little brother, who was only 10 years old, and had a dead Mother and a drunk, unavailable Father. I understand addiction/alcoholism and how difficult it can be to overcome. But I feel that when you have children, there is a much greater need to address your own problems so you can be a sufficient caretaker and guardian for someone who depends on you. I was older and stronger than my brother, I am responsible for everything I do, and I&amp;#39;ve long since let go of many of my personal resentments towards my Father. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, I feel I&amp;#39;ve really &amp;quot;boxed myself in&amp;quot; by agreeing to treatment and identifying as an alcoholic. I worry that if I &amp;quot;relapse&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;ll be seen as a &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;, and my friends and family will believe that things will inevitably spiral out of control (as is the general understanding of addiction/alcoholism/substance abuse and relapse). I don&amp;#39;t have any desire to drink right now, but I do miss my social life, which frequently did involve the presence of alcohol. I do miss hanging out with friends and having a few beers, having a glass of wine or two with dinner, meeting a date for drinks. 99% of the times I&amp;#39;ve ever drank were completely &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;, without negative consequences or excessive intoxication, etc. I see my family (including close cousins) 9-10 times a year, and every single one confirmed they had only seen me intoxicated once, at a Christmas party several years ago. Even in that instance, I wasn&amp;#39;t slurring, stumbling, or being rude, loud or mean, but I was obviously intoxicated. I dunno; it happens sometimes, doesn&amp;#39;t it? Does anyone who has ever had a negative experience with alcohol automatically have a &amp;quot;drinking problem&amp;quot;? Can anyone experience a period of using alcohol as an unhealthy coping mechanism, and not be an alcoholic? I used to smoke a lot of weed when I was younger, but I quit in my mid-20&amp;#39;s. I have smoked a handful of times since then and never felt a pull to return to regular use. I went through a couple month period in college where I did a lot of cocaine. Same thing; over the last ten years, I&amp;#39;ve done a line of blow 3 or 4 times and never felt any kind of overwhelming urge to do it again or return to using it. Many people go through points in college where they drink excessively, use drugs, etc. and reign it in as they get older. That is my general experience: I partied a lot in college, then quit all drugs except for weed and alcohol after treatment. Ten years went by where everything was fine as far as I and anyone else was concerned. I quit weed on my own because it didn&amp;#39;t really fit who I was anymore, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk getting arrested or anything (I have a good job and professional license). I liked to drink and have a good time, and occasionally I over-imbibed to the point where I was drunk. And by that I don&amp;#39;t mean blackout, getting sick, stumbling/slurring etc. I mean I shouldn&amp;#39;t be operating a motor vehicle in my current state, and I should stop or cut back my rate of drinking to sober up. I hadn&amp;#39;t been sick from drinking since college; probably nearly ten years. I was almost never hungover. People in AA reasoned that this was because I had a high tolerance from my alcoholism, or I was drunk all the time so it never hit me, but these are just objectively untrue statements. That has been the most frustrating thing; people in AA have a response to everything. Examining if I&amp;#39;m truly an addict is &amp;quot;rationalizing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;giving myself a reason to keep using&amp;quot;. Going to less meetings because I don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable or that they are helpful to me is &amp;quot;being one step closer to a drink&amp;quot;. Advising someone who is thinking about possibly returning to drinking/attempting moderation that the only possible outcome is their life will be a living hell, everyone they love will despise them, and they&amp;#39;ll eventually die - isn&amp;#39;t that psychotic? Can that possibly be the case for EVERYONE who has once been in, and then left AA? I&amp;#39;m really unhappy with this becoming the defining aspect of my life, for good or for bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ugh. I&amp;#39;m sorry for the wall of text. I should just save this and use it as a cathartic exercise, but I&amp;#39;ll throw it out there because I&amp;#39;m kind of at my wits end. I&amp;#39;m hoping someone can identify with any of this and offer any guidance or advice. Because I am fucking lost, and am more confused and unhappy than when I was drinking excessively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Anyone have any experience with this group, the writings, or really anything associated with the concept?

My Mother, before her death but after my parent's divorce, frequently warned me to \"not get into the car if your Father has been drinking\", and inquiring as to whether he had hit me when we would be in his care.\n\nI don't know; I'm just really confused. Looking back, I kind of feel like a constant scapegoat for my family's issues. I feel like I'm holding the water for someone else's problems. And that's the quandary I find myself in now. Should I dare ever want to talk with my Father about his drinking and the effect it had on our family, my mother, their divorce, my brother, etc. I'll be seen as \"blaming\" him. And I really don't give a shit about blame. The only real feelings of resentment I currently have towards him are the effect he had on my little brother, who was only 10 years old, and had a dead Mother and a drunk, unavailable Father. I understand addiction/alcoholism and how difficult it can be to overcome. But I feel that when you have children, there is a much greater need to address your own problems so you can be a sufficient caretaker and guardian for someone who depends on you. I was older and stronger than my brother, I am responsible for everything I do, and I've long since let go of many of my personal resentments towards my Father. \n\nAdding to this, I feel I've really \"boxed myself in\" by agreeing to treatment and identifying as an alcoholic. I worry that if I \"relapse\", it'll be seen as a \"failure\", and my friends and family will believe that things will inevitably spiral out of control (as is the general understanding of addiction/alcoholism/substance abuse and relapse). I don't have any desire to drink right now, but I do miss my social life, which frequently did involve the presence of alcohol. I do miss hanging out with friends and having a few beers, having a glass of wine or two with dinner, meeting a date for drinks. 99% of the times I've ever drank were completely \"normal\", without negative consequences or excessive intoxication, etc. I see my family (including close cousins) 9-10 times a year, and every single one confirmed they had only seen me intoxicated once, at a Christmas party several years ago. Even in that instance, I wasn't slurring, stumbling, or being rude, loud or mean, but I was obviously intoxicated. I dunno; it happens sometimes, doesn't it? Does anyone who has ever had a negative experience with alcohol automatically have a \"drinking problem\"? Can anyone experience a period of using alcohol as an unhealthy coping mechanism, and not be an alcoholic? I used to smoke a lot of weed when I was younger, but I quit in my mid-20's. I have smoked a handful of times since then and never felt a pull to return to regular use. I went through a couple month period in college where I did a lot of cocaine. Same thing; over the last ten years, I've done a line of blow 3 or 4 times and never felt any kind of overwhelming urge to do it again or return to using it. Many people go through points in college where they drink excessively, use drugs, etc. and reign it in as they get older. That is my general experience: I partied a lot in college, then quit all drugs except for weed and alcohol after treatment. Ten years went by where everything was fine as far as I and anyone else was concerned. I quit weed on my own because it didn't really fit who I was anymore, and I didn't want to risk getting arrested or anything (I have a good job and professional license). I liked to drink and have a good time, and occasionally I over-imbibed to the point where I was drunk. And by that I don't mean blackout, getting sick, stumbling/slurring etc. I mean I shouldn't be operating a motor vehicle in my current state, and I should stop or cut back my rate of drinking to sober up. I hadn't been sick from drinking since college; probably nearly ten years. I was almost never hungover. People in AA reasoned that this was because I had a high tolerance from my alcoholism, or I was drunk all the time so it never hit me, but these are just objectively untrue statements. That has been the most frustrating thing; people in AA have a response to everything. Examining if I'm truly an addict is \"rationalizing\" and \"giving myself a reason to keep using\". Going to less meetings because I don't feel comfortable or that they are helpful to me is \"being one step closer to a drink\". Advising someone who is thinking about possibly returning to drinking/attempting moderation that the only possible outcome is their life will be a living hell, everyone they love will despise them, and they'll eventually die - isn't that psychotic? Can that possibly be the case for EVERYONE who has once been in, and then left AA? I'm really unhappy with this becoming the defining aspect of my life, for good or for bad.\n\nUgh. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I should just save this and use it as a cathartic exercise, but I'll throw it out there because I'm kind of at my wits end. I'm hoping someone can identify with any of this and offer any guidance or advice.

My dad is a contractor/flooring installer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom&amp;#39;s job turned her into an alcoholic.  My dad has always drank beer but is definitely functioning.  We didn&amp;#39;t know my mom had a problem for the first few years she had (probably) started drinking.  Then she got in trouble at work for drinking.  We made the connections from there.  It has only gotten worse.  She ended up being terminated after 1 DUI and she has gotten a 2nd DUI since.  She has crashed one of our cars and totaled another, which is when she almost hit someone head on.  Fast forward to today and she is actually set to go to jail later this year for 75-150 days due to her 2nd DUI. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of times she has been to the hospital for blacking out and basically being unconscious, and for withdrawing\u2014I could not count.  I don&amp;#39;t know how her vitals come back okay every time at the time she is released.  She always goes in with a high blood alcohol level, at her worst it has been as high as 3 point something (the doctor wonders how she can be even slightly coherent at that stage but that goes to show you how much of a tolerance she has). I worry that she will experience liver failure and/or will die one day whether it be from her organ health to drunk driving.  She is in denial or she does not care about her health...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom cashed out her retirement to help us remain financially stable.  My parents refinanced earlier this year as well. We are making things work for now, but she has been without a job for 2 years now because of her drinking and the excuses that come with it.  She did go to rehab for 30 days the year she lost her job because she could not stop drinking.  She was sober for about 2-3 months afterwards but soon started drinking again.  The AA meetings are not her thing, she says there are lots of strange people and it doesn&amp;#39;t make her heal or feel comfortable regardless of those people.  I don&amp;#39;t blame her, I don&amp;#39;t think I would enjoy it either but whatever works for you, you know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has bad anxiety and in turn, bouts of depression.  She is on and off the wagon quite often depending on what happens to trigger her (which can be a lot of things).  She is easily stressed.  Her self esteem is very low which has been caused by and also causes tension in my parents&amp;#39; relationship even though for the most part everything is fine between them.  She has tried going on medication to help her anxiety, but she will lie to us and say she is taking the meds but she isn&amp;#39;t.  Basically she doesn&amp;#39;t even know if it will end up helping because she doesn&amp;#39;t take anything religiously.  I would like her to try smoking cannabis or using CBD oils, or different medication, but &amp;quot;that stuff all makes me feel weird&amp;quot;.  She is basically happy drinking her problems away even though that&amp;#39;s the opposite of what happens. It creates more anxiety/depression and more problems.  Every time we confront her, she says things like &amp;quot;you know me&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;yep I&amp;#39;m a drunk&amp;quot;.  I know she wants to stop, but addiction is a crazy thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my dad, my brother and I have been emotionally supporting her for all of these years. It&amp;#39;s very draining as nothing we do has worked for more than a month or 2.  She lost her license so she would buy vodka every time she went out shopping with my grandparents.  Possibly buying multiple bottles to stash somewhere.  We used to find empty bottles under the mattress and in random purses she kept.  We have made my grandparents aware so they are present when she checks out in the store and everything.  I had to change my doorknob to my room so I could lock it from the inside and also with a key on the outside when I leave for work.  She has invaded my privacy multiple times looking for alcohol, searching through my personal belongings in my closet and under my bed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We doubt she has anything left so she has been sober for a few weeks now.  She feels like my mom when she&amp;#39;s sober, but when she goes on a drinking binge, it&amp;#39;s very mentally stressful for the rest of us.  I&amp;#39;m sure for her as well.  My dad is holding on as long as he can.  I can tell he is hopeful somewhere deep inside.  Although he told my brother and I, he is reevaluating what he needs to do to be happy (aka leave). He says, &amp;quot;Will she ever be the person I fell in love with?&amp;quot; :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for them both.  I wish them both the best, but my dad doesn&amp;#39;t deserve to live a life he will end up resenting.  He is a strong person, but this type of thing wears on you.  My brother and I have a life ahead of us, but my mom is my dad&amp;#39;s significant other so there&amp;#39;s only so much he can currently do without doing what is right for him and his mental well-being...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother and I will probably move out on our own next year and I feel guilty for leaving my dad with this situation even though I would visit all the time.  I know I have to do things for myself and I am starting to focus on that because my emotional distress due to this situation has robbed me of many years of happiness and therefore success in my own life.  I do not currently have health insurance and can&amp;#39;t just drop a few hundred on one session with a therapist, so I&amp;#39;m trying to reach out to someone until I can go to therapy.  I&amp;#39;m not sure how to handle this situation anymore.  I don&amp;#39;t think any of us do, but I want to see my mom get better.  She hasn&amp;#39;t done intentionally done anything to us, she just hurts us when she hurts herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid that when I&amp;#39;m on my own, something bad will happen.  I know I can&amp;#39;t fix things, people have to be willing to fix themselves, but I want to do as much as I can without causing anymore mental harm for myself while I&amp;#39;m trying to get my life together.  I have anxiety as well though it&amp;#39;s not as severe as hers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any kind words or advice or suggestions would be very greatly appreciated.

My brother and I have a life ahead of us, but my mom is my dad's significant other so there's only so much he can currently do without doing what is right for him and his mental well-being...\n\nMy brother and I will probably move out on our own next year and I feel guilty for leaving my dad with this situation even though I would visit all the time.  I know I have to do things for myself and I am starting to focus on that because my emotional distress due to this situation has robbed me of many years of happiness and therefore success in my own life.  I do not currently have health insurance and can't just drop a few hundred on one session with a therapist, so I'm trying to reach out to someone until I can go to therapy.  I'm not sure how to handle this situation anymore.  I don't think any of us do, but I want to see my mom get better.  She hasn't done intentionally done anything to us, she just hurts us when she hurts herself.\n\nI'm afraid that when I'm on my own, something bad will happen.  I know I can't fix things, people have to be willing to fix themselves, but I want to do as much as I can without causing anymore mental harm for myself while I'm trying to get my life together.  I have anxiety as well though it's not as severe as hers.  \n\nAny kind words or advice or suggestions would be very greatly appreciated.

PLEASE do not read if you feel that it will harm your recovery at all.&lt;br/&gt;\nI am 25 years old, of healthy weight, and few previous physical health problems. I had about five drinks approximately three times a week since I was about 20, and it never affected me too negatively, aside from the occasional hangover. However, after a trauma, I have been drinking heavily each day for about eight months, and over the past few months, I have gone on some benders where I just drink for days straight to avoid the symptoms, which go away after approximately 3 drinks. After about five drinks, I feel normal and completely sober. The heavier I drink the night before, the worse the symptoms are. I previously used cocaine when I drank, but that has stopped. I had three drinks last night, and I feel okay and fairly normal today. I have not drank yet today (it is 11:30pm), but I will have a few drinks after this to keep myself physically safe.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe symptoms I\u2019m experiencing are terrifying, and they are extremely hard to describe, but I&amp;#39;ll try my best. It feels unlike anything I&amp;#39;ve ever felt before. Almost like straight up delirium. They occur approximately 8-12 hours after my last drink- I usually wake up feeling okay, but after an hour or two, I&amp;#39;m experiencing the symptoms. They do not seem to resolve with eating or drinking water, but I think if I drink more water the night before, they\u2019re a little less severe. I feel a tightness in my chest after walking. I experience severe psychomotor agitation- I twitch, and if I\u2019m sitting still, I\u2019m almost constantly fidgeting. I have to constantly be moving my eyes around, because when I focus on one thing for too long, I get dizzy, and then I jolt. It\u2019s like my body is full of electricity. It feels similar to being extremely tired and trying not to fall asleep, and I feel almost narcoleptic, but it\u2019s not that, because if I lay down and close my eyes when I\u2019m like this, I don\u2019t fall asleep. I experience what feels like sleep starts (hypnic jerk), even though I\u2019m awake, at times up to once every ten seconds. It\u2019s like I have to focus on trying to quell these starts by moving around. It terrifies me to drive when I\u2019m like this. I\u2019ll have twitches along with the starts, like for example, when my hand is on the steering wheel and I feel one of these starts, my arm might suddenly flex. It feels just like I\u2019m having mini seizures, and I don\u2019t know how to describe how I feel this way, but sometimes I feel like I am going to go into a full motor seizure (I\u2019ve never actually had a seizure before, so I can\u2019t tell you why I think this). Sometimes I feel so bad and out of control of my body that I feel like I might drop dead then and there. I almost feel that I am going to faint all the time, and when I\u2019m standing, I feel like I might faint. My words get jumbled, and I may not be able to form a sentence the way I want to over text message, and it\u2019s frustrating. My short term memory is nonexistent- I can go to do something (i.e. send a text message) and then promptly forget about it. I forget things- like when I\u2019m getting out of my car, it takes me much longer than usual to gather the things I need together, and then I\u2019ll realize I left something important (like a wallet) sitting in the seat beside me. I don&amp;#39;t experience mental anxiety, and I&amp;#39;ve never been prone to anxiety. However, I do feel like my body is on edge and it calms down after a few drinks. I feel self-conscious about the way I act and speak when I&amp;#39;m like this- sometimes I act &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; or my words just don&amp;#39;t come out right. The physical symptoms improve a lot when I\u2019m walking around and not sitting still, but I am in class for periods of time, and that\u2019s when I notice it the most.&lt;br/&gt;\nMy cognition is noticeably impaired, all the physical effects are completely unbearable and I\u2019m not functional. I am not looking for advice or judgment. I FULLY know that I need serious help, and I am getting it, and I am going into medical detox next week. I know that treatment is imperative. But I want to know if anyone has had the same or similar symptoms. It just doesn\u2019t sound like everyone else\u2019s experience of alcohol withdrawal to me, and I was curious as to others\u2019 experiences. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something else going on with me neurologically other than withdrawal, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll be talking to my doctor about. I know reddit cannot diagnose me and I&amp;#39;m certainly not relying on that, but I just wanted to get any type of insight at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "First of all, this is not a happy post- I am still sick, and I am discussing it here, although I am on my way to mentally getting better as soon as I can physically recover.

I have not drank yet today (it is 11:30pm), but I will have a few drinks after this to keep myself physically safe.  \nThe symptoms I\u2019m experiencing are terrifying, and they are extremely hard to describe, but I'll try my best. It feels unlike anything I've ever felt before. Almost like straight up delirium. They occur approximately 8-12 hours after my last drink- I usually wake up feeling okay, but after an hour or two, I'm experiencing the symptoms. They do not seem to resolve with eating or drinking water, but I think if I drink more water the night before, they\u2019re a little less severe. I feel a tightness in my chest after walking. I experience severe psychomotor agitation- I twitch, and if I\u2019m sitting still, I\u2019m almost constantly fidgeting. I have to constantly be moving my eyes around, because when I focus on one thing for too long, I get dizzy, and then I jolt. It\u2019s like my body is full of electricity. It feels similar to being extremely tired and trying not to fall asleep, and I feel almost narcoleptic, but it\u2019s not that, because if I lay down and close my eyes when I\u2019m like this, I don\u2019t fall asleep. I experience what feels like sleep starts (hypnic jerk), even though I\u2019m awake, at times up to once every ten seconds. It\u2019s like I have to focus on trying to quell these starts by moving around. It terrifies me to drive when I\u2019m like this. I\u2019ll have twitches along with the starts, like for example, when my hand is on the steering wheel and I feel one of these starts, my arm might suddenly flex. It feels just like I\u2019m having mini seizures, and I don\u2019t know how to describe how I feel this way, but sometimes I feel like I am going to go into a full motor seizure (I\u2019ve never actually had a seizure before, so I can\u2019t tell you why I think this). Sometimes I feel so bad and out of control of my body that I feel like I might drop dead then and there. I almost feel that I am going to faint all the time, and when I\u2019m standing, I feel like I might faint. My words get jumbled, and I may not be able to form a sentence the way I want to over text message, and it\u2019s frustrating. My short term memory is nonexistent- I can go to do something (i.e. send a text message) and then promptly forget about it. I forget things- like when I\u2019m getting out of my car, it takes me much longer than usual to gather the things I need together, and then I\u2019ll realize I left something important (like a wallet) sitting in the seat beside me. I don't experience mental anxiety, and I've never been prone to anxiety. However, I do feel like my body is on edge and it calms down after a few drinks. I feel self-conscious about the way I act and speak when I'm like this- sometimes I act \"weird\" or my words just don't come out right. The physical symptoms improve a lot when I\u2019m walking around and not sitting still, but I am in class for periods of time, and that\u2019s when I notice it the most.   \nMy cognition is noticeably impaired, all the physical effects are completely unbearable and I\u2019m not functional. I am not looking for advice or judgment. I FULLY know that I need serious help, and I am getting it, and I am going into medical detox next week. I know that treatment is imperative. But I want to know if anyone has had the same or similar symptoms. It just doesn\u2019t sound like everyone else\u2019s experience of alcohol withdrawal to me, and I was curious as to others\u2019 experiences. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something else going on with me neurologically other than withdrawal, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll be talking to my doctor about. I know reddit cannot diagnose me and I'm certainly not relying on that, but I just wanted to get any type of insight at all.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6p5w37", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Does this sound like normal physical withdrawal symptoms?

From what I have heard from friends and family, it started around the early 80&amp;#39;s, when my father was in high school. So instead, I&amp;#39;ll reflect on my life as an alcoholic&amp;#39;s daughter, in hopes that someone here can relate to me and help me through all of my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll start with my earliest memory. I am four or five years old, over at my aunt&amp;#39;s house. My parents were divorced, and I saw my dad on the weekends. When he was drunk, I would go to my aunt&amp;#39;s and play with my cousins. I never realized that my family was different than other families (outside of divorce) until this point. I am hiding behind an above-ground pool, my aunt and older cousin hiding with me, crouched over me and whispering in my ear, telling me to stay quiet. I hear my dad and my uncle shouting inside the house. I hear the metal of the screen door bang on the brick house. &amp;quot;WHERE IS MY FUCKING DAUGHTER!&amp;quot; I hear my father scream. &amp;quot;You know you can&amp;#39;t take her, Jeff&amp;quot; I hear my uncle say, as calm as possible though I know he is flustered. &amp;quot;SHE IS MY DAUGHTER, I CAN TAKE HER WHEREVER THE FUCK I WANT!&amp;quot; I hear my dad yell in return. He&amp;#39;s out on the patio, looking for me. There&amp;#39;s a loud noise, he has tripped over something and fallen on the cement patio. He yells in frustration, then screams &amp;quot;DON&amp;#39;T FUCKING TOUCH ME&amp;quot; when my uncle attempts to help him to his feet. He gets up and stumbles into the house. About 20 minutes later, my uncle comes outside to where we are still hiding and tells us that it&amp;#39;s okay to come inside. I walk into the house and find my father passed out while sitting up, his head leaned back, mouth wide open, snoring loudly. His pants are wet, and I feel embarrassed. My aunt tells me it&amp;#39;s okay if I want to say hi to him. I walk over and grab his hand, squeeze it and he lifts his head. &amp;quot;Hi, baby girl&amp;quot; he slurs before passing out again, in the same position as before I woke him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is how most people know my dad. But me, I know there&amp;#39;s so much more to him than his addiction. He was a good dad. He cuddled with me and watched Saturday morning cartoons. He played tea parties with me and let me put my Spice Girl hair extensions in his hair. He played guitar for me, and taught me to play myself when I was 14. Although he could barely stand up straight, he&amp;#39;s been to every major event in my life, from father/daughter school dances to the bigger ones like homecoming and prom, from cheerleading competitions to scholarship award ceremonies and graduations. He&amp;#39;s a caring, compassionate person on the inside. He&amp;#39;d give you the shirt off his back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad has been through so much in his life, and I wish others could understand this disease before passing judgement. My dad has always had severe anxiety, and he really struggles to control this. He&amp;#39;s been on Xanax (or something similar) since he was probably a teen. My grandma was the same way. My dad wanted to go to college at Miami University to study biomedical engineering, but his family couldn&amp;#39;t afford it. Somehow, he stumbled upon finance and became a mortgage broker. He opened his own company in the early 90&amp;#39;s and my entire family joined suit. He was pretty high-functioning in those days, and the business lasted for nearly 20 years. In 2002, my dad remarried. Around this time, his wife and he decided to get sober. Around this time include some of the best memories I have with my dad. As my mom got sicker and sicker with bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia, my dad fought for custody of me and won. In 2004, shortly after the custody battle was finalized, my mom committed suicide. About a week after this, my father disappeared for a week. Nobody heard from him or saw him. He was found outside a bar, with his face almost unrecognizable. Someone had beat him, and left him there. His nose was broken, his eyes were swollen shut. It was a horrific sight. His wife divorced him, and took him for everything he was worth, including the business he had worked so hard for and the house we lived in. We moved in with my grandparents until my dad could get back on his feet. Then, 2008 happened. A horrible time for the housing market. My dad had been working for Fannie Mae and lost his job. That&amp;#39;s when the depression really kicked in. He&amp;#39;s remained without a steady job since then, really. He&amp;#39;s worked odd jobs here and there, but that&amp;#39;s about it. Last year, he made a whopping total of $7k working on commission with a company who sells credit card machines and POS machines to merchants like gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t have many friends, and the friends he does have are equally as bad off as he is. My dad&amp;#39;s a killer guitar player, and sometimes he plays in bars with a few of his buddies. That&amp;#39;s about the only social interaction he has. For about four or five years now, he sleeps 12-15 hours a day and only comes out of the basement to use the restroom or eat every few days. When he&amp;#39;s not sleeping or eating, he&amp;#39;s drinking. He&amp;#39;s graduated from 24 packs of Bud-Light to 2-4 Four Lokos a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In May, a month before his 50th birthday, he made a scene in a local brewery and his girlfriend (of 4 years) brought him home, watched him fall off the front porch (cracking a few ribs), helped him to stumble down the steps to his room and climb in his bed in the basement of my grandfather&amp;#39;s house and left him. She texted him to say he has a real problem, he needs help and she&amp;#39;s changing the locks to her house. Two days later, my grandfather and his 3 siblings sat him down and told him he needs to get sober. They basically bullied him into it. After about 9 hours of intense conversation, he agreed. He went to the emergency room, where his BAC was almost .4 and he detoxed. It was the hardest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever had to watch. He vomited, he tremoured uncontrollably, he couldn&amp;#39;t walk or talk without extreme difficulty. He was sweating profusely and crying. &amp;quot;This is why I didn&amp;#39;t want to do this&amp;quot; he told me.&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;m going to die&amp;quot;. After his BAC came down, the ER shrugged their shoulders, gave him the boot and told me &amp;quot;come back when he starts to seize.&amp;quot; They poked fun at his Hep C, saying things like &amp;quot;you have Hep C? Oh, what a surprise&amp;quot;. They treated him like they were disgusted by his existence, like he was no more to them than the gum on the bottom of their shoes. He stayed sober for 10 days before relapsing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I got the call I&amp;#39;ve waited nearly 23 years for. My aunt called me to tell me that 2 days ago, my father called her and asked her to come over. He was drunk, and very upset. She immediately went to his house where he told her that he&amp;#39;s tired, that he can&amp;#39;t live like this anymore, that he wants to be sober again and enjoy his life. She drove him around all day to different treatment centers to see if any would take him, but they all said they didn&amp;#39;t have room or wouldn&amp;#39;t accept his state insurance. Finally, at her wits end, she turned to a different hospital than 2 months ago. We had some struggles with a few of the ER staff and their preconceived notions, but he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get admitted and now he&amp;#39;s sleeping, waiting on his BAC to come down and go through withdrawal all over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have so many mixed emotions. I hate to see him go through this. It kills me inside. Physically, I know he&amp;#39;s suffering. I know he&amp;#39;s uncomfortable. I know he&amp;#39;s so so so embarrassed. It&amp;#39;s hard to watch my father shake and cry and pray and vomit and wish he was dead. I don&amp;#39;t want to get my hopes up, as we&amp;#39;ve been here before and I&amp;#39;ve only been let down and hurt numerous times. But I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; hopeful. That he can finally be happy if he continues to really want to get sober and follows through with it. I&amp;#39;m hopeful that maybe this is &lt;em&gt;finally it&lt;/em&gt; for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A social worker at the hospital has got him accepted in a 28-day inpatient program for people with dual disorder (mental health and addiction). Fingers crossed that this is our chance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, and listening.

Usually I'm a confident person but I was too shy to go up and talk to any drunk girls cause I just couldn't see how we'd be able to have a conversation. \n\nI get it. I used to avoid sober people like the plague cause they weren't on my level and thus weren't worth my time. Douchey I know.\n\nI guess the anxiety and doubt I felt was from not knowing how to social sober when I haven't gone to parties or get together sober since my early teenage years. It's like I'm starting from square 1. I used to be the life of the party (usually cause I was the most fucked up) and I just want to recapture that feeling.

I need help and I don&amp;#39;t really know what to do.  Sorry for the length of the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My older brother is a single father to 3 children, an alcoholic, and in poor health.  He has two ex wives.  The first ex-wife is herself a drug addict and unfit to care for the children.  She had custody but lost custody of the 3 kids a handful of years ago due to her addiction and unwillingness to care for the children.  He has a fourth child with a second ex-wife, who told my brother and our family that she was going to bring her new son to a family reunion, but she took the fourth child and never came back.  She and my brother are now divorced and she has full custody of the fourth child, who we haven&amp;#39;t seen in years.  Now my brother is yet again engaged, but this time the girl has all types of health issues, most likely because she abuses medication, but I don&amp;#39;t know as a fact that is the cause of her health problems.  Either way she has shown she is not interested in being a mother figure.  I believe these things have, in part, turned my brother who was an intelligent, capable man into a depressed, angry alcoholic, though he seemingly will never own up to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother has been in the hospital a number of times, each time scarier than the last.  I never really thought of him as an alcoholic, not even after his initial health scares.  I didn&amp;#39;t really see him drink or even drunk, though it did show though in his personality in retrospect.  At first we didn&amp;#39;t take his health situation as seriously as we should have.  Mainly because my brother has become a complete liar, a manipulator who tells people whatever he thinks they want to hear.  He would tell us he was fine and lie to us about what the doctors told him.  Then in fall of last year he fell really sick, so sick he was put into a coma for 3 weeks and couldn&amp;#39;t lie to us.  He almost died in the hospital, we had to transfer him to a better hospital because the one closer to our home town told us there was nothing more they could do, he was going to bleed to death at that hospital.  So we had him transferred to a better, world class hospital.  The doctors at this hospital were amazing, and due to that my brother survived and was checked out of the hospital after 3 weeks.  He has pancreatitis and stage 4 liver cirrhosis.  I am the family member who lives closest to the better hospital, so I was there every day in the mornings talking to the doctors and they made it clear to me that the situation was grim.  If my brother did not overcome his alcoholism and get a new liver, he would likely die within a couple years.  He needed to go to rehab and get a new liver and that was his only long term option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when my brother got out of the hospital he did not immediately go to rehab like my family wanted.  Only because my brother refused, saying he did not have a problem.  I pushed hard for him to go and we would fight about it which has damaged our relationship.  My parents didn&amp;#39;t push as hard because they live with him and his children.  The house is madness with 3 young kids who all have their own behavioral &amp;amp; health issues due to their rough upbringing.  My parents couldn&amp;#39;t stand to fight with my brother over going to rehab, though they did agree with me he should go.  For them, seeing him get better and not drink was enough.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a while, it seemed like he was getting better despite the doctor&amp;#39;s grim diagnosis and him not attending rehab.  Eventually it got to the point where him and his new fiance were going to move away for a period to find jobs and get their health in check, and then they would come back and take the kids.  Some of my family was not supportive of this decision to leave his children behind for months, it seemed like enabling to many of us, but my mom wanted my brother to get some time away because she felt it would be good for his mental health.  Now however, he is states away and things have fallen off the rails.  He has kept postponing his return due to health issues.  His pancreatitis has started flaring up again, but of course he lied to us and said it is because of dehydration and not because he is drinking.  Additionally, he has now gotten a DUI, and chooses to lie to us about it.  His claim is that he was not drunk and that the police screwed up the labeling on his blood test.  An obvious lie.  Looking up his information in the online court case lookup shows he got an &amp;quot;Extreme DUI&amp;quot; and also skipped court for his DUI case; now there is a warrant out for his arrest.  I imagine he will likely do a stint in jail over this DUI &amp;amp; skipping court, meaning he will not be returning home to see his children for who-knows-how-long.  I don&amp;#39;t talk to him much anymore because he lies too much to have a reasonable conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently my mom and dad care for the three children.  Thankfully the second ex-wife is seemingly doing well with the fourth child.  My parents are going to be 70 years old soon.  My dad lost his job of 35 years earlier this year and had to take a new lower paying job, thankfully he was even able to get a new job.  My mom is by far the primary caretaker of the children and as such she only has the time to work a part time job that she is actually able to take the kids to.  She is one hell of a woman, but she cannot keep up the child care forever, her ability to endure is fading as my brothers problems are adding up.  My parents don&amp;#39;t have the patience, energy, or financial resources to handle 3 children and a son who has health and legal issues.  It&amp;#39;s also causing a rift in their relationship as my dad is likely depressed from everything and not as helpful as he could be with the children, and my mom is likely enabling my brother&amp;#39;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am lost on what to do.  How do you help someone that doesn&amp;#39;t want to be helped?  Do you just let them go their own way?  What if I do and he dies?  How would you escape the guilt associated with that?  What about the children?  Even in a best case scenario my brother is not going to be better for years.  My parents can&amp;#39;t care for the kids forever.  So I guess you&amp;#39;re wondering why don&amp;#39;t I care for the kids?  I am scared to death of becoming a parent.  The thought of having to give up my dreams \nbecause of my brothers decisions is something I cant seem to come to terms with.  I would like to see the first ex-wife&amp;#39;s family help out more with the children, but they are also not good people.  We need help but there is nowhere we can easily get it.  I think we need counseling but don&amp;#39;t know whats appropriate or even if my family would go.  It would make sense to get family counseling, but I can imagine also wanting to have 1-on-1 discussions.  I also don&amp;#39;t know the difference between a counselor, therapist, and psychiatrist, but would imagine we will need the help of some third party to get through this.  In a best case scenario my brother goes to rehab for his DUI instead of jail, but how does that process work?  How do you get someone on the list for a new liver?  Are there other states or countries that have a different ethics code in determining priority in getting the transplant?  How can my family ever return to a normal life?  Are we enabling my brother, should we cut him off entirely and move on?  Or does that just feed his depression and alcoholism?  Sorry for this incoherent series of questions, ill end it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening to my ramblings.  Any response or advice is hugely appreciated.

I&amp;#39;d been smoking pot and doing the occasional pill from 16-17 but my final year of high school I got put on randomized drug tests and since I wasn&amp;#39;t an addict yet I could stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately at 19 I got back into the shady side of things and spiraled out of control.

I have Asperger&amp;#39;s that wasn&amp;#39;t diagnosed until I was 31. Now 43. I&amp;#39;ve been drinking since I was 14 because that was the only way I knew to get in touch with my feelings. (Which unfortunately turned out to be deep loneliness, sadness and alienation though that&amp;#39;s not surprising since I cut and was anorexic for many years so clearly &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; was under it.) I&amp;#39;ve tried talk therapy and like most people, I&amp;#39;ve gotten crap therapists and truly awesome ones. The problem is because of my Asperger&amp;#39;s I am a very visual person and so I have a hard time remembering ANYTHING that is said verbally so even if we have a great and insightful discussion, by tomorrow I won&amp;#39;t remember the majority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also tried AA, starting at 16, but with my social anxiety, and the not remembering, that didn&amp;#39;t do much for me, and the deal-breaker for me is that this is a program where to get help YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CALL PEOPLE YOU MAY BARELY KNOW ON THE PHONE!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize it&amp;#39;s the Asperger&amp;#39;s that presents the difficulty for me as it can take me days and usually 2 beers before I can work up the nerve to call ANYONE, even my close family, and I still have to practice beforehand. Phones cause me severe anxiety attacks and at the one job I had with lots of phone answering, I had to practice answering exactly what I would say in the right tone of voice for 2 hours after my first day until I picked someone I could mimic that had a good &amp;quot;phone voice&amp;quot; and could automatically answer with my prepared response. (And that was just answering. God forbid when the conversation started!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like when Monk calls somebody once (I loved the show Monk) and he has 50 different index cards for every possible thing that might come up. Best scene ever for me. LOL. Could relate WAY too much. It&amp;#39;s not a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, needless to say, a program that revolves around &amp;quot;reaching out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;calling people&amp;quot; is probably not going to be much use for the phone-phobic girl with Asperger&amp;#39;s, no matter how lovely the majority of the people are!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do? :(&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am trapped in the most horrible rut here, and I want to get out and know I can, but I don&amp;#39;t know quite how. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any responses appreciated and thank you for your time.

I have Asperger's that wasn't diagnosed until I was 31. Now 43. I've been drinking since I was 14 because that was the only way I knew to get in touch with my feelings. (Which unfortunately turned out to be deep loneliness, sadness and alienation though that's not surprising since I cut and was anorexic for many years so clearly \"something\" was under it.) I've tried talk therapy and like most people, I've gotten crap therapists and truly awesome ones. The problem is because of my Asperger's I am a very visual person and so I have a hard time remembering ANYTHING that is said verbally so even if we have a great and insightful discussion, by tomorrow I won't remember the majority.\n\nI also tried AA, starting at 16, but with my social anxiety, and the not remembering, that didn't do much for me, and the deal-breaker for me is that this is a program where to get help YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CALL PEOPLE YOU MAY BARELY KNOW ON THE PHONE!!\n\nI realize it's the Asperger's that presents the difficulty for me as it can take me days and usually 2 beers before I can work up the nerve to call ANYONE, even my close family, and I still have to practice beforehand. Phones cause me severe anxiety attacks and at the one job I had with lots of phone answering, I had to practice answering exactly what I would say in the right tone of voice for 2 hours after my first day until I picked someone I could mimic that had a good \"phone voice\" and could automatically answer with my prepared response. (And that was just answering. God forbid when the conversation started!) \n\nLike when Monk calls somebody once (I loved the show Monk) and he has 50 different index cards for every possible thing that might come up. Best scene ever for me. LOL. Could relate WAY too much. It's not a joke.\n\nSo, needless to say, a program that revolves around \"reaching out\" and \"calling people\" is probably not going to be much use for the phone-phobic girl with Asperger's, no matter how lovely the majority of the people are!\n\nSo what do? :(\n\nI am trapped in the most horrible rut here, and I want to get out and know I can, but I don't know quite how. \n\nAny responses appreciated and thank you for your time. I am drinking now. :( \n\n(Drinking habits: I am a nurse and work two 12 hour shifts on Friday and Saturday so I NEVER drink those days. I also don't drink on Thursdays so I can detox and make sure I am well rested for my Friday night shift. Then I come home on Sunday and drink a 15 pack of 16 oz. beers and pretty much continue drinking until Weds. when I sober up for work again.

I thought I had but no, there is still a lot of growing I&amp;#39;ve yet to do. Years ago I heard a comedian on a radio talk show detailing his experiences after going through rehab and getting sober. He said once he had sobered up after years of abuse he had to figure out how to be an adult. And that really resonated with me to this day. And in fact I&amp;#39;m living it now to a tee. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quit drinking on December 28th, 2014. I just stopped cold turkey. My body and mind were beyond taxed at that point. I had been very suicidal a few months before and thanks to a friend who I was texting with. I didn&amp;#39;t follow through. And by the end of 2014 my girlfriend left me because she had seen enough of me destroying myself. She needed to move on. To grow. I was still stuck in the ground clutching a vodka bottle and decades of unresolved issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the next morning I just quit. I wasn&amp;#39;t worried about DTs too much as I never gotten to the point of severe alcoholism where my body physically craved it. Not to say I wasn&amp;#39;t drinking at toxic levels, my mom just drank a lot more than me. And her body craved it. The shakes and the vomiting that I was all too familiar with growing up. Watching my mom throw up every morning before getting herself back together for work. Or when she shook so violently from withdrawals I gave her marijuana to calm her down. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just quit. Once I dried out I felt a sense of clarity that had been absent for a long time. I basically pissed away my 20s and 30s partying or partying but really I was super fucking depressed. These were important years in my development. I should have spent that time with working hard and getting ready to have a family. But instead I ran away from adulthood, I told responsibility to go fuck itself, and I told myself I was fine. I wasn&amp;#39;t. And because I wasn&amp;#39;t fine I ignored the huge red flags that everyone around me was sending up. So I just ran it til the wheels fell off thinking that they never would. And they did. And it all came crashing down. Back then I was married to someone I&amp;#39;d been with for 15 years. We did grow apart. Or at least she was trying to grow. I was still stuck in the ground. So we divorced. And I spent the next 7 years bouncing between a raging suicidal drunk and a person seeking redemption. Then I met my current wife. And my attitude changed. I felt like I had a reason to keep trying. Because I had about given up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her and I were both dealing with pain that comes with divorce. But she didn&amp;#39;t self medicate like I did. She didn&amp;#39;t give me too much shit in the beginning of the relationship about my habits. But naturally as the relationship progressed she began to become very concerned. And she helped me as much as any person could when dealing with someone who wants help, but still wants to linger in their pain. To this day I don&amp;#39;t know why my mind wants me to relive the past over and over again. I began to slide in a downward trajectory. She gave it her all but at some point, you gotta walk away. And in December of 2014, she did just that. And I&amp;#39;m glad she did. Because it got me to walk away from a 20 year bender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quit drinking and hit therapy hard. Within a few months her and I were taking again. Soon we married. And I felt complete for once. I was a husband and now a stepfather to her children. I felt like a man. I&amp;#39;d never really felt that feeling before. The feeling of pride. And i thought that I was fine. But by the time the honeymoon ended I was already starting to show wear. Between moving two households and working a lot of extra hours to save up for the wedding and everything involved with setting up a home, I was exhausted. And I was slowly learning what it really takes to run a family. And thanks to my own absentee parents, I was completely flying blind because they taught me nothing. Except for how to run away from your problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my problem isn&amp;#39;t alcohol at all. It&amp;#39;s my own body. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in January if 2017. And I was already burned out and not feeling well from all the hard work my wife and I (mostly her) were doing to keep our ship afloat. So I&amp;#39;m now in constant pain and it has a name. My depression seeped in on top of already pretty bad daily anxiety, and on top of everything else I feel like a fucking fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fraud is the best way I can describe this feeling. It goes back to what that comedian said about learning how to be an adult. I feel like I&amp;#39;m faking it half the time and that&amp;#39;s only because I feel like I have no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing. And I definitely have no idea how to be a dad. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve tried to fake it for so long that it&amp;#39;s impossible to hide my pain. My wife has tremendous resolve and is a true fighter. I&amp;#39;m envious of her strength. But the sad part is, she&amp;#39;s seen my strength and know what I&amp;#39;m capable of. Unfortunately I let my mental health go unchecked for far too long. I&amp;#39;ve stayed off booze. That&amp;#39;s a done deal, no going back and no exceptions. But it&amp;#39;s like my depression came back from a vacation and saw fibromyalgia hanging out and they decided to team up. And they&amp;#39;re a tough team to beat. So here I am in constant physical and mental pain and I don&amp;#39;t even see that my wife had been warning me for months. Just as my ex wife had years ago. So far, I&amp;#39;m kinda failing at being an adult. And my wife has had to fill both roles in my absence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fraud because I sold her a bad piece of real estate. I made promises I didn&amp;#39;t keep. I&amp;#39;ve spent money I shouldn&amp;#39;t have selfishly. I became untrusting of a person I claim to be my best friend with no evidence other than my paranoia. I let her carry the weight. Yeah I went to work and provided but that&amp;#39;s where it ended for me. Yet I&amp;#39;m blaming her for not letting me help. How can she trust a fraud? With her kid&amp;#39;s well being no less. No she has every right to be angry and hurt for what I did and did not do. I broke her heart because I was too busy whining over mine, but she didn&amp;#39;t break mine. It was broken years ago in childhood. And maybe that&amp;#39;s why I can&amp;#39;t grow up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I'm posting some journal entries as a means of healing myself by sharing and to help those that suffer with mental illness.

For the first 3.5 years I drank when I could, but not often, since the legal drinking age is 19 in Ontario. Although I couldn&amp;#39;t drink often at this age, I still had the love for alcohol and would binge any chance I could get- which often resulted in me stealing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most recent years have been a different story. If I could pin point the exact time where my alcohol dependency kicked in full effect, It would be during a stay at my Girlfriends parents place. My GF grabbed a bottle of her Dad&amp;#39;s aged Brandy and poured us each a drink. My drink easily contained 6 shots, topped with mix from a juice box. I grabbed the drink and chugged the whole thing down. Minutes later, I experienced the most insane burst of euphoria I have ever had in my life. Everything was absolutely perfect. The burn in my stomach was enjoyable. I had a huge smile permanently glued to my face- until I went over board and drank more until I found my face in the toilet bowl. I even went out to buy this same bottle when I turned 19 looking for the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was around 19 years old, I decided to drink a crazy amount and act on some stupid decisions- which landed me with a well thought out speech for the judge, an 18 month probation period and a huge scar on my leg. This woke me up from the daze I was in, but I continued drinking after about 5 months. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Late last year I attended a semester in College, and my Girlfriend and I were (and still) living in our own place- which is is great! But, of course with the freedom of having your own home, comes the temptation to drink in the comfort of your own home. Thankfully I passed all of my classes, but understand I would have done better If I wasn&amp;#39;t hungover almost daily. At night the only thing on my mind would be drinking. I don&amp;#39;t attend parties and prefer to only drink alone. When I drink, I usually binge and watch Youtube videos or zone out to music. I&amp;#39;m an introvert forsure, but prefer it this way. My drinks usually consist of 3 shots of white rum mixed with very little coke- always chugged- and many of these throughout a session. I am thankful for my incredibly supportive GF, as she always seems to be finding solutions and explenations for my stupidity due to my alcohol issue. I remember one night my supply ran out, and my ID was no where to be found. So I resorted to throwing our television onto the ground in a rage.

For the first 3.5 years I drank when I could, but not often, since the legal drinking age is 19 in Ontario. Although I couldn't drink often at this age, I still had the love for alcohol and would binge any chance I could get- which often resulted in me stealing alcohol.\n\nThe most recent years have been a different story. If I could pin point the exact time where my alcohol dependency kicked in full effect, It would be during a stay at my Girlfriends parents place. My GF grabbed a bottle of her Dad's aged Brandy and poured us each a drink. My drink easily contained 6 shots, topped with mix from a juice box. I grabbed the drink and chugged the whole thing down. Minutes later, I experienced the most insane burst of euphoria I have ever had in my life. Everything was absolutely perfect. The burn in my stomach was enjoyable. I had a huge smile permanently glued to my face- until I went over board and drank more until I found my face in the toilet bowl. I even went out to buy this same bottle when I turned 19 looking for the same experience.\n\nWhen I was around 19 years old, I decided to drink a crazy amount and act on some stupid decisions- which landed me with a well thought out speech for the judge, an 18 month probation period and a huge scar on my leg. This woke me up from the daze I was in, but I continued drinking after about 5 months. \n\nLate last year I attended a semester in College, and my Girlfriend and I were (and still) living in our own place- which is is great! But, of course with the freedom of having your own home, comes the temptation to drink in the comfort of your own home. Thankfully I passed all of my classes, but understand I would have done better If I wasn't hungover almost daily. At night the only thing on my mind would be drinking. I don't attend parties and prefer to only drink alone. When I drink, I usually binge and watch Youtube videos or zone out to music. I'm an introvert forsure, but prefer it this way. My drinks usually consist of 3 shots of white rum mixed with very little coke- always chugged- and many of these throughout a session. I am thankful for my incredibly supportive GF, as she always seems to be finding solutions and explenations for my stupidity due to my alcohol issue. I remember one night my supply ran out, and my ID was no where to be found. So I resorted to throwing our television onto the ground in a rage. I can assure, this is not sober me.\n\nMy Family is also worried for me; including my Brother who is 18, but also has an alcohol issue (more so partying). Both My Mother and Father do not have a drinking issue- but my Mother's Father does.

Despite that, I am young and it feels unfair that I cannot drink anymore, in principle.

We had a great time organizing our apartment together and trying to pick up where we left off. She had a beer every now and then, and initially I was against it. She seemed to be able to handle herself, as long as she ate, and we didn&amp;#39;t really have any issues. I worked most days, she spent most of the day job hunting. Everything was going fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago, while visiting my mother, she had too much to drink. I could tell on the way home that she was out of sorts, and by the time we got back she was nearly belligerent.

Her uncle, who is honestly the only person in her life that can somehow stand her abuse, bought her a ticket to go back to Oregon this morning.

It is something that has been ingrained in me from an early age. Watching my girlfriend claw at my mother nearly killed me. I had to pry them apart, screaming and crying. I&amp;#39;m not a weak or effeminate man. I am a Longshoreman, military veteran, and generally steadfast in my approach to extreme situations. I couldn&amp;#39;t watch her attack my mother. I pried them apart and we left, leaving my girlfriend in the apartment alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do from here. Her uncle is supposed to be flying out here soon to pack her up and take her back, but he can&amp;#39;t physically make her leave. She&amp;#39;s completely berserk. Should I just stay away, give her uncle access to the apartment and after that no contact?

Looking back I should have just caught the first flight home.\n\nIt took her until Missouri to finally sober up. Upon getting back to NJ, everything turned around. We had a great time organizing our apartment together and trying to pick up where we left off. She had a beer every now and then, and initially I was against it. She seemed to be able to handle herself, as long as she ate, and we didn't really have any issues. I worked most days, she spent most of the day job hunting. Everything was going fine.\n\nThree weeks ago, while visiting my mother, she had too much to drink. I could tell on the way home that she was out of sorts, and by the time we got back she was nearly belligerent. I tried to sleep for work in the morning but she kept me awake all night, turning on lights and terrorizing me as I tried to sleep.\n\nFor the past three weeks we have been fighting. I keep finding liquor bottles stashed around the house, she is physically abusive and completely out of touch with reality. I have been sleeping at friends' houses, at my mother's, and in my car at the parking lot at work. Her uncle, who is honestly the only person in her life that can somehow stand her abuse, bought her a ticket to go back to Oregon this morning. My mother came to my apartment with her husband this morning to help me get my girlfriend ready for her flight. The scene erupted in a disaster as my mother and girlfriend wrestled around the apartment, fighting to get my naked girlfriend to put her clothes on. \n\nI do not hit women. It is something that has been ingrained in me from an early age. Watching my girlfriend claw at my mother nearly killed me. I had to pry them apart, screaming and crying. I'm not a weak or effeminate man. I am a Longshoreman, military veteran, and generally steadfast in my approach to extreme situations. I couldn't watch her attack my mother. I pried them apart and we left, leaving my girlfriend in the apartment alone.\n\nI don't know what to do from here. Her uncle is supposed to be flying out here soon to pack her up and take her back, but he can't physically make her leave. She's completely berserk. Should I just stay away, give her uncle access to the apartment and after that no contact? I'm completely traumatized from the ordeal - never in my life did I think I'd be in a situation like this. Is this my fault? Should I have never trusted her to begin with?", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6lxeoa", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I need some help.", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 4, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6lxeoa", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/6lxeoa/i_need_some_help/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1499497437.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/6lxeoa/i_need_some_help/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "Ubiquibot", "created_utc": 1499468637.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I am not an alcoholic, and consider myself to be competently managing my drinking, so I&amp;#39;m trying to understand and support.

I think if she doesn&amp;#39;t, then she&amp;#39;s already on track to figuring out replacing one substance use issue with another. I also think she needs to talk to her husband, and that she needs to address her substance use issues. I think therapist -&amp;gt; husband -&amp;gt; substance use issues is the most likely order of things, from easiest to hardest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions for how to help get her to work on this? Reading material? (Especially if in e-book format, since then she can read stuff on her phone without her husband seeing; baby steps.) Personal experiences?

Are they the only option? I know alcohol is her self-medicating for other issues; does it make more sense to tell her I won&amp;#39;t drink with her anymore before she&amp;#39;s doing anything to deal with those issues, or is it better to make sure she&amp;#39;s got support around her while she is drinking and getting a handle on those issues?

When I get there, I get let in by staff and see the event manager who takes me to my wife, and the people that are looking after her. I was shocked, I&amp;#39;ve seen her in states before but she was almost unresponsive at this point (eyes open and moving around but not having a clue what was going on), tell the event manager while I&amp;#39;ve seen her drunk I&amp;#39;ve never seen her this bad, she calls an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ambulance arrives, at this point Wife has started being slightly coherent, but is still very very drunk. They check her Blood pressure, Pluse and look at her eyes. We end up going to A&amp;amp;E as the ambulance crew weren&amp;#39;t sure if she&amp;#39;d had any illegal substances. She bit me a couple of times and hit me in the ambulance. I&amp;#39;m not bothered about that, it&amp;#39;s a one time incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were there for several hours, and she starts slowly sobering up, at about 9:30pm we are asked to leave the cubical we were in and go back in the waiting area. Once we are sat down wife at this point starts getting slightly angry (currently just towards me that we are in a waiting area). Hospital here have a zero tolerence on physical and verbal abuse. I&amp;#39;m not sure if she would have been verbally abusive to staff, however if we stayed I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s have started shouting at me and making a scene, to diffuse that I say we&amp;#39;ll leave. So we do. Because we self discharged we don&amp;#39;t know her blood results, so don&amp;#39;t know blood alcohol level/if she had any illegal substances (however knowing her quite well she was just drunk) We get home and she&amp;#39;s know passed out in bed. But as I&amp;#39;ve said before I&amp;#39;ve never seen her that drunk before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You maybe thinking that I&amp;#39;m worrying a little too much, however if this were her proper job I know she wouldn&amp;#39;t be going back tomorrow as she&amp;#39;d be fired. She&amp;#39;s actually lost 4 full time jobs due to being drunk/drinking (She works in bars/hospitality) in the time I&amp;#39;ve known her which is 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the past few months her alcohol consumption has gotten a lot higher, and if she has any booze left over from the previous night she&amp;#39;ll now drink it in the morning, in terms of volume that can be anything from half a bottle of wine, to quarter bottle of gin. She drinks most nights, and gets particularly drunk if I&amp;#39;m out for the evening. She will get blackout drunk quite often, and also her moods can be bad while drunk, if we are at home and she starts getting moody I&amp;#39;ll just try remove myself from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the years we&amp;#39;ve been together I&amp;#39;ve had several people (strangers mostly, friends of friends) contact me saying she&amp;#39;s too drunk in town, what&amp;#39;s your address so I can get her in a taxi. She&amp;#39;s also been arrested for drunk and disorderly , in which she would have lost another job if I didn&amp;#39;t lie to her boss about what had happened. I have told her in the past that I&amp;#39;m concerned about the intake however she just laughs it off pretty much.

I was already killing the pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drank some more in the year after it, most at nights out still, yet kept drinking some more. Eventually my health got worst, and drinking was amazing in helping. More years of this, kept getting worst, drinking so much you have no idea, would end all nights in a bar, dressed like a bum chugging beer. Started to get hungovers (had none before), started to get tired, slept the next day after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Valium taken for a month or 2 can get an alcoholic feeling great and after not craving it or a lot less. Problem is i was already on benzos for years. Nothing worked, same root to self destruction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 years ago i found about Subutex, a pseudo opiate that helped H\\opiate\\opioids quit it. This medicine is Not easy to get. It was Bliss. No more craving, it buprenorfine in it pseudo morphine. No more craving or wanting to drink, feeling good from it, exercise again, eating good. Social life, got girlfriend. Eventually started snorting it for more bang a buck, taking a bit more some times over the day. Eventually i was a junkie, snorting it some  times a day, poor health so needed to rest/sleep the day after. Had to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I detoxed from it, wasn&amp;#39;t very hard because i had quit benzos so now they worked. Afterwards life was kinda pointless, depression returned. Lost gf, stopped wanting to socialize, just stay at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there it was, again, available for me, Alcohol. Same old same old, drink, drink more untill eventually drink all days, huge withdrawals. Nothing worked again. Some 2 months ago my doctor got me on Subutex again to stop drinking completely. Has worked so far, but low dosage, yet even so every dosage i take i pay the price e.g. take it 3 days a row, the 4th i sleep a whole day with my usual hellish nightmares. So now i&amp;#39;m taking a bit more than recomended. I feel good for the day, until i pay the price. My physical health is miserable, can only manage to eat some cereal or fruit and yogurt. Am so weak its hard to walk when i go outside, like walk 20 minutes is hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to do some exercise using subu for endorfins etc exercise is a saviour. But i won&amp;#39;t be able to, i&amp;#39;m saying so because i&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;high&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m actually writting this because so.

I came home from a trip last week and found her passed out next to an empty bottle... I woke her up, put her in the shower and thankfully she woke enough to make herself throw up. Since then, she is acting pissed with me and is acting like &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; did something wrong. We spoke briefly and she says it is my fault for always being gone (I travel for work) and she gets &amp;quot;bored&amp;quot;. The truth is I have known she had a problem with alcohol for a long time but because she has maintained her job and seemed fine otherwise, it didn&amp;#39;t dawn on me that her problem was getting worse. Anyway I have not been around to witness her behavior on a daily basis... but I have noticed things have been &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; in the house so I did suspect something was up lately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if it is her depression or just the addiction getting stronger but it has begun to bleed into her day-to-day life and she can&amp;#39;t hide it anymore. This is not the first time it has happened either - There have actually been several red flags over the years. This is just the last time I am willing to ignore it and pretend she has a handle on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Kick her out?

I came home from a trip last week and found her passed out next to an empty bottle... I woke her up, put her in the shower and thankfully she woke enough to make herself throw up. Since then, she is acting pissed with me and is acting like *I* did something wrong. We spoke briefly and she says it is my fault for always being gone (I travel for work) and she gets \"bored\". The truth is I have known she had a problem with alcohol for a long time but because she has maintained her job and seemed fine otherwise, it didn't dawn on me that her problem was getting worse. Anyway I have not been around to witness her behavior on a daily basis... but I have noticed things have been \"off\" in the house so I did suspect something was up lately. \n\nI am not sure if it is her depression or just the addiction getting stronger but it has begun to bleed into her day-to-day life and she can't hide it anymore. This is not the first time it has happened either - There have actually been several red flags over the years. This is just the last time I am willing to ignore it and pretend she has a handle on it. \n\nI don't know what to do. Kick her out?

Not as the best man, but certainly on the party itself.  The problem is that he is a very serious alcoholic.  He&amp;#39;s 31 now, and it started to get really serious in his early 20&amp;#39;s. Here&amp;#39;s some background information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s tried college, culinary and tech school, but flunked out of each of them due to alcohol.  He has also lost several jobs due to drinking, and has not had a full time job for more than a week since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem really exacerbated in 2014 when we lost our father in a tractor accident.  He continued to live our Mother (who was also an alcoholic).  He didn&amp;#39;t work, didn&amp;#39;t go to school, and would occasionally steal from her to buy more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our Mother passed away last year on May 8 (which was ironically Mother&amp;#39;s day).  He moved in with me and a lot of those behaviors continued.  He didn&amp;#39;t get a job, despite my pressuring to night and day.  He stole loose change from me to buy alcohol, he got into my closet and drank a bottle of whiskey that I had specially made for me in Ireland.  On multiple I would come home from work and he would be blacked out drunk.  Living with him in my apartment was an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister and I did everything we could think of to help him.  We took him to AA and Alanon meetings.  We took him job searching, even creating an uber account so he could go to interviews etc before he could get a car.  We eventually learned from the folks at Alanon that trying to help someone who doesn&amp;#39;t want the help is futile and will only start affecting your own mental health.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I came home one night and just said that this situation is not working, and we&amp;#39;ll have to find alternative arrangements for him.  I gave him a month, and we were able to find a small one bedroom apartment nearby.  I was able to co-sign the lease, and he is paying rent with a $40K life insurance policy that we received from the passing of our Mother.  My Sister helped him get a car with money from the same life insurance policy.  So right now he is on his own to make his own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately these behaviors are continuing.  He isn\u2019t working, or doing anything to get a job.  He is impossible to get a hold of because he ignores his phone both sober and drunk.  And his apartment is trashed and disgusting.  He goes on benders of 3-4 days and is completely dead to the world during those stretches.  Everytime he promises to do something for us he lets us down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here\u2019s the dilemma.  I love my brother and want him to be one of my groomsmen.  I don\u2019t know if he is capable enough, or reliable enough to be one.  Should I set some rules and stipualations? Is the risk too great to have him on at all?  Has anyone run into a similar problem? If so, how did you handle it?\nTL:DR I\u2019d like my Brother to be one of my groomsmen, but I don\u2019t know if I can trust him due to his alcoholism.

We eventually learned from the folks at Alanon that trying to help someone who doesn't want the help is futile and will only start affecting your own mental health.  \n\nEventually I came home one night and just said that this situation is not working, and we'll have to find alternative arrangements for him.  I gave him a month, and we were able to find a small one bedroom apartment nearby.  I was able to co-sign the lease, and he is paying rent with a $40K life insurance policy that we received from the passing of our Mother.  My Sister helped him get a car with money from the same life insurance policy.  So right now he is on his own to make his own decisions.\n\nUnfortunately these behaviors are continuing.  He isn\u2019t working, or doing anything to get a job.  He is impossible to get a hold of because he ignores his phone both sober and drunk.  And his apartment is trashed and disgusting.  He goes on benders of 3-4 days and is completely dead to the world during those stretches.  Everytime he promises to do something for us he lets us down.\n\nSo here\u2019s the dilemma.  I love my brother and want him to be one of my groomsmen.  I don\u2019t know if he is capable enough, or reliable enough to be one.  Should I set some rules and stipualations? Is the risk too great to have him on at all?  Has anyone run into a similar problem? If so, how did you handle it?\nTL:DR I\u2019d like my Brother to be one of my groomsmen, but I don\u2019t know if I can trust him due to his alcoholism.  How best to approach this?\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6jmkv2", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "I'm getting married.

In the beginning of our relationship we were always going out and having fun on the weekends. With the work we do, it&amp;#39;s necessary sometimes to just go out and blow off some steam by getting drunk on a Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During that time I, who can be a pretty big drinker every once in a while, noticed that my boyfriend could go really hard almost all of the time. I chalked it up to him just being a British lad and knowing that&amp;#39;s what they do back in his hometown in England. I&amp;#39;m from the US so I&amp;#39;ve seen my fair share of all night drinkers, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After we moved in together was when I started noticing that the drinking happened a lot more than I thought. Now, he has a very prominent job in his company and he&amp;#39;s damn good at it. He never gets drunk before work but he would smash through 3-6 tall boys every night after work. At this point I had reserved myself to drinking on special occasions or when we had our big office parties as I can feel myself taking longer and longer to get over hangovers. But after a while his drinking started hurting our sex life. He could never keep it up and he would snore so loud that I&amp;#39;d be forced into the spare bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all came to a head when I, unfortunately, drunkenly brought it up one night after a work party. After some heated words that were almost all forgotten, we slept it off and we talked about what happened sober and he agreed that he might have a problem. He said he liked the taste of it and I asked if he ever thought he could go to a dinner and just casually have one and he said he didn&amp;#39;t think he could. At that point he acknowledged that it was definitely the reason for our dead bedroom and that he&amp;#39;d reserve it to just the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first week he tried it he did really well. But then that weekend came and he went harder than I&amp;#39;ve ever seen him go. I was worried a bit but not a lot because he had done so well during the week. But every week since he&amp;#39;s managed to sneak in a drink at home during the week days by saying stuff like &amp;quot;It was such a stressful day. I need a stiff one at home.&amp;quot; Now, I don&amp;#39;t doubt that he has stressful days, I know he does. But he&amp;#39;s slowly gone back to his old pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This weekend was a big weekend for drinking. One of our couple friends moved away, so we had a goodbye party for them, and the next day he had a &amp;quot;Managers Only&amp;quot; dinner for his job. Those things usually get out of hand and are seen as legendary for all those who have a chance to attend. I told him at the beginning of the week that he should probably save himself for those two nights and maybe not even drink at the goodbye dinner. He agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead he drank almost every day leading up to it and then got absolutely smashed both nights. (I ended up not drinking as much at the goodbye dinner knowing that he was going to go pretty hard.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do about this or whether or not to bring it up again. I feel almost like a hypocrite, though, because where I can drink, it&amp;#39;s not my vice. I prefer to smoke pot. But the difference is that if I&amp;#39;m out of it, I can go weeks or months without smoking. Besides the week after I confronted him, I haven&amp;#39;t seen my boyfriend go a day without drinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to just dump him because this is a relationship we&amp;#39;ve both worked hard in and I don&amp;#39;t want to leave him during a time when he&amp;#39;d need support. But on the other hand, I&amp;#39;ve completely lost my attraction to him. I feel like we&amp;#39;re just roommates and not really lovers and I think most of this stems from the fact that we&amp;#39;re not having sex anymore because of his drinking. And that I feel like I&amp;#39;m constantly caring for him because of how often he&amp;#39;s drunk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I guess my question is, what is the next step to getting through to him? Do I talk to him again and hope he&amp;#39;ll stay sober longer this time? Do I strike a deal with him and quit smoking if he agrees to quit drinking? Going to an AA meeting/getting counseling is hard because we&amp;#39;re both expats in a new country right now and English speakers are few and far between.

The last time was May 12th. I was kind of wishy washy to say &amp;quot;one month sober&amp;quot; because I hadn&amp;#39;t drank much on May 12th. But, I have wanted to quit altogether since January so no amount of alcohol was acceptable, including only having two drinks at a celebration for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is kind of a painful story with heartbreak and mental illness all wrapped in, but here is the short version. I used to be a heavy drinker in social situations. It intensified as my mental health started slipping in the face of a girl I loved becoming more and more distant from me and me realizing she probably did not love me as much as I loved her. When I told her how I felt, she didn&amp;#39;t. And my drinking, which had already gotten pretty intense by that point, and I was mixing it with Valium, got way worse. A few  weeks later, at her birthday party, I was way out of it and  got absolutely trashed on beer and valium and had to be taken care of. Then when someone I didn&amp;#39;t know agreed to drive me home I started hysterically crying and I think told him I was going to end my life... which I had seriously been considering. The next day she and another friend took me to the hospital. After I was discharged, she was the third person in like a month to tell me I needed to stop drinking and said she thought I should go to AA. While I was in the hospital, I was very closely monitored for alcohol dependency. It was a real wake up call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I was discharged, I stayed sober for about a month.

The last time was May 12th. I was kind of wishy washy to say \"one month sober\" because I hadn't drank much on May 12th. But, I have wanted to quit altogether since January so no amount of alcohol was acceptable, including only having two drinks at a celebration for a friend.\n\nIt is kind of a painful story with heartbreak and mental illness all wrapped in, but here is the short version. I used to be a heavy drinker in social situations. It intensified as my mental health started slipping in the face of a girl I loved becoming more and more distant from me and me realizing she probably did not love me as much as I loved her. When I told her how I felt, she didn't. And my drinking, which had already gotten pretty intense by that point, and I was mixing it with Valium, got way worse. A few  weeks later, at her birthday party, I was way out of it and  got absolutely trashed on beer and valium and had to be taken care of. Then when someone I didn't know agreed to drive me home I started hysterically crying and I think told him I was going to end my life... which I had seriously been considering. The next day she and another friend took me to the hospital. After I was discharged, she was the third person in like a month to tell me I needed to stop drinking and said she thought I should go to AA. While I was in the hospital, I was very closely monitored for alcohol dependency. It was a real wake up call.\n\nAfter I was discharged, I stayed sober for about a month. Then I started relapsing and drinking weekly -- at times in large amounts. I kept trying to stop. Now I've managed for a month. Part of it is because my social life has been dead. But I am going to go out Wednesday, I think, to an event i saw on meetup.com. I hope I can stay sober...

Nothing creepy or anything, it&amp;#39;s actually really cute, but I do wonder why this happens. I&amp;#39;ve never been drunk so I don&amp;#39;t know how it&amp;#39;s like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad, when sober, doesn&amp;#39;t show his emotions. I mean, he&amp;#39;ll tease my older siblings and I and he always makes the typical &amp;quot;dad jokes&amp;quot; but he won&amp;#39;t go out of his way to tell us he loves us or he won&amp;#39;t hug us out of the blue like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, when drunk, he only gets affectionate with me, despite being seemingly closer to my older sister who&amp;#39;s 27. He isn&amp;#39;t affectionate with my mom either. It&amp;#39;s really just me (and my dog, but does my dog count? lol)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;m asking this because this just happened. He knocked on my bedroom door and when I opened the door, he hugged me and said &amp;quot;There there.&amp;quot; while also rubbing the back of my head. I cried this morning because of a stupid thing and only my brother saw it, I pretended I was fine after this. But I think my brother told my parents when I left so that&amp;#39;s probably what triggered the hug haha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not worried or anything like that by the way, I think it&amp;#39;s just a funny/cute thing my dad does when he drinks a bit too much. But I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder if there&amp;#39;s any psychological explanation for it? I&amp;#39;d like to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that info can help, I&amp;#39;m the only person who didn&amp;#39;t call my dad out for drinking.

Nothing creepy or anything, it's actually really cute, but I do wonder why this happens. I've never been drunk so I don't know how it's like.\n\nMy dad, when sober, doesn't show his emotions. I mean, he'll tease my older siblings and I and he always makes the typical \"dad jokes\" but he won't go out of his way to tell us he loves us or he won't hug us out of the blue like that. \n\nAlso, when drunk, he only gets affectionate with me, despite being seemingly closer to my older sister who's 27. He isn't affectionate with my mom either. It's really just me (and my dog, but does my dog count? lol)\n\nAnyway, I'm asking this because this just happened. He knocked on my bedroom door and when I opened the door, he hugged me and said \"There there.\" while also rubbing the back of my head. I cried this morning because of a stupid thing and only my brother saw it, I pretended I was fine after this. But I think my brother told my parents when I left so that's probably what triggered the hug haha.\n\nI'm not worried or anything like that by the way, I think it's just a funny/cute thing my dad does when he drinks a bit too much. But I can't help but wonder if there's any psychological explanation for it? I'd like to know.\n\nIf that info can help, I'm the only person who didn't call my dad out for drinking. I always leave him be and I talk to him when he's drunk as if he wasn't, when the rest of my family will easily get annoyed by him drinking and be passive-aggressive or just plain rude. So maybe that's also a reason? I don't want to read too much into it though, I'm just really curious. \n\n(ps: my dad drinks for many issues he's dealing with irl and he's still reasonable most of the time. taking this away from him would not only make him really anxious but also angry. i know it's bad but i can't make him change if he doesn't want to.. just wanted to clear that out.)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "6g98ko", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "title": "Why does my dad hug me when he's drunk?", "num_crossposts": 0, "saved": false, "can_mod_post": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 9, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rgl1", "hide_score": false, "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "contest_mode": false, "gilded": 0, "locked": false, "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "secure_media_embed": {}, "removal_reason": null, "visited": false, "can_gild": false, "thumbnail_height": null, "name": "t3_6g98ko", "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/alcoholism/comments/6g98ko/why_does_my_dad_hug_me_when_hes_drunk/", "num_reports": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "created": 1497052091.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/6g98ko/why_does_my_dad_hug_me_when_hes_drunk/", "author_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "author": "smoofsmooff", "created_utc": 1497023291.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/alcoholism", "distinguished": null, "media": null, "mod_reports": [], "is_self": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "subreddit_type": "public", "is_video": false, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.alcoholism", "approved_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "subreddit": "alcoholism", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just looking for some advice on this - I know you will tell me to go see a Dr., but I can&amp;#39;t afford to at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 34 year old caucasian male, 193 pounds, 190.5 cm. body fat 16.9%\nOver the past year I have had a dull ache below my ribs on my right hand side.
