What concept completely blows your mind?
The concept of the observable universe. The fact that the reason we can't see a certain range into the space being because the light hasn't had time to get to earth since the beginning of the universe is crazy to me.
So you mean the universe is buffering for us?
Wow, now your analogy blew my mind!

Nah it's more like the draw distance.
this comment literally made the whole observable universe thing actually make sense to me for the first time. cheers.
Your comment just blew my mind into milky way chunks.
Oh. Damn.
Holy shit o.o
I guarantee the universe is gonna put itself behind a paywall very soon
There is an horizon beyond which we will never be able to see no matter how long the universe runs for.It is one of the unsolved cosmological problems. If there are boundaries beyond which no information will ever pass then how did the universe end up homogeneous?
Not really.
