concept completely blow mind?
concept observable universe. fact reason can't see certain range space light time get earth since beginning universe crazy me.
mean universe buffering us?
wow, analogy blew mind!
want godamit! gluurrraaa grrraaaa
/r/showerthoughts
nah like draw distance.
comment literally made whole observable universe thing actually make sense first time. cheers.
comment blew mind milky way chunks.
oh. damn.
holy shit o.o
guarantee universe gonna put behind paywall soon
horizon beyond never able see matter long universe run for.it one unsolved cosmological problems. boundary beyond information ever pas universe end homogeneous?
really.
holy shit means? never gave much thought always assumed 'observable universe' furthest accurately see information becomes small distorted great distance.
even crazier that. due expansion universe, everthing outside observable universe moving faster speed light away us. mean light rest universe never reach us. live ever shrinking bubble local galaxies. everything around u literally fade existence (since definition, can't ever observe it, exist) relative speed u rest galaxy pass speed light.edit ton response thread. i've posted link elsewhere, figured i'd put well. explained way, way better could ever hope to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbr4gkrny04 difference see, far away object currently are, long going on, wide visible universe is, etc. basic point same. outside radius place universe, rest universe expanding away u greater speed light. light part universe never reach us, never reach them. forever isolated bubble.if think simulation theory universe, ingenious way contain u without walls.
baffle me. knowledge stuff severely limited thing i've told/ read/ watched, remember one episode cosmos (the new one), ndt mentioned nothing could ever go faster light. think situation portrayed could travel 99.9999~% speed light bike, switch headlight, light leaving headlight would still traveling speed light. since brought though, wondering well. universe expanding rapidly, could expand rate light overcome rate expansion? could, happens light traveling opposite direction? mean i'm car going 25 mph throw ball window going 25 mph opposite direction, it'd appear like ball standing still someone outside, right (not taking gravity account)? could light theoretically standing still somewhere universe? i'm sorry babbling part, screw mind sort ways. edit: holy expletive, love reddit community. thanks helpful answer everyone!
galaxy thing "moving faster speed light away us" moving space/time faster speed light, moving fast space/time expanding. individual stars, planets, asteroid moving space faster light speed, fabric space/time expanding faster light. although i'm entirely sure space actually expanding fast right now, know continually increasing rate expansion eventually (if already) break barrier. "nothing travel faster light" rule still holds, rule talking thing moving space, space itself. hopefully explained adequately.
informative detailed answer. think understand explanation space container, expanding. light, content container still adhere rule inside container, different rule apply container itself? sorry keep reverting comparisons, way sort make sense things.
yeah, pretty much it. analogy get used lot blow balloon draw dot it. dot representing galaxy balloon surface representing space itself. blow balloon further, expands, dot (galaxies) get farther away one another. however, dot actually moved.
exactly happens. space/time bound speed light limit. turn out, object 14.7 billion light year away moving away u faster speed light. old universe? 14.7 billion years.... another crazy thing. hear inflation, universe expanded faster light. well, universe always always expanding faster light. great youtube video subject. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbr4gkrny04
thanks helpful answer, video explained thing quite nicely.
13.7 edit: apparently accepted figure 13.83 billion year age universe.
knew facts, never combined head. course universe always expanded faster light! learned something!
fact, fact spacetime bound speed light may allow human devise way faster-than-light travel.
possible universe even older that, can't know can't observe it?
no. light always traveling speed light observer. i. e. way light could ever measured going anything c
galaxy moving away space expanding. space created. light coming towards u can't travel fast space literally made. imagine running person b floor getting bigger faster run. even though covering distance, ever going getting away. galaxy moving away they're flying away u faster speed light, space occupy carrying away. confusion thing moving away (travelling across distance) opposed space expanding (distance created).
think watch videos. alan guth vast cosmos? 12 minute living multiverse? anthony aguirre (seti talks) 1 hour 16 minute
thanks this, going give watch.
dude seti video awesome! channel like this? give long talks? currently drive lot, i'm looking itneresting lectures/podcasts lisnte way.

nice, thanks! use podcast republic, think podcast addict. good suggestions, i'll def check
light can't keep rate expansion. yes, that's observable universe finite, even decreasing. light end universe never reach us, ever, due expansion. like ball standing still air analogy. two train pas eachother going 60 mile hour. stationary one train. see pass, appears going 120 away you, really isn't, going 60 away eachother. similarly solar system moving away another solar system, turn moving away us, half speed light. point view solar system, would seem traveling away faster speed light. therefore light one never reach other. relativity mind-bendy like that.
mental visual helped lot actually. still blow mind try understand though. know probably works, one end universe x y, distance two point expanding continuously, must force sort driving two away eachother, force constantly accelerating. guess one mistake using distance understand trying apply space itself, unfathomable otherwise. love thinking things, much drive crazy.
???
two body moving opposite direction speed x relative third body, relative reach moving speed slightly le x+y. verified experimentally putting synchronized clock beacon them.
i've learned relativity lorentz transformation, reality work like that. travelling half speed light shine light forward, light beam still going speed light, similarly, shine light backward, still going speed light. factor "observable universe" know. i'm programmer, physicist.
i'm talking two object traveling away eachother half speed light. granted imperfect analogy since much object traveling, space expanding, sake argument let's ignore that. two object traveling away eachother half speed light never able see eachother. like shining light behind opposed ahead you, travelling speed light, anyone else would able see light they're location started traveling speed turned light. again, ignoring whole space expanding thing break analogy degree, simple visualization get idea concept. could totally wrong. reconcile idea there's part universe never see they're "moving" away u greater speed light.
???
ah. learn something new day. think analogy accurate since entirely ignores whole space expanding thing, make easier grasp whole observable universe concept
think situation portrayed could travel 99.9999~% speed light bike, switch headlight, light leaving headlight would still traveling speed light. relative relative stationary observer?
idea honest, though i'd guess speed leaving 99.9999%-speed-of-light-traveling object would still going speed light leaving stationary object. totally guessing, answer seems case? try make sense this, confusing seems get. confusing good way, still confusing.
would guess relative comment: no. light always traveling speed light observer. i. e. way light could ever measured going anything c c constant speed light travel at.
would love read book related this, i'm somewhere depressed doomsday prophet (i hard time thinking everything come end, make thing pointless, etc.) actually fascinates lot. give hope, weirdly enough. got book tip general science around subject?
i've posted link another response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbr4gkrny04 channel lot informative video
i'll check out, thanks!
channel friggin awesome! thanks. similar channel like (maybe geared towards universe related topics) slightly longer? drive lot would like something listen to.
think called big rip hypothesis! eventually, subatomic particle far apart interact, resulting "big rip" force universe collapse inwardly itself! scientist believe creates dense singularity explodes outwards can't contain much energy, event already happened (perhaps several time before): big bang.
sub reddit dedicated cool fact universe? /space seems good wondered
that's thing blow mind. nothing travel faster speed light.... yet, matter moving away u faster speed light. still cannot reconcille this. closest i've come someone saying stuff can't move faster, space can. still make head hurt.
kind make feel small little bit.
wait galaxy traveling father us?
:(
two questions: 1) moving faster light? unless mean expansion occurs fast, impression object containing mass could move faster light. 2) since something observed physically order exist?
due expansion universe, everthing outside observable universe moving faster speed light away u come move faster speed light?
thought nothing could go faster speed light?
okay, bare here, claim working knowledge power be. but, still able see them? car moving speed light away me, someone car quickly turned light bulb off, would light still travel direction (including own) speed light? basically, still able see galaxies, extreme time lag? idk, understanding can't add subtract speed light. stuff confuses though, sorry i'm way base.
say "passes speed light" saying reach speed light, go faster speed light? impression nothing could go faster speed light. correct?
that's always thought too! matter human incapability rather physical incapability.
veritasium video, help this.
time google it... rabbit hole go. shit amazingly crazy
totally spoiled astronomy young age... know, everything cool layman say woah without excessive math degrees, completely drowned googling everything could think of. simply effect, remember school science thing space guy laid mind blowing stuff, black holes, giant stars, etc everyone blown away like wish could live mindblowingness :c tldr right
sound like need google even stuff.
seems valid.
mention without light able reach u information exchanged, thus casual relationship u anything past certain distance. now, ever. meaning intent purpose may well two separate universes.
weirdest thing space expands point space.. every object moving away (the red shift). mean point space moving away exponentially mean what's observable observable future.
nope observable mean region exchange information kind ever.
there's joke somewhere op's mom ensuring observable universe infinite.
almost. observable universe area area currently able observe, case yet. observable universe "shrinking", sort of. region currently observable future, universe expanding accelerating rate, eventually region expanding away u faster speed light. happening constantly. area see getting bigger, actually becoming empty.
ever actually seen galaxy disappear?
afaik, completely dissappear? no. span time capable making observation tiny comparison. see effect action however, object away getting red shifted, quicker closer ones.
anyone proposed explanation universe expanding faster rate? seems fucky me. one part astronomical theory can't get head around.
lot suggestions, one best fit evidence seen. seems odd disjointed world typically interact with. honestly take abstract look, thing like gravity freaking weird too, stuff seems pull self towards stuff, normal interact daily.
smart guy explained theory might possible, quite liked (although still questions). try explain technically i'm sure year later justice, i'm also sure exactly timeline indeed spatially, concept show distant matter would speed ever faster away centre centre's perspective point time. hopefully new come condescending! big bang occurs. stuff rocketing outwards great speed. outermost layer fairly dense, everything 'within' outer layer amount stuff layer itself. imagine u vaguely central, least within central mass, one speck great amount stuff universe. initially stuff moving outward x speed result big bang. stuff closer centre experience gravitational interference pull remain central result stuff around central area, gradually, everything slows down, experienced rapidly stuff closest centre (due stuff centre imaginary sphere compared surface). so, relatively, appears u outermost stuff speeding away faster ever actually happened retained original x speed have, moving away u sped up. eventually central stuff slow down, stop, reverse direction towards centre, central density increase slowing effect outer object increase, eventually leading stoppage gradual acceleration back towards centre. outermost layer retains speed longest, helping keep speed next closest layer/s (possible outermost layer contains lot stuff,
yea, mom went shopping.
irekt
find amazing gravity travel faster light either. body universe yet know going attracted (except drift apart never "know")
wife short year ago.
raise question, exist can't perceived way? boggles mind. like, one know inside empty room look like. [4]
know, universe expanding faster speed light, knowledge size observable universe shrinking (objects red-shifted invisibility going sight), construe stuff beyond observable universe. much way shut eyes, throw ball empty room close door, still know ball room.
still perceiving ball using sens (hearing, feeling, etc..). beyond observable universe way possibly perceiving what's there, therefore way knowing what's there.
actually can't infer based interaction edge observable universe? make two borders. observable inferred inferred unobservable.
like throwing ball window knowing there's ball outside.
expanding faster speed light, expanding faster faster rate.
galaxy approximately 4.5 gigaparsecs (14.7 billion light-years) away u expanding away u faster light. high rate expansion, also possible distance two object greater value calculated multiplying speed light age universe wikipedia
no. given two object separated enough space, two object moving away speed greater speed light. live observable bubble. everything outside bubble moving away u faster speed light never see light produced.
aka dark energy
place expanding quickly causing movement galaxy away u faster light speed. that, never able see galaxies! :)
somewhat perceived, directly. galaxy edge observe still affected gravity a, it, nearby neighbouring galaxy far away u see. see distant galaxy math conclude must something else there.
observe galaxy 10 billion light year away. person galaxy observe milky way galaxy 10 billion light year away him. however, galaxy 20 billion light year away you, light reached yet. check back 7 billion years.
i'd never even considered this. fuuuuuuuuuck.
schroidinger's universe?
put camera room look one there?
still able observe room using sight hearing, via camera. beyond observable universe there's way comprehend exists there.
that's different originally implied: something exist observed.
know said know empty room look like, know empty room look like. idea whether object space exist observed different issue.
perceived, u :)
think empty seriousness though, can't perceived u mean different location.
could put camera room... saying... i'll se out.
exist can't perceived way? realize earth existed anyone around observe it, right?
