Texas serial bomber made video confession before blowing himself up                             
What are the chances we ever see the video?                                                     
About the same as the chances of the Browns winning the Super Bowl.                           
I take the browns to the super bowl every morning.                                              
I have to applaud your regularity                                                               
I thought at first you meant he posts that comment regularly. But now I get it. Healthy colon.  
Consistency is the key.                                                                         
Pshh I'm taking the browns to the super bowl as we speak                                        
Seriously. Well done.                                                                           
Notice no one here shit talking how the Browns are going all the way this year?                 
All the way to the #1 overall pick. Again

Actually, they're going to number 2.                                                                                                             
They run too many nutty plays and tend to break apart in the last quarter.                                                                       
They know how to make a run in a pinch.                                                                                                          
They spend too much time trying to shoot the gap. Usually the hole gets plugged before they break free.                                          
I feel like they have a chance to win 4 or so games this year, so maybe 2-3 pick. They made some really nice moves in FA but did lose Joe Thomas 

To be fair, with that roster they should at least be a 6 game winning team this year, but with that coach they'll always look like the 1-31 team they are with him.                                                                   
The guy you replied to is definitely shit talking about the Browns going to the Superbowl.                                                                                                                                            
They are definitely going to win........a game.                                                                                                                                                                                       
I would also take those odds for the off chance its sunny in Albany                                                                                                                                                                   
hey, I'm doing that right now                                                                                                                                                                                                         
They just started playing in my Superbowl.                                                                                                                                                                                            
I am currently making a touchdown pass                                                                                                                                                                                                
Ugh, I'm about to go blow mine up right now... I can feel the dreaded rumbly in my tumbly                                                                                                                                             
I¡¯m doing it as we speak                                                                                                                                                                                                              
I'm taking the browns to super bowl in 3........2.......................................still trying................1................ .1/2 ......................................ugh I need more fiber................. 0 !!! Finally.
Well look at John Smellway over here                                                                                                                                                                                                  
They did win the Superbowl, they just changed their name to the Ravens first                                                                                                                                                          
Injury, meet insult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
i wasn't certain a comment could cut deeper for a Brown's fan than OP's comment...and then here you show up                                                                            Injury, meet insult.

Nope, the Ravens are technically a new expansion team, the Browns are still the old browns because they sued. Can't have it both ways.                                                                                      
The football organization relocated.                                                                                                                                                                                        
The city took it to court and the binding resolution left the official record, trademarks, and other team-defining features under Cleveland ownership. The Ravens are not the Browns in any facet or official understanding;
For all practical purposes, they did, but officially the rebooted Browns own the history of the old Browns.                                                                                                                 
What is this post about again? Football? Naaa I never watched that shit                                                                                                                                                     
Thanks, Guy-who-publically-hates-sports.Next up - a vegan who had something to say about the state of animal farming.                                                                                                       
Same chance that we¡¯re allowed to talk about fight club                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Dude ssshhhhh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
If this happens in the draft they win the Superbowl easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Stupid comment but I'm upvoting you for your username.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
I'm pretty sure that's about 90% of my upvote intake                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
redditors make it easy, don't they?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
The same as seeing the real footage of Doc Ellis's LSD-No-No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
So we might see it in 20 years?

Jeez, thats rough dude, thanks for keeping the animals in their cage though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I just do it because it pays well, and jails are almost always desperate for people. Easy way to get good money for a guy like me. The people who need appreciation are the medical staff. These guys get paid well below state average, and all they get all day is these guys yelling at them, harassing them, asking for everything under the sun from them. I've seen some of the mental health case workers go a whole day without sitting down. Just from one cell to the next. I couldn't do it, especially since some of these people have some really fucked up crimes. The last three I can remember looking up are object rape of a minor, aggravated assault - guy shot a child, but we don't differentiate that with this specific crime -, and a guy with three counts of aggravated murder and kidnapping, though I think one of the murders was dropped down. Then these guys say that they're feeling a bit down and mental health comes in and talks to them about their feelings for like an hour. I can hardly talk to these guys, I can't imagine listening to them tell me about their personal issues for an hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
My little brother was assigned to Mannheim prison as a guard there and I am certain it changed him as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Some people do change, but it seems like such a rarity. They talk about the social programs as just a means of getting out of the jail physically without actually caring about the program, and we've even busted some for drugs while they were attending drug rehab programs. Some of them aren't in a position for changing their lifestyles because of their environment, especially with the homeless. We can rehabilitate them, get them to kick their addictions, then they're like normal, functioning human beings. They'll talk to you, they'll shower, they'll clean their rooms, they'll play games, watch TV, play handball. They'll be just like any other joe you run into on the streets. Then they get out, and guess what? They've got nowhere to go but back to the homeless shelter. And guess who's waiting at the homeless shelter? Their only friend, the neighborhood drug dealer. He's not really a friend, because what friend is okay with you killing yourself on heroin and crack? But what else do they have? Their lives suck, most don't have family, most can't get jobs, most have nothing to their name. Even if they had something when they got booked in, the homeless shelter is full of desperate drug addicts who will steal from the other homeless. So it's just a matter of time that they turn to their only coping method - drugs. That right there is the majority of the prisoners I've dealt with. I've switched to a section that deals with more heinous crimes now, but I can almost guarantee that it's going to be the same story
Thank for your response. In case you misunderstood I meant that my brother was a guard at a military prison in Germany, as an MP. There were many inmates there for very serious crimes and life sentences. In short, a brutal environment for a 19 year old soldier. When he came back from Europe to be in a family wedding, he had changed in subtle but important ways. I would say they made him a better police officer, later, but it was sad to realize he was getting exposed to some pretty corrosive people and situations, daily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Oh yeah, I did misread haha. I don't think the jail has changed me yet, except going in I thought I would be helping people, or working with people who had made a mistake or just needed a bit of help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Between him and Ian Watkins, there is no question that there is true evil in this world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
You know, I had no idea who they were but I'm gonna take your word on this and not read it. Thanks, internet stranger. I don't need this evil in my life right now.

Now I want to read even more of these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Seriously, if you can stomach it you should become a homicide investigator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
No thanks, I prefer acting and working on movies. Not to mention reading a transcript is nothing comparable to all of the fucked up shit a homicide investigator actually deals with. I can read some disturbing words on a page and think it's super interesting, but I don't want to find a gutted human being and smell the blood and rot. Then have to actually look at what happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Fair enough, but to think that guy did exactly what he said in the transcript to his victims is beyond fucked up, and to be an investigator looking at that kind of crime scene... Like I said, incredibly disturbing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
You may be interested in clemency petitions for pardons. I used to read the state penitentiary ones when a death row inmate was up for execution. You sympathize with the murderer and their last plea, then you read the plea from the family of the murdered and sympathize with them for wanting the person to be executed. But when you read the full police report, court notes, judges recommendation, psyc evaluation and everything you can¡¯t help but say this person needs to get what¡¯s coming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
I really dont want to watch the video, is it from that one guy(my memory of the event might be incorrect, could be thinking of something totally different) who like locked women in a trailer or something and then sexually tortured them?

Yea fuck that, I remember somewhere hearing the audio of what he used to play for his victims before he started torturing them. It was sick

I disagree. I think there is a lot to learn about the darker side of the human spirit here. I think pretending that that darkness doesn't to some degree exist within yourself (as it does in all people) is naive, and seeing it all out in the open is important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
If you want to learn about the darker side of humanity, try reading about Oskar Dirlewanger or something like unit 731.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Uh, you weren't kidding. I got to tape III and didn't want to continue reading. Had enough and didn't need to go any further into that depraved mind.

I would seriously advise against it, not because its "too much to handle" but because i guarantee afterward you'll think "I really didn't need to read that"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
And yet somehow this recorded transcript is less creepy and horrifying than just reading the transcript. As soon as Minscota mentioned unreleased recordings, I knew what they were. I won't put myself through that again. After Shoveldog and Cartel beheads a dude, I cannot ever again.

It is actually the worst thing I've seen on the internet, and I grew up during the two-girls-one-cup hype.

Its my bad I went back and looked. It was the lead detective on the Bittaker case and other people intimate with the case knowledge. Bittaker to my knowledge was the most brutal serial killer in the last 90 years and filmed everything. They use his specific tapes to desensitize FBI agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Shit, John Douglass did profiles on 'em and said they were the worst of the worst. Wonder if they'll be in season 2 of MindHunter.
